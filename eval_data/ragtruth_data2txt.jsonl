This isn't my first time waiting here over 30minutes for food which is beyond ridiculous. I've ordered different things and they all take so long. I don't know if they're just short staffed but this is not acceptable in any restaurant business especially if this is a continuous problem. My boyfriend ordered a sandwich which they left sitting on their rack for 10min while my pasta was nowhere to be seen. I was sick of their tendency to just hang out, have conversations amongst each other, and not care about their hungry customers. I went to the front and asked them if that plate on the rack was for us and they said that it just came out and were waiting for my pasta to come out. That sandwich did NOT JUST come out but obviously they were too busy with their conversations to realize it was there. Whatever, I brought it to my table and we waited another 10 minutes for my pasta. I saw two plates again sitting on the rack for about 5mins and I told myself if none of those are mine, I'm going to leave. Well it turns out none of them were mine and one server who was aware of our situation came to notify us that due to the delay, he had refunded my entire bill. Great. So I'm still hungry. The food is most likely going to take more time. I got my money back. I'm not waiting anymore. So my boyfriend and I left. \n\nThe food is so good that I would've given this place 5 stars but unfortunately, the staff is a big miss.

We arrived at noon and were the only ones there. The large and lush patio was great since the weather was nice, and my bowl of spicy soup noodles hit the spot. \n\nI used to live in Hong Kong and have traveled in Asia quite a bit. While I can't quite call what I ate \"traditional\" in some respects, it was delicious. For around $11.80, I got a big bowl of tasty mala soup (at just the right spice level after I asked for it \"da la\" \u5927\u9ebb) with four ingredients. \n\nI chose vermicelli, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, and tofu rolls. Each was super tasty! I was a little disappointed as I had asked the friendly cashier/server if the tofu roll was the crispy beancurd roll from hotpot and he said yes, but it wasn't. It was more like rolled tofu skin--still tasty though. The broccoli was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the cabbage soaked up the delicious mala oils while the vermicelli provided the \"umph\" to the dish. The soup came topped with sliced spring onions and a generous dollop of chili sauce with sesame seeds. \n\nA little while into our meal, the server came over with two cups of mung bean soup for my friend and I. He said the chef had decided to make up a batch and gave it to us on the house. It was a nice balance of sweet to match the spicy soup, and had a liberal serving of perfectly cooked mung beans at the bottom. \n\nThe only downside was the place's lack of nice utensils. Though I ordered my meal \"for here,\" it came with a small plastic spoon and disposable wooden chopsticks. I carry my own chopsticks, so no worries there (BYO people, be green!), but the spoon was sad. I want to eat a lovely soup like that with a proper Chinese soup spoon that has room for me to arrange the perfect bite with my chopsticks. The silly little plastic one just didn't cut it.

Who pay their hotel rooms in full nowadays anyways? Most smart people pay their hotel rooms with points or mileage affiliated with credit cards company. Originally we booked for double beds. However a day before, I received an email from them that my room was changed to single bed. This is quite impossible to our situation since we have 2 adults and 2 children. So I called (many times) to our credit card company and to Ritz to make sure we would get 2 double beds instead of 1 single king bed. The number of phone calls to change the number of beds did not happen only in one call, unfortunately. I had to call them several times before our arrival. \n\nSo, arrival day, we got our 2 double beds. Perfect. Checking in was a smooth process. The receptionist was polite, explaining us everything about the resort. By the way, the resort has so many activities that you could book first through their website. And I also appreciate the concierge emailed us days before reminding us about the activities on the days we stay. (Tips: the receptionist offered us a transportation like a luggage cart to transport the guests to your villas, ACCEPT IT! Ritz carlton property is so huge that you can even get lost in the area. You can walk if you want to reach your 10k steps, though). \n\nWhen we got to our hotel, problem arise. Tv did not work. I called the receptionist, and the technician came after an hour later. They tried their best to fix tv, unfortunately the problem was much bigger than they expected. The sad part was they KNEW the tv was broken already and Ritz didn't even solve the problem. (Technician told me our previous guest also had the same problem - broken tv). So, me just being me, asking for a compensation for the broken tv. The technician was very generous giving us $100 restaurant fee.  And I took it with my grateful heart. \n\nResort wise; this property again has a lot activities that you can do with your kids, partners, etc. Hiking by the beach is the most popular activities done by my people. Biking around the area also a great thing to do. \n\nDuring check out time, there was a bit problem since I wanted to redeem the $100 certificate that the technician gave me. A bit miscommunication happened at that time, but they resolved it quickly.\n\nWould I recommend you guys to stay here? if you have $1000 extra to spare for staying a night here, sure you should. \nDon't forget to add\nParking vallet is $53 a day\nResort fee is $50 a day. (that's why maximise the property since you're charged hefty for resort fee). \n\nOther than that, yes I would stay again here. Hopefully I can bump this review to 4 star next time."}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2021-12-28 21:00:04", "review_text": "Amazing hotel with such such comfy rooms.

Overall, it was a little pricey but IF it's good I am willing to pay it. \n\nSo, I am really bummed out to report that I was really disappointed by the food. I wanted to like it so much I thought for sure this would be my new go-to BBQ place! But, one of the biggest things was they didn't give me any of their \"famous BBQ sauce\" and that's really what felt like was missing from the brisket. \n\nThe sides were ok. I thought the Mac and cheese was a little dry/bland but with a little salt and pepper on it, it helped. I thought the potato salad with bacon was pretty good but needed something acidic to break down all the starchiness. The beans with bacon was good - probably my favorite side of the 3.\nI'd be willing to give it another try in the future WITH their BBQ sauce though, so don't totally count me out!"}, {"review_stars": 5.0, "review_date": "2020-09-27 04:52:17", "review_text": "Loved our family feast!

To be fair i warned them when they were kids: your uncle is going to expect to be paid back for all the driving, picking up, leaving off, etc., etc., i did for you. So NOW is that time.\nBut for now i am relishing the well earned attention. And i'm only 1/2 kidding here in any event.\nSeveral weeks ago my niece told me about Neighbor Tim's both as a food truck and a stand alone BBQ joint.\nI zipped into SB and asked her to bring some BBQ for me, her kids and hubby as well as for my sisters. She raved about this place. So i thought: ok, sounds good: so bring me some, please.\nWell bring me some she did:\nPork ribs\nBrisket\nPotato Salad\nMac and cheese\nWhite Bread thick sliced\nSauce: Amazing Sauce it is called\nBurnt Ends (from another time but reviewed here)\nThe ribs were perfectly cooked and meaty. I am a purist when it comes to ribs. they must be tender and juicy but not falling off the bone meaning i pick one up and the meat falls off. That is too well cooked, usually cooked with too much moisture and not enough heat or smoke.\nThese ribs though were well smoked, well seasoned (not too salty) and were delivered w/o sauce which is the way i prefer them so that you can taste the meat and not just the sauce. The sauce btw is super also: vinegary, light on the sugars with a snappy chili finish: north carolina style which surprised me only because i thought this was a Texas style BBQ joint. But it works so why fight it. \nThe Brisket was also well seasoned and smoked as well as very moist and tender. No knife needed to cut and we made sammys using the white bread and dipping in the sauce to finish.\nThe Mac and cheese is nothing special: just cheese sauce and noodles. This needed salt and pepper for starters. \nThe potato salad was a big letdown also: the dressing was good and in the right proportion: neither too much or not enough but again salt and pepper would have helped and acid is needed desperately. Pickles, mustard, maybe or both?  Also most damning is that the potatoes were slightly undercooked. in other words too al dente for my taste. \nThick white bread was in the Texas toast style and it was real tasty: reminded me of a traditional pullman loaf. Yeasty, high quality bread not Wonder Bread, remember?\nThe burnt ends were not part of this order but we had these about 4 weeks ago and they were absolutely first rate: charred, and well seasoned to within an inch of their lives. Tim's are made from the deckle of the brisket i am going to assume and are super tasty chunks of beefy goodness. Next day you can thinly slice and use in a taco or sammy or just to pop in your mouth while pretending to grab a beer from the refer.\nAll in all a very good sampling today of Neighbor Tim's wares:  what they do well they do very, very well.

Back in the 1990's I used to be on the local 'sound guys' that would turn up and try and make sure people could hear the bands.\n\nSoho was absolutely one of the places where I used to do sound and sit against the wall behind what was basically a TV tray with a Mackie 1604 on it for $40 a night plus free drinks.  It was dark and kind of dingy but thats what they were all like back in the world of analog.\n\nHow times have changed in 20+ years (which is essentially the amount of time its been since i have been to Soho).\n\nIve heard people talk about it recently but never put much thought into it as I used to work there - still had the idea of a dark, hole in the wall type place in my brain.\n\nWell, last night the wife tells me that we have a date night.  Sweet!   It had been some time since we had been able to get out together.  I didnt know that local hero Chris Schiflett was going to be playing so having dinner with the wife was going to be icing on the cake for sure.\n\nWe had the hamburger and the raviolis both of which were great.  The burger was excellent which frankly is really saying something with the burger game being what it is these days.  Tender, moist, lots of flavor - steak fries done properly which is a little crispy and not doughy and hot enough to burn my mouth!   Yes!!\nThe raviolis are very similar to the ones I have had at Ca'Dario and were excellent.\n\nOver drinks we had a Creme Brule as well and that was also delicious.\n\nInto the room for the show and do you know how you can tell how the sound is pretty good?  When you dont notice it.\n\nWhile getting my audio engineering degree years ago, I realized that the best sound people are ones that you never notice.  Which is kind of sad but it absolutely true - Ive always said that a good sound are like good windshield wipers: if they are doing their job properly, you'll never know they are there.\n\nHalf way through the show, I realized that I had just been enjoying the show and not critiquing how it sounded and it hit me - thats because the sound was good!  How refreshing and thank you kind engineer, whomever you are.\n\n\nI was properly blown away last night at our visit to Soho.  Food was great, the venue is great, the staff are helpful, the bathrooms are modern and functional, the sound was great....  I may not have even recognized it had I been teleported - they have done an incredible job right down to the super modern and very fancy bathrooms.\n\nIll be back here just for dinner - not even for a show but I will absolutely be back for both. \n\nWell done, Soho!

I don't get over to the Mesa much but when I saw a coupon in a mailed flyer a couple months ago, I clipped it.  It offered a free entree with purchase of one entree and two drinks. Even with a discount of $12, the bill was $53 for lunch (before tip) -- I can eat a great dinner out for less than this -- so I was expecting a very delicious meal.  Both my companion and I felt the food was vastly overpriced for the quality, flavor and even presentation. The quantity was generous enough but the items we ordered (empanadas and the mushroom burger) were both rather bland.  The \"burger\" was served on a doughy, barely cooked pita-like bread rather than on an appropriate item to hold a messy burger in place like a brioche bun.  It was completely falling apart after a few bites... which would have been okay to eat with a fork except it was just not flavorful or complex given the list of ingredients. The most interesting item was the ketchup made from beets.  Also the side fries weren't thoroughly cooked except for the smallest ones.  Definitely not a $24 item! The empanadas were somewhat better but again, not a 'wow' and not even a 'hey, really tasty.' Just bland and again, not worth $24.  The half-off discount didn't even cover the $13 cost of a chai tea and lemonade (that was mostly ice of course).  All in all, very disappointing food and therefore completely overpriced.  We took the food to go so I cannot really comment on the service. When I read another lengthy review (12/5/21), I now see that the prices have been jacked and the quality has been wavering.

We weren't in a huge rush, but we didn't have hours to dine, because I had dough proofing at home and needed to attend to it. Hubby walked in and checked in with waitress and came out saying we should take any seat we wanted and she'd be right out with menus. So, we sat next to the Xmas tree on the patio and waited... and waited... and waited.\n\nWe figured she couldn't see us so we moved right next to the front door, where she couldn't miss us. After waiting several minutes, I decided we would wait 5 more minutes and then find somewhere else for dinner. After 3 minutes, a 30-something brunette waitress came and dropped off menus. I let her know the table was wobbly and she said she'd bring a block for it (which she never did). Oddly, I detected a twinge of attitude from the waitress with that exchange... not sure why, but there was an element of nastiness in her tone. She also turned on the table-side heater, which was very effective, if somewhat atmosphere-killing, because of its very bright coils.\n\nI pulled up Yelp to look at the pics of the entrees and we settled on what we wanted to order. After about 5 more minutes, the waitress returned and informed us that dinner would take longer here than other restaurants. I let her know I was proofing dough at home and if we ordered immediately, how long would it take. She replied that if we ordered faster, the food would come faster. (Duh! Crazy how that works!) Again, a twinge of nastiness.\n\nHubby and I heard the specials and I asked her to repeat the sides on one of the specials. Attitude was ramping up from her. I asked her what her favorite item on the menu was and she replied, \"I can't say. You're the one who's going to eat it, not me! The chef wouldn't even tell you.\" \n\nI didn't dare ask another question, because she was in full beeeyatch mode. We both ordered off the regular menu. Then, she said it would be 20 minutes and we ordered wine. Before she left, I asked the waitress if she could please ask the chef not to hold the entree until we finished the appetizer... just to put it all in at once. Her response? \"The chef doesn't need to be micromanaged like that.\" And that, my Yelp friends, was my limit to the abuse I was going to take from this witch of a waitress.\n\nI smiled and said thank you, but we aren't going to stay. She said okay, opened the door, walked into the restaurant, and I could hear her behind me exclaiming with a groan as she entered, \"Oh my Gaaaaawwwdd.\"\n\nGood thing they're in a tourist zone, because Petit Valentien can have a fresh supply of customers the waitress can abuse. As for this local, I'd recommend one of our other many fine dining establishments and give this one a wide berth, if service is important to you.\n\nTwo last comments: First, we noticed the restaurant had a Help Wanted sign posted, looking for servers, which could hint that maybe the attitude starts at the top and they have a hard time keeping servers. Second, I noticed another one of the local Yelp Elite crew (and other reviewers) also commented on the rude and inattentive service here.

I jumped to hug her and kiss her and hug her and kissed her some more.\n\nI came home and the mother of the bride carried the bottom tier and we went back to Montecito Confections to be saved by Katie.  We arrived and she said where is the rest of the cake?  I did not want to take advantage so we just took the biggest tier.  She said:  Bring it!\n\nHome we went after hugging Katie and kissing her some more and got help and left with two more tiers.  Katie my angel covered the three tiers!!! She was my angel.  The mother of the bride broke in tears, I guess she was worried that I was never going to serve the wedding cake.  These were tears of relief!  We ended up having the most beautiful cake and thanks to Katie.  Katie also build the cake, putting all three tiers together.  Then explained to me how to decorate it.  She told me to get a photo of the container of her fondant because she had tried all the different brands and that was the best of them all.

There's indoor and outdoor seating and the cute Asian couple that owns it are so nice and sweet. \n\nI got the lunch combo with chicken teriyaki and California roll -- it comes with miso soup, rice, salad and 2 egg rolls. The miso soup was authentic and delicious, the teriyaki chicken was sweet/savory and grilled to perfection with bits of charred ends, the egg rolls were hot and crispy, the California roll was fresh and moist, and the salad was tossed with a tasty sesame ginger dressing. In terms of flavor, it's honestly on par with a lot of real Japanese restaurant bento lunches. \n\nIt was also a lot of food for under $15!

Get food poisoning\n\nTrust me this was NOT the intention.\n\nMy wife and I were so excited when Cielo's finally opened it's doors to the public after weeks of renovations after the take over of Cabo's.  Cabos' was one of our favorite go to spots for lunch and were hoping that Cielo's captured us as a regular the way it's predecessor did.\n\nWhen we arrived we did notice the positives. The interior was definitely upgraded as the booths give it a more restaurant ambiance.  The bathrooms were nicely done and very clean.\n\nWe sat in the front patio overlooking Carpinteria Blvd and took our first look at the new menus.  First thing we notice were the prices were about 25% higher than Cabos which is cool if the food warranted that price.  It's the standard beach diner fare with a bit of a higher end take on it.  Sliders, burgers, chicken plates, salads, apps, etc.   Were were disappointed at the price of the drinks (house margs were $10) and NO pitchers of margs anymore!  That sucked as that was one of the highlights of Cabos.   \n\nFirst time there we ordered the sliders.  Not bad but not great.  Heavy jalapeno overrode the beefy flavor of the meat.  They had a nice dessert menu and we ordered the carrot cake.  Not bad but the server had no idea where it was sourced from.  \n\nThe 2nd time we came we ordered the 1/4 chicken plate as that was our favorite dish at Cabo's.  Nightmare thru and thru.  Our plates arrived and we just looked at each other as the rice was in clumps.  Literally.  The rice and beans were cold to the touch and when we cut into the chicken it was RAW.   Dark pink RAW.  We called over the server and she apologized and took it back.  The same plates were returned with the same pieces of chicken grilled to a near burnt crisp (chefs revenge I'm guessing) and the rice and beans were still cold.  We called over the server to let her know and one of the owners came over to apologize.   We told her that we REALLY want to like this place as we LOVED Cabo's but the standards of the restaurant need to start with the standards in the kitchen and there is just NO care for the food here.  Even the cold beans had no flavor.  I texted my brother that we were here and his reply was \"nice patio...terrible food\".  \n\nAnyway unfortunately unless there are some major changes in the kitchen I'm never coming back to Cielo's.

They sat next to me and I noticed that Katie had the same phone as me, a crappy freebie phone they give you when you lose your iphone, and so I said, \"Hey I like your crappy cell-phone, did you lose your iphone like me?\"  As it turned out she had.  We swapped stories about how we had drunkenly lost our phones and after that we just kept talking.  She was making me laugh telling raunchy jokes and I was trying to impress her by weaving beach volleyball stories into the conversation.\n\nThe whole time the bartender kept our drinks flowing and made sure we were having a good time.  At one point when the conversation ran dry and I was about to pay my bill and go. Luckily I got the signal from the bartender, \"stick around, this girl likes you.\" I'm hopelessly ignorant to the subtle signals of the opposite sex, and if I hadn't taken his advice I probably would have blown it.  We kept talking for a while and I finally asked her for her number.  Not only did she give me her number, but she walked with me to my car, gave me a kiss on the cheek, flashed me a smile, and made sure I was going to call her.\n\nNeedless to say, I did.  We met up a few days later for drinks and we had a great time.  We've been hanging out pretty steadily for a few weeks now and things are going really well.

In many ways, it offered a solid choice for our party of 10. That said, the overall impression we had was that the food was fairly ordinary. Pasta dishes were served with overcooked pasta and sauces that were unspectacular. Salads were copious, but almost entirely lettuce with lots of shredded cheese. Bread was uninspiring. Only bottled water (not tap) was offered. The one exception was a pork chop that was reportedly quite substantial and cooked exactly right. Wine choices were good, but overpriced compared to other restaurants nearby. Perhaps it was the size of our party, but our overall impression was that the restaurant isn't really trying. At the end of the meal, we had a mixup with the credit cards. Instead of splitting the bill evenly, several of us got credit card receipts for the entire party of 10!
