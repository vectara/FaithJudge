Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at the company's Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of Blue Bell ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not affect other Blue Bell ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But Blue Bell has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the Broken Arrow facility \"out of an abundance of caution\" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time Blue Bell has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the Broken Arrow plant in April 2014, Blue Bell said. And, according to the CDC, listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the CDC said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate outbreak in Texas, the CDC did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce Blue Bell cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. \"Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,\" the CDC said. In early March, in light of the Kansas listeria outbreak, Blue Bell recalled a group of products made at a plant in Texas. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in Kansas from listeria that might be linked to Blue Bell Creameries products, according to the CDC. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the CDC said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream before developing the infection. \"We are devastated and know that Blue Bell has to be and can be better than this,\" Paul Kruse, Blue Bell CEO and president, said in a statement. \"Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected.\" The CDC advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website, Blue Bell said \"this recall in no way includes Blue Bell ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups.\" This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of Blue Bell Creameries, the company said. Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, and primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the CDC. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the United States, an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year, and approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters.

The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, wrote, \"We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.\" Brian Stelter: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is:. Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The Virginia Supreme Court said in Jordan v. Kollman that \"the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent.\" \"Actionable\" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also the Virginia Constitution. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the Rolling Stone article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \"true.\" The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The Columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate UVA. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in American jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with Phi Kappa Psi. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \"of or concerning\" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is \"concerning\" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about \"a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue.\" If I said, \"The 1980 Philadelphia Phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals\" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the \"small group\" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand, Rolling Stone's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of Greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your Aunt Edna calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are \"between jobs,\" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The UVA situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"An outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors has found that the Rolling Stone article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia was deeply flawed and that the magazine failed in its reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking.

Following the apology, the question has arisen as to whether the University, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity or any of the other fraternities on campus can sue for defamation.

The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring \"I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.\"  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks \"should be done away with;\" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, \"We have an African-American President.\" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: \"With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.\" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.

The photographer, Daniel Ramos, had filed the civil suit against West  after the hip-hop star attacked him and tried to wrestle his camera from him in July 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport. West pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor count of battery over the scuffle. A judge sentenced him to two years' probation, as well as anger management sessions and community service. Ramos and his lawyer, Gloria Allred, sought general and punitive damages in the civil suit, saying that West had interfered with the photographer's rights to pursue a lawful occupation.

The original incident was caught on video, including the following exchange. \"Kanye! Kanye! Talk to me, Kanye!\" Ramos shouts outside a terminal at the Los Angeles airport on the night of July 19, 2013. \"What's' going on? Why can't we talk to you?  I mean, why?\" he asks as West moves through a group of paparazzi. \"Now come on, Kanye, I don't want to fight with you,\" he says as West advances toward him. \"I told you, don't talk to me, right,\" West says. \"You're trying to get me in trouble so I step off and have to pay you like $250,000.\" West is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands. West retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer. \"We believe that this case sent an important message,\" Allred said. \"Celebrities are not above the law, and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question.\" Beverly Hills Police investigated an incident in January 2014 in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a Beverly Hills chiropractor's office.

The Hawks were not involved in the stabbing incident, police said, but were arrested on obstruction and other charges later. Though New York Police Department Det. Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street. \"1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue,\" the statement said. The statement continued, \"A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision.\" Copeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement. The suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, \"Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody.\" Charges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said. Copeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a \"bloody trail of handprints\" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland \"almost landed right next to the club,\" the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club. The club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said. A male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said. Sefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said. Word of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said. \"We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time,\" the players said in a joint statement released by the team. \"We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them.\" The Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said. Police released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey. The Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital. \"We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured,\" Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement. Copeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, \"We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait.\" The NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident. \"We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,\" Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email. Copeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m. Copeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC. There was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported. Saltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23. Images published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side. Antic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported. The Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference. Tuesday's win over the Suns marked a franchise-best 58 wins in a season for the club. The Pacers sit in the conference's 10th spot but are only one game out of playoff contention.

A lot of the new fans that did not get to experience what Selena was about hopefully will be able to get a sense of her with this new technology that's going to be coming out.\" Selena: 20 years after her death.

Selena will be the first figure to use the Acrovirt technology, Quintanilla said. \"I'm excited at the fact that she will be the first ever, and the fact that she's a Latina makes it even more awesome,\" she said. \"It's not about replacing Selena in any shape, way or form; it's just something to help her legacy continue growing.\" The family intends to expand her legacy in another way: with some new music. Selena the One \"will release new songs and videos, will collaborate with current hit artists, and aims to go on tour in 2018,\" said a statement on Selena's Facebook page.

Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. \"At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint,\" Jamie Davis said.  \"That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us.\" As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. \"At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known,\" said Troi Ge.  \"He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'\" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" Collins said. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening.

He was born in American Samoa, a U.S. territory since 1900. He has been subject to American law his whole life and thinks he should be a citizen. The Constitution would agree.  The Fourteenth Amendment declares that \"All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" Yet, Afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen.  How can it be, in the 21st century, that Americans born on U.S. soil are denied the rights of citizenship? That injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of American Samoa to join the United States.  It is a wrong that Afalava and other American Samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the D.C. Circuit. A decision could come any day. Since the United States was established, it adhered to the rule that those born on U.S. lands were U.S. citizens.  The rule is colorblind, yet the only exception that the Supreme Court has ever declared was not. The infamous Dred Scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free African-Americans had \"no rights that the white man was bound to respect.\"  Though they were Americans, they were not citizens under the Constitution. A Civil War later, the 14th Amendment reversed the ruling in the Dred Scott case. Today, the Dred Scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court. But racial discrimination didn't end there. In 1904, a Puerto Rican woman named Isabel Gonzalez sailed for New York.  Because Puerto Rico was U.S. territory, she believed herself to be a U.S. citizen.  But officials at Ellis Island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland.  She sued, with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling. Yet the Supreme Court that eventually heard Gonzalez's case was still racist.  In preceding years, for example, it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the Chinese race. And, in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as Puerto Rico, the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class U.S. territories.  Justice Edward Douglas White's opinion stated that U.S. sovereignty extended over them, but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other Americans.  He did so, he privately revealed, because \"he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions.\" In the Gonzalez case, the justices agreed unanimously that Puerto Ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws.  But they declined to decide whether or not Gonzalez was a citizen.  Though preoccupied by fears that islanders were \"savages\" and racially unfit for citizenship, they were unwilling to violate the Constitution. As a result of the court ruling, federal officials were able to deny Gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years. As Isabel Gonzalez's lawyer told the Court, declaring that residents of America's island territories are not U.S. citizens would mean adding to \"precedents in our history of which we are least proud.\" Those precedents, he warned the Court, had been \"repudiated by the American people in the Civil War, by three amendments to the Constitution of the United States, by this court, and by ... advancing civilization.\" Surely, 147 years after the Dred Scott case was overturned, the time has come to put an end to this farce. In the past century, the inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have become citizens. Today, Emy Afalava and his fellow American Samoans are the last Americans still waiting to become citizens.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Emy Afalava, a decorated veteran born in American Samoa, a US territory since 1900, has been denied the right to vote as the federal government insists he is not a citizen.

The sisters were born in the Somali capital but were forced to flee after war broke out in 1991. Along with their parents, the girls relocated to Canada as refugees where during their teens they discovered a passion for music. Heading south to LA by way of Atlanta, the singing sisters with a bold flair for fashion are now embarking on a musical journey, gearing up to unleash their Afro-pop sound to the world. CNN's African Voices caught up with the sister act -- known collectively as Faarrow (combining the translation of their names into English -- Iman means \"Faith\" and Siham means \"Arrow\") to talk about music, aspirations and Somalia. CNN: Hi guys, thanks for chatting with me today. What are some of your musical influences? Iman: We love Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie -- stuff my mom would listen to and play -- and the Spice Girls. We used to die for the Spice Girls. I love new artists now but I don't know if it's a nostalgia, but I remember ... my mom used to pump whatever -- Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston. CNN: You are working on your debut album now -- how's that been? Siham: We've been working with Elijah Kelley -- he's actually an actor. He was in \"Hairspray,\" \"The Butler,\" and most recently he was in the George Lucas animation, \"Strange Magic.\" That's what he's more known for but his first passion is music. He's an incredible producer, writer and singer. I just felt like he was always the missing piece. He brought everything together. CNN: So now that you've found your \"missing piece,\" how would you describe your sound? Siham: Our music before was experimenting with Afrobeat sounds but now it's more of a fusion (of what) we are inspired by. It's pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic African percussion. It's a fusion of everything. CNN: And do you guys write the songs as well? Siham: The entire album was pretty much (written and produced) by me, my sister and Elijah. And when we signed we already had a lot of those songs already done. Warner Brothers Records is really great in that way that they already loved what we were doing and let us do our own thing. CNN: What are you listening to right now? Siham: Oh my God, there's so many! Iman: Sia with \"Chandelier.\" Siham: I really love this new song -- I don't know if Iman is going to agree with me -- but his name's LunchMoney Lewis, it's called Bills; I love it. CNN: As well as your music, you both work with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- how did you start your humanitarian work? Iman: Ever since we were kids we wanted to help Somalia, we always talked about it. But we were like \"what can we physically do?\" We were doing some research and we called our mom and she said 'You know you still have family over there. There's a refugee camp in Kenya and your great uncle and his kids live in a refugee camp.' And we did some research about Dadaab refugee camp, it's a massive camp that has taken in Sudanese refugees, Somali refugees, Rwandan refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict. Everybody fled to Dadaab. In the beginning (it was) pure advocacy talking about it on Twitter and Facebook. CNN: But then you decided to \"up your game\" as it were... Iman: Yes, then we started a non-profit and we'd do small benefit concerts in Toronto and in San Diego -- wherever there was a big Somali community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing, working with UNHCR in a capacity as a spokesperson. We headlined World Refugee Day at the Kennedy Center, as well as the Nansen Awards twice in Geneva. We felt like this platform of singing -- the bigger it gets, the more we can do. Siham: We obviously love fashion so we wanted to do our own socially conscious brand so we've been making these bracelets and necklaces called \"Wish Creatively.\" Wish stands for \"Women Internationally Selling Hope.\" We wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in Kenya or Somalia with women providing them with a sustainable income. CNN: So what's next for you two? Siham: We're actually in the mixing process right now. We still have a few (tracks) to finish up but the majority of the album is pretty much done. We want to turn it in as soon as possible so they can put together a rollout plan and get ready for the first single to drop. Iman: I don't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for Somalia. I feel like now because we followed our dreams it's like 'they're not just refugees anymore.' We don't have to become doctors so we can one day give back to Somalia and help rebuild -- it's such a beautiful dream but not ours. In our culture, anything creative is not really respected or appreciated. But I feel like now but even with our new deal we're still trucking along. I feel like we inspire people.

Not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion Catholic souls, he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country. As scholars like to say, the Vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries. Sometimes, as when St. John Paul II stood up to Communist Poland, the church's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch. At other times, popes have to make a hard choice: Adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat? This Sunday in Rome, Pope Francis faced just such a dilemma. First, the back story:. One hundred years ago, more than 1 million Armenians (some estimates run as high as 1.5 million) died at the hand of the Turks. Many of the victims were part of a branch of Christianity closely aligned with Catholicism. A slew of  historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a \"genocide.\" (A U.S. resolution to do the same has languished in Congress.) Turkish officials disagree, arguing that the deaths, while unfortunate, were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides. For their part, previous popes had finessed the genocide question. John Paul II used the \"g\" word in 2001, but didn't dare speak it out loud. Instead, it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the Armenian church, after they had celebrated Mass together. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI called the killings \"a great evil\" and \"terrible persecution\" in a speech 2006, but avoided labeling them genocide. (Benedict found other ways to tick off the Turks, initially opposing their entry into the European Union.) As Pope Francis prepared to celebrate a special Mass Sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter,  Vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word \"genocide.\" He did, but in a roundabout way, by quoting John Paul's document. \"In the past century, our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies,\" Francis said. \"The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th century,' struck your own Armenian people.\" The middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by John Paul. In citing his predecessor, Francis highlighted one of the Vatican's chiefest concerns, especially on matters of moral import: continuity. Whether holding the line against artificial birth control, declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions, it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins. \"The Vatican and the papacy love continuity,\" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Vatican analyst for National Catholic Reporter. If Francis had not called the Armenian killings a genocide, particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included Armenia's President -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy, Reese said. At the same time, Francis didn't want to anger the Turks more than necessary, especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of Christians by ISIS in the Middle East, which the Pope alluded to in his speech on Sunday. \"The fact that he quoted John Paul is a sign that he's downplaying it,\" Reese said of the Armenian murders. \"He's telling people: There's nothing new here.\" New or not, Turkey was not happy. The nation recalled its Vatican ambassador for \"consultations\" just hours after Francis' comments, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said. Turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart, the Vatican's ambassador, for a meeting, Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported. In a tweet Sunday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called the Pope's use of the word \"unacceptable\" and \"out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis.\" \"Religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations,\" the tweet reads. \"Hatred\" and \"animosity\" are not words often used to describe Pope Francis. Because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world, emphasizing mercy over judgment, it's easy to miss the bluntness Francis brings to the bully pulpit. On matters of doctrine and diplomacy, he may be carrying on Catholic traditions, but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes, this pope is decidedly different. He has helped broker a backroom detente between the United States and Cuba, and invited Israeli and Palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the Vatican (after annoying some Israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the West Bank from Jerusalem.) But Francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop ISIS' slaughter of Christians, warned of the \"Mexicanization\" of Argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch. On Monday, the Pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning Mass. He must have heard the hubbub about his \"genocide\" remark, but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly, without fear, and to bear the courage of their convictions, just as the early apostles had. \"We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard,\" Francis said. CNN's Gul Tuysuz  and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Pope Francis held a special Mass on Sunday to commemorate the Armenian genocide of 1915 and referred to the massacre as the \"first genocide of the 20th century\".

Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed the second remote-controlled robot last week after the first one broke down. The robot detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, an indicator that cooling systems were working effectively, according to a statement released by TEPCO. \"It is a great step forward towards the decommissioning work as we can earn necessary data for the next investigation,\" said Akira Ono, the chief of Fukushima Daiichi plant. TEPCO said the yellow seen on the images seemed to suggest a discoloration of the grating, though the cause was unknown. It said the green glow could not be seen when filmed from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter. The first robot, which was sent in on April 10, stalled after moving about 10 meters, according to a statement released by TEPCO.  A report and footage from the robot shows that a fallen object had blocked its path and left it stranded. TEPCO decided to cut off the cable connected to the device on April 12 as it had already collected data on radiation levels in 14 of the 18 targeted locations, completing around two-thirds of the originally planned route. The second robot was sent in on April 15 and collected data from all 11 points, as scheduled. Four years after the devastating nuclear crisis, the radiation levels inside the three damaged reactors are still extremely high and remain unsafe for people to enter. Decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete. TEPCO called the robotic probe an \"unprecedented\" experiment.

But on Tuesday, jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead. Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done. This is the victim impact part of the case, and the testimony was heartbreaking. Four young people are gone, and grief fills the spaces they once occupied. A father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called \"Princess.\" \"Krystle was the light of my life. She was extremely smart, hardworking, beautiful, every father's dream. I miss her a lot,\" said William A. Campbell Sr., dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter, a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 Boston Marathon. She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said. \"Nobody fills that boot now.\" Others are expected to come and cry for Lingzi Lu, \"a jolly soul,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said, quoting the slain Chinese grad student's father. More tears will be shed for Martin Richard, who was 8 and looked just like his dad. And for Sean Collier, who was remembered at his memorial service by these words: \"Big heart, big smiles, big service. All love.\" \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye,\" Pellegrini told the jury. \"And that is the very essence of terror.\" Timeline of bombings, manhunt and aftermath. To understand the toll Tsarnaev's bombs took, jurors must know the stories of his victims, the prosecutor said. \"These young women, this young man and this little boy, all of them were loved and they loved in return,\" Pellegrini said. \"Before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable, they were sons, they were daughters, they were grandchildren, they were brothers and they were sisters.\" Jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling, happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings. There was the photo of Campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit. And then came the one that made her father smile through his tears. She was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform. \"She traded that in for a bat,\" Campbell said. \"She wasn't really a girly girl, but she loved to whitewater, camp, play baseball. She had a good arm on her. I was very proud of her.\" By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held. It is dated July 10, 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon. He glares into the camera defiantly, his middle finger raised in a profane salute. \"This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\" Pellegrini said. \"Without remorse, he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused.\" Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as \"the enemy,\" she said. As a result, two women and a man never reached the age of 30, and a little boy never made it to the third grade. \"He knew they were innocents. He even called them that,\" Pellegrini added, referring to the message Tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings. \"But it didn't stop him from murdering them.\" The people who were maimed by Tsarnaev's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks. The stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of Tsarnaev's trial. When the first of the two bombs went off, Gillian Reny, a senior in high school, was standing near the woman she came to know was  Krystle Campbell. \"There was a complete, utter chilling silence and then chaos. Chaos like I'd never seen and never hope to see again,\" she said. The force of the blast knocked her to the ground. When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere. Her shin bone had snapped and was protruding. \"Muscle was everywhere. It was the most horrifying image I could imagine. Just seeing that on my own body,\" she said, and began to cry. \"I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere.\" Were you bleeding? she was asked. \"Yes, enormously. Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone,\" she said. \"I was terrified that I was going to die. I did not know that I could be that injured and survive.\" She said she began to scream. Her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown. Doctors were able to save Reny's leg, but others weren't so lucky. Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee. An amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from, jurors have learned at this trial. Corcoran was at the finish line, waiting for her sister to cross. \"And then our whole world just exploded,\" she said. \"I unfortunately remember every single detail.\" She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere. \"It's kind of hard to explain but I want to get it right for all of you to understand,\" she told the jury. She said it was \"a surreal, out-of-body experience.\"  She remembers thinking, \"What was that?\" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes. Her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack. By then, she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined. She wondered if she would die. \"It hurt too much. I just didn't care,\" she said. \"I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain.  I knew it was very bad and I was thinking, 'Is this it? Am I going to die?' I remember thinking I wanted to die. The pain was too much. I wanted to die.\" And then, she said, \"the mom in me\" took over. She remembers telling herself: \" 'Hell no, I don't want to die. I have too much living to do. Don't let this be the end. This can't be the end.'\" She remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital, even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs. \"Can I get on with my life? Absolutely,\" she said. But she can never forget she's a double amputee. \"There's always a level of discomfort. Right now I'm not comfortable,\" she said from the witness stand. \"The bottoms of my limbs, there's this constant numb burning sensation. The only way I can describe it is it's like you have the worst athlete's foot in my life.\" Sometimes, she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be. \"You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are,\" she said. \"Inclines are very hard.\" Daily life is literally an uphill battle.

Billboard: 2015 ACM Awards: See All the Photos. But bigger isn't always better. Here's our breakdown of the 10 best and 5 worst moments at the 2015 ACMs. The Best. Eric Church & Keith Urban provide an opening wallop. With a full stadium and millions of home viewers watching, two of country's leading men successfully lit the fuse for the 50th annual ACM Awards with a slick joint kickoff performance. Eric Church's \"Pledge Allegiance To The Hag\" was a fine throwback, but Keith Urban's powerhouse \"Raise 'Em Up\" lived up to its title -- and then some. Setting a Guinness World Record. Not only was this the ACMs biggest audience ever, but the 2015 ACM Awards brought in the biggest audience for a live TV awards show ever. Now that's how you celebrate half a century. Reba McEntire demonstrates how it's done. During a night that found a couple performers sounding a little weak in the vocal department, Reba McEntire showed the entire Cowboys stadium -- and many younger singers who don't have half her energy -- how it's done. Reba is eternal. Taylor Swift singing in the audience. Whether it was during Eric Church or Martina McBride, T-Swift was heating up the audience by singing and swaying along to country staples. Taylor might have gone pop for \"1989,\" but she was deep in the heart of Texas for this annual country extravaganza. Billboard: 2015 ACM Awards: And the Winners Are... Garth Brooks' All-American salute. During Brooks' performance of \"All-American Kid,\" the country giant welcomed a slew of U.S. military representatives into AT&T Stadium, in an emotional moment that put the red, white and blue front and center. Brooks ended the performance by saluting the U.S. armed forces \"who are here and are all around the world for protecting our freedom,\" and also shouted out his home state of Oklahoma, who are grieving 20 years after the Oklahoma City bombing on Sunday. A truly classy moment from one of the best ever. Taylor Swift's mom makes an appearance. Sure, Andrea Swift's presentation of a special award for her daughter came with a fun origin tale about the creation of \"Love Story\" and some lovely words about the 25-year-old superstar. But the sight of the elder Swift -- just days after Taylor confirmed that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer -- walking to the podium was more than enough to yield one of the night's most poignant moments. Christina Aguilera joins Rascal Flatts. Aguilera is far from country, but with a voice as malleable as hers, she can pass for a song or two. After singing a bit of the tune she did while guesting on Nashville, Xtina joined longtime hitmakers Rascal Flatts for \"Riot\" from their recent album \"Rewind.\" Aguilera and Gary LeVox trading vocals was the rare unexpected artist pairing that actually worked. Miranda Lambert domination. In addition to kicking ass during her \"Mama's Broken Heart\"/\"Little Red Wagon\" medley, Lambert justly owned the night when it came to awards. If there's one thing the country community loves more than Miranda Lambert, it's giving Miranda Lambert awards. Billboard: Watch Little Big Town Bring Provocative 'Girl Crush' to ACMs. Little Big Town don't back down. Despite some mild controversy over their song \"Girl Crush,\" Little Big Town brought the poignant ballad to the awards show, giving the ACMs one of its more melancholy moments. Jason Aldean comes on strong. For a night featuring some shaky vocals, Aldean brought his silky yet powerful country croon to the ACMs during a massive medley. It's hard to see an audience get weak in the knees when you're watching at home, but it's fair to assume that's what happened during his performance. The Worst. Tony Romo. The Dallas Cowboys QB was understandably a little stiff on the mic (athletes usually aren't the most charismatic public speakers) but the whole gag with Shelton asking Romo to toss Bryan a pass went on waaaaay too long. On the plus side, Bryan caught the pass. On the other hand, there was a tired play on words about balls. The length. Three hours for the 50th ACMs? Sure, why not. Three and a half hours? That's pushing it. They could have shaved off the last half hour by cutting a couple of the performers who only sang half a song, and shortened a few of the massive commercial breaks. All of the Milestone Awards. Taylor Swift was given an extended honor at this year's ACM Awards, but some of the Milestone Awards -- especially those given to Reba McEntire, Kenny Chesney and George Strait -- seemed rushed for the country giants they were saluting.

Farage, the leader of  the UK Independence Party (UKIP), complains that Britain's membership of the European Union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants, many from impoverished Eastern Europe, into his \"small island\" nation. In a video posted on YouTube, Prince Jan Zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against Poles living in Britain. \"The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr. Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40,\" Zylinksi said. Holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a  World War II war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet. \"Enough is enough, Mr. Farage. So what I'd like to do, Mr. Farage, is to challenge you to a duel,\" he said. \"I would like us to meet in Hyde Park one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman would traditionally do. \"Are you up for it Mr. Farage?\" Farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of Britain's general elections on May 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince. \"It is an impressive sword. I don't have one but I'm sure we could find one if we had to. But I'm not intending to accept the offer,\" a spokesman quoted him as saying. \"I would have thought that a Polish prince with a long Polish lineage would rather agree with me that it's a complete tragedy for Poland that it's lost so many of its brightest and best young people.\" UKIP wants Britain to leave the European Union. It says it would not seek to remain a party to the region's free trade or economic treaties \"while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor, which prevents the UK managing its own borders.\" It has also pledged to cut the country's £9 billion ($12.4B) annual foreign aid budget. Another UKIP politician appeared to back his party leader's chances in a duel, tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two, with the comment: \"This is what Nigel would do to him.\" But there was no word on whether Farage would even accept the prince's less life-threatening back-up challenge. \"Alternatively, if you don't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty, Mr. Farage, we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a TV studio in the run-up to the elections,\" Zylinski suggested. \"I'm up for it, it would be really nice, hopefully you will agree.\" Zylinski posted a separate video on YouTube entitled \"7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,\" in which he pointed to a Times newspaper headline from March reading: \"We need more migrants ... they are the best workers in Britain.\" The headline, he said, applied \"principally\" to the Poles. \"What I cannot accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the Poles. Enough is enough, I say, this has got to stop.\" Zylinski pointed to Polish contributions to Britain including  those made by Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain, what he said was a \"wonderful work ethic\" and easy integration into the community. \"We are often more loyal to Britain than many British people I know,\" he said. \"We are very grateful to be here.

That was because, as he lay on the ground, he was still holding the handles of his son's stroller. He pulled back the stroller's cover and saw that his son, Leo, 3, was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head. Woolfenden checked Leo for other injuries and thought, \"Let's get out of here.\" That was before he noticed his Achilles tendon, which resembled transparent tape covered in blood, and his left tibia protruding from his boot. The boot was next to his left stump, he testified before a federal jury Thursday, the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the Boston Marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The prosecution rested Thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that Tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless. The defense, led by famed death penalty opponent Judy Clarke, is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing. Clarke will begin those efforts Monday. A group of Tsarnaev's relatives arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport on Thursday, CNN affiliate WHDH reported, but it's not clear if they plan to testify. The jury must decide whether the 21-year-old, who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now-deceased brother, will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison. Woolfenden, a biomedical researcher for the Novartis Institutes, recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort Leo. The boy cried, \"Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!\" he testified. Amid the stench of \"burning hair, blood, sulfur,\" a good Samaritan emerged. He gave Woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed Leo to safety. \"I was completely terrified because I didn't know if I was ever going to see my son again. There was blood all over the sidewalk, all around me,\" he said. Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, spent 14 years in the U.S. Army as a combat surgeon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices, he testified, and what he saw in Boston that day wasn't much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones. \"I arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up,\" he said. \"I looked across the patients and I knew immediately, without anyone having to tell me, exactly what the wounding mechanism was.\" Heather Abbott had no such experience, so when one of the two bombs exploded, sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a \"puddle of chaos and blood and glass,\" her instinct was to run. But she couldn't. Her foot felt like it was on fire, she testified. Two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a Hail Mary. She called for her husband. He picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant. \"I saw blood pouring out of my foot,\" she said. She finally got to a hospital, and after three attempts to save her foot, which was missing its entire heel, a doctor told her she had a decision: She could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee. She chose the latter. \"It was probably the hardest decision I've had to make,\" she testified. Another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the Tsarnaev brothers' attack, Marc Fucarile, recounted the two bombs going off. \"I stepped back, and the next thing I remember was looking up at the sky,\" he testified, adding that he remembered \"a lot of yelling, a lot of screaming, people crying out for tourniquets.\" A nurse was sitting on his chest, and someone said, \"Oh, s***, he's on fire!\" He tried to undo his belt and got a third-degree burn because the buckle was so hot. A firefighter would later tell Fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter. He doesn't remember that. In addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body, doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit. He still gets blisters. \"So where the prosthetic attaches on your butt, it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds,\" he said. And though his left leg survived, it was severely burned, his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered, he said. He hopes to save the left leg, he testified, but it's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee. He takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning, 22 in afternoon, 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries, he said. One of the most dramatic points in Thursday's testimony involved the death of young Martin Richard. The prosecution showed close-up video of the 8-year-old, who was only 3½ feet from one of the bombs, according to the FBI's re-creation of the crime scene. His parents, Bill and Denise, are opposed to Tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase, though Bill Richard did testify during the guilt phase. Dr. King told the court that Martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground, meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso. It's highly unlikely the boy died instantly, King said. Explaining that Martin died of rapid blood loss, King testified, \"Receptors are generally not responsive to cutting. If you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver, it generally does not hurt. What hurts is the stretching and twisting. ... Intestines were pulled and twisted; that would have caused visceral type pain.\" Woolfenden, the biomedical researcher, recalled seeing Martin and his mother shortly after the good Samaritan took Woolfenden's son, Leo, to safety. \"I saw Martin's face, and I could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured,\" he said,. Martin's hair was singed, his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape. As for Martin's torso, \"I saw an immense amount of blood. I was really, really terrified,\" Woolfenden said. He recalled Denise Richard pleading with her son, saying, \"please\" and \"Martin\" over and over. Woolfenden placed his hand on Denise Richard's back, he said. She turned to ask Woolfenden if he was OK. He said he was, and she turned her attention back to Martin. But no response came. According to testimony, Martin's aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast. He bled to death on the sidewalk, and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs. CNN's Patrick Cornell contributed to this report.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Survivors and family members from the Boston Marathon bombing continue to provide powerful testimony during the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the surviving member of the two brothers who perpetrated the attack.

The 42-year-old actress and star of the hit TV sitcom \"Modern Family\" split from businessman Nick Loeb in May 2014. Loeb is suing the Colombian-born actress in Los Angeles to prevent Vergara from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in November 2013, according to published reports by New York Daily News and In Touch magazine. The lawsuit cited by the two publications, however, lists the plaintiff as \"Joe Doe\" and the defendant as \"Jane Doe.\" The suit doesn't identify the names of the actual litigants. Instead, the suit asks the court to advance the matter anonymously to protect the two individuals' privacy. The two publications cited unidentified sources in their reports. On Tuesday, Loeb's attorney Abram Moore confirmed in a statement that Loeb filed the lawsuit. Representatives for Vergara declined to comment. Court papers allege the couple created the embryos while they were engaged, and their plan was to eventually have children together. On \"Modern Family,\" Vergara plays Gloria Delgado Pritchett, an eccentric and voluptuous Colombian immigrant who in recent episodes had a baby. But the sitcom make-believe is far from what Vergara is dealing with now. The lawsuit states the embryos should not be destroyed under any circumstances by Jane Doe until both parties reach an agreement. The suit also names as a defendant the clinic where the embryos are being held, the Art Reproductive Center in Beverly Hills. The center didn't respond to a message seeking comment Friday. According to the legal paperwork, the ex-couple had already used two surrogate mothers, one being a close friend of Jane Doe's, in an attempt to have children. However, neither of the implantations was successful. In his own statement, Loeb said he wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term, but he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. His statement doesn't directly identify Vergara as the donor, other than referring to his \"ex.\" \"I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind,\" Loeb said. He believes that \"life begins at fertilization,\" he said. \"Creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations, even where a man doesn't want to become a father. Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right.  However life comes to be created, it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent,\" Loeb said. In an interview with ABC in April 2013, while the couple was still engaged, Vergara spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it. \"We just wanted to plan ahead. My boyfriend Nick is three years younger than me and he's never had a son. I have my son, Manolo, so it's not that import(ant)... you know, it's not like an emergency for me to have another kid. For Nick, yes, because he's never had a baby,\" Vergara said. During the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with Loeb. \"I already froze some eggs so, you know, I wanted to take advantage of science. Why not?\" Vergara said. The ABC anchor asked Vergara how far along she was in the process, to which the actress replied: \"I took them out already. They're in a refrigerator.\" Laughing, she added, \"Hopefully they'll be fresh by the time I use them.\" The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. \"Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,\" he said. In most cases, the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney, although anyone can make a request, Tourgeman said. If there's a disagreement, the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos, he said. \"The documents that were signed during the fertility process will probably only apply in the case of death of one of the partners,\" he said. \"In the scenario where there's a disagreement as to who these embryos belong to, it will usually be decided by a court of law.\" But experts say this lawsuit is bringing up a lot of interesting issues. \"Religious, moral issues, to legal and contract issues. When does life begin? Are these embryos alive?\" said California attorney Vance Owen. \"To Catholics, for example, conception marks the beginning of life. To abortion advocates, the child has to be in a more advanced state, perhaps the third trimester, so it's a very interesting time to be discussing these life issues,\" Owen said. Owen said Loeb has a case because no court in California will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree. \"This case is a gray area of law because it's new,\" Owen said. \"It's developing as we speak,\" he said. \"It's a question, I think, of whether to decide if these frozen (embryos)are human beings or whether they are property. Since they are unborn, some states in the United States look at these (embryos) not as life, but as property.\" Owen said the lawsuit reportedly filed by Loeb will now open new issues, and a California court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong. \"These embryos are not inside her body,\" he said. \"They are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in Beverly Hills, so there the Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri vs. Danforth case cannot be used by the Sofia Vergara team to allege that the (embryos) would present some danger to her health as they did in that case.\" In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional. The lawsuit comes as Vergara promotes her new movie, \"Hot Pursuit,\" with co-star Reese Witherspoon. Vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello.

Loeb is suing Vergara to prevent her from destroying the embryos, which are currently being held at a clinic in Beverly Hills. The lawsuit, which names the couple as \"Jane Doe\" and \"John Doe,\" requests that the court allow Loeb to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term. Loeb believes that \"life begins at fertilization\" and that he has a corresponding right to be a father since he wants to bring the embryos to term.

After their May 2014 split, Loeb filed a lawsuit to prevent Vergara from destroying the embryos. The lawsuit, initially filed anonymously as \"Joe Doe\" vs. \"Jane Doe,\" states the embryos should not be destroyed until both parties reach an agreement.\n\nLoeb wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate, claiming he believes \"life begins at fertilization\" and has offered to waive Vergara's parental and financial responsibilities. Vergara had previously mentioned in a 2013 ABC interview that she froze eggs because Loeb, who is three years younger, had never had a child.\n\nThe case raises complex questions about embryo ownership rights.

But this man of the house is actually a woman. The grandmother of two has dressed as a man for 43 years to avoid oppression and eek out a living in the conservative Muslim state. \"Why did you do this mother?\" her daughter asked during a recorded interview with Egyptian television network CBC. \"Your father died and I was six months pregnant with you.\" she replied. \"None of my siblings helped me. I raised you and sent you to school. Without money I could not have gotten you an education.\" A widow at just 21, Dahou was forced to fend for herself in Egypt's patriarchal south, where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living. Even in recent years, women make up barely 24% of Egypt's workforce, according to the World Bank. \"It is considered wrong that I dressed as a man but no one can judge. Not you or anyone else. Only God can judge me,\" Dahou said, \"People talked but I said I decided to be a man so I can take care of my small daughter.\" The breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters, the equivalent of a few cents, until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit.  She found a place for her wooden box, painted with red hearts and the Egyptian flag, alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community. \"If it wasn't for my mother, I would have been on the streets\" Houda, her daughter, told TV host Mona al-Shazly through tears. \"Honestly I would have been in the streets. I did not find a home except with my mother. And even today my children rely on her.\" The years of sun and sand weathered and darkened Dahou's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man. Her only child, Houda, eventually married and had two children of her own. Through the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day, a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes.  After her interview on CBC television, the governor of Luxor province offered Dahou a kiosk and a cash advance. The maverick had one requirement- she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire. \"Even if I die, I will not take it off,\" Dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a TV camera, \"When I had to dress in a woman's jalabiya when I went to Cairo I felt suffocated. No, I thank God. I don't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter.\" Now the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman. Egypt's President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, crowned her as one of Egypt's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month. \"If I was really a man, I would not have done this,\" Dahou told her daughter, \"I would have gotten remarried. I would have left you who knows where. You would have been treated without dignity or left homeless. Thank God I was able to protect you.\"\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"In a male-dominated society, Sissa Abu Dahou, a 65-year-old grandmother from Luxor, Egypt, has dressed as a man for 43 years to avoid oppression and make a living.

Since late January, their work in the Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez had consumed their lives. It was nothing like \"Law & Order.\" The days were long and tedious. Now it was over. \"It's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us,\" Lesa Strachan told CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury. A day earlier, Strachan, the jury foreperson, announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of Hernandez's onetime friend Odin Lloyd. Strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots. \"You shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times. There's no need for that and there's no need to use a gun. Period.\" Before the trial, at least one juror -- Rosalie Oliver -- hadn't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison. But Kelly Dorsey watches the Patriots every Sunday during the football season. She said so on her jury questionnaire. \"I knew of him as a football player, not a person,\" she said. It didn't affect her vote to convict, she said. It didn't matter that he was a football player, she said. Nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder. \"To leave your friend on the ground, knowing that he's not there anymore -- he's either dead or he's going to die -- that's indifference,\" Dorsey said of Hernandez. \"He didn't need to pull the trigger.\" That word -- \"indifference\" -- was used multiple times by members of the jury. Jon Carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that Hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying, drinking smoothies. Hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men. That indifference \"surprised a lot of us,\" Carlson said. He stressed the fact that Hernandez played football for a living didn't influence the jury's decision. \"It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much money you make. We're all people, and we're all equal, and we all deserve the same fair trial, and that's what we wanted to make sure we gave him,\" Carlson said. Lloyd was seen June 17, 2013, around 2:30 a.m. with Hernandez and Hernandez's friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Later that day, a jogger found his body. He had been shot six times, according to prosecutors. Wallace and Ortiz, who were also charged with murder, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. What's next for Aaron Hernandez? Rosalie Oliver -- the juror who hadn't heard of Hernandez before the trial -- said that, for her, the first shot was enough. \"There was no need for the other five,\" she said. \"One shot for me is cruelty.\" Oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict. \"Who won?\" she asked \"Odin Lloyd didn't win. (His mother) didn't bring back her son. Did Mr. Hernandez win? No, because he's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he's 25 years old. The worst part for me is: How about that little girl that's never going to see her father again?\" What prison life will be like for Aaron Hernandez. Oliver recalled making eye contact with Hernandez at one point during the months-long trial. \"He actually nodded to me one time,\" she said. \"You come in that room every day and you see this person and it's hard to come to that decision at the end because -- like three months with them -- it's almost like they're part of you. And then, all of a sudden now, you've got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go.\" The jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room, choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial. They conveyed a sense of gravity about their task. \"You see, you know, 'Law & Order' and all these different TV shows and it's just nothing like that at all.

Minutes later, Johnson says, the attendant announced there was a pressurization problem and told passengers to prepare for the emergency landing. \"You're going to feel dizzy and woozy and lightheaded, and you're not going to be able to breathe,\" Johnson recalled the flight attendant saying. The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday initially reported a pressurization problem with SkyWest Flight 5622, and said it would investigate. It later issued a statement that did not reference any pressurization issues. \"It was like being trapped and you couldn't do anything. You have no control over it. Your body just felt pressured,\" Johnson said. Johnson said his girlfriend was seeing spots and that \"when I was blinking, it was really bright. I could barely see.\" According to Marissa Snow, spokeswoman for SkyWest, three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight. Fifteen passengers were examined by medical personnel at the Buffalo airport, but no one was transported to the hospital, she said. The spokeswoman said that maintenance personnel found no indication of a pressurization problem with the aircraft, an Embraer E170, and that the airline continues to investigate the cause. An official with the National Transportation Safety Board told CNN that the agency is in communication with the FAA and SkyWest to gather information on the incident to better understand what took place. Mary Cunningham was the nurse on board who attended to the first sick passenger. \"There was a woman, very lethargic, very nauseous, turning gray, just not looking good,\" Cunningham said. After administering oxygen to the woman, Cunningham, a nurse at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut, returned to her seat. Soon after, Cunningham said, she was called up again by the flight attendant after another women near the first started to lose consciousness. \"It was something that was affecting oxygen in that area,\" which was near the middle of the plane, she said. Cunningham said she had to return to her seat after feeling lightheaded. There were 84 passengers on board the plane, including nine crew members. Flight 5622 was originally scheduled to fly from Chicago to Hartford, Connecticut. The plane descended 28,000 feet in three minutes. \"It would feel like a roller coaster -- when you're coming over the top and you're going down,\" CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said, describing how such a descent would feel. \"You know that these pilots knew they were in a very grave and very serious situation.\" Johnson, flying to visit his parents with their only grandchild, was glad that roller coaster ride ended safely. \"It was a shaky ride. It wasn't anything I would like to experience again,\" he said.

To walk into court and show remorse, tell us that they are really nice people who only did it because they feared for their lives, or they were temporarily insane. Even though those things may not be true, too often they are accepted as legitimate excuses for murder. Well, Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end and now convicted murderer, made none of those excuses. He walked into court with an air of bravado, his head held high like the $40 million, NFL superstar he was just a couple of years ago. Several times he was even caught winking at his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, during the trial. And we didn't like his swagger. Hernandez didn't offer a plausible alibi. He didn't look ashamed or remorseful. He never wept. His own attorney, James Sultan, admitted that Hernandez \"witnessed\" the killing of Odin Lloyd, \"committed by somebody he knew,\" but said his client did not commit the crime. Even before the guilty verdict came down Wednesday, for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant's biggest crime. \"The Arrogance of Aaron Hernandez,\" a New Yorker headline accused. I don't get it. What does it matter that Hernandez was arrogant in court, or walked with too much swagger, or even smiled at his girl? Like it or not, that is who he is. The evidence is what matters. And for once, this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision: guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. He was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition. It was the right decision. Still, it's hard not to feel sadness over such a senseless waste of life for both Lloyd and now Hernandez, who were once friends. Football was the best thing Hernandez ever had, especially after he father died suddenly after a routine hernia surgery in 2006. Hernandez was 16. After that his life got complicated. At 17, Hernandez went off to the University of Florida and seemed headed for greatness. There he won the John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end and led the team in receiving during its 2009 Bowl Championship Series win. But off the field, his life was to beginning to unravel. Trouble started: bar fights, reports of marijuana use and failed drug tests. He was even questioned in relation to a shooting after a fight at a Gainesville, Florida, nightclub. By the time he was drafted in 2010 by the New England Patriots, Hernandez had already been labeled a \"troubled player.\" But neither the Patriots nor the NFL has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the Hernandez case. They did everything right this time. Hours after Hernandez was charged with murder, he was let go from the team. And his coaches didn't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent, family-loving guy, as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble. This time justice worked. There's no reason to second-guess what went wrong, to ask \"How could a star NFLer be a murderer?\" The NFL for the most part does a great job vetting its players, and certainly Hernandez is an anomaly in the league, where despite the ugly headlines, the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding, law-abiding citizens. And Patriots bashers (me included) would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting Hernandez despite his troubled past. No one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others, even those closest to us. Not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees, or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people, and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job. There was no way to predict Hernandez would end up a murderer. He was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world, but he still went wrong. Hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom:. According to a law enforcement source close to the case, Hernandez told officers escorting him, \"'Hey man, I'm going to miss you guys. ... I don't need any luck any more.' He gave you the impression, 'It's kinda like no big deal. ... It is what it is.' \"\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Former New England Patriots tight end, Aaron Hernandez, has been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole after being found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd.

Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. \"He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,\" Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday. That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. \"It took so long,\" Jordan said.  \"It moved so slowly.\" The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. \"He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,\" he said. Lost at sea for 66 days. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions. \"I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,\" Jordan said.  \"The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. \"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.\" Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jordan came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m. Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing. Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun. Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal. \"I know he went through what he went through,\" Frank Jordan said. Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. \"He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,\" Frank Jordan said. \"And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.\" Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land. \"You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him,\" he said. \"But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing.\" Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days. Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry. \"We took him to a rescue boat,\" the container ship captain said. \"He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again.\" Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named \"Angel.\" Morris said: \"It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat.\" Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away. \"There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there,\" Morris told the station. After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony. The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week.

Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that \"so far no videos were used in the crash investigation.\" He added, \"A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.\" Robin's comments follow claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps. All 150 on board were killed. Paris Match and Bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. \"One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages,\" Paris Match reported. \"Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing.\" \"It is a very disturbing scene,\" said Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Bild online. An official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the Germanwings crash site, told CNN that the reports were \"completely wrong\" and \"unwarranted.\" Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they \"hadn't been exploited yet.\" Menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the Criminal Research Institute in Rosny sous-Bois, near Paris, in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute, Menichini said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media, Menichini answered with a categorical \"no.\" Reichelt told \"Erin Burnett: Outfront\" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying Bild and Paris Match are \"very confident\" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports. \"That is something we did not know before. ... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning,\" he said. What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot? German airline Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525, which he's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps. Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a \"previous episode of severe depression,\" the airline said Tuesday. Email correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation, Lufthansa said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, knew of Lubitz's battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit. Lufthansa, whose CEO Carsten Spohr previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a \"swift and seamless clarification\" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors. Spohr traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center set up in Seyne-les-Alpes, laid a wreath in the village of Le Vernet, closer to the crash site, where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial. Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching. French President Francois Hollande, speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday, Menichini said. Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our correspondents. The details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet. A Lufthansa spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and \"held all the licenses required.\" Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf, Christoph Kumpa, said medical records reveal Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license. Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday. While flying was \"a big part of his life,\" the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the European government official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said Brian Russell, a forensic psychologist. \"Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal,\" he said. \"But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.\" Germanwings crash compensation: What we know.

Travolta told the Tampa Bay Times that he has not seen the documentary, \"and I don't really care to.\" \"I've been so happy with my (Scientology) experience in the last 40 years that I really don't have anything to say that would shed light on (a documentary) so decidedly negative,\" Travolta said.

The HBO documentary is based on the book \"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief\" by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization, which has close ties to the showbiz industry. Travolta said he believed the doc was a result of \"people who were disgruntled with their experiences\" with the Church of Scientology, which he touted as a positive experience for him. \"I haven't experienced anything that the hearsay has (claimed), so why would I communicate something that wasn't true for me?\" Travolta asked. \"It wouldn't make sense, nor would it for Tom (Cruise), I imagine.\" He called Scientology \"brilliant\" and credited the church with helping him to survive the death of his teen son, Jett, after a seizure while the family was on vacation in the Bahamas in 2009. \"Oh, my God, I wouldn't have made it,\" said Travolta, whose wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member. \"Honestly.\"\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"John Travolta, one of the Church of Scientology's most high-profile members, has expressed his disinterest in watching HBO's new critical documentary, \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\".

Merely a private. 13/7/16. SA Australia,\" reads one inscription. \"HA Deanate, 148th Aero Squadron, USA. 150 Vermilyea Ave, New York City,\" another says. \"9th Batt Australians, G. Fitzhenry, Paddington, Sydney, N.S.W., 1916 July; Alistair Ross, Lismore, July,\" reads a third. They were World War I soldiers, four of almost 2,000, whose writings have recently been found underneath battlefields near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has been chronicling details of the site, describes the inscriptions -- and the underground city in which they were found -- as \"breathtaking.\" \"This is a treasure trove,\" he said Monday night from his home in East Texas, where he works as an ER doctor. \"Even locally, no one realized what was there.\" Gusky, a National Geographic photographer, has chronicled the area in a portfolio he calls \"The Hidden World of WWI.\" The revelations of the underground city, which extends for miles in some directions, have come to light recently only because of a series of events, Gusky said. The underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century. It was rediscovered in the late 19th century. During World War I, soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways. The front was sometimes mere miles away; the Battle of the Somme, one of the bloodiest in world history, was fought nearby in 1916. The land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders, said Gusky, but it changed hands in 2013. The rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area's history, he said. Researching the city is a painstaking task. For one thing, it's dark, so observers generally haven't realized what's in there until they've gone exploring. Moreover, the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process. \"They go on and on and on. They're so elaborate in some places, there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers wouldn't get lost,\" he said. The graffiti looks like it was written yesterday, he added. Gusky has noted 1,821 names. About 40% are Australian, with most of the others identified as British. Fifty-five are Americans, and 662 have yet to be traced. For Gusky, the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago. In many cases, they just wanted to be remembered, he said. \"Someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front,\" he said. Leach, \"merely a private,\" was killed a month later in battle, Gusky observed. \"It could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living, breathing human being,\" he said. 7 things you didn't know about the man who started WWI.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Almost 2,000 inscriptions from World War I soldiers have been found in an underground city, located beneath battlefields near Naours, France.

The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students. That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called \"Jackie,\" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out. The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012, and Jackie told the university about it the next spring. She started telling her story very publicly, including at a \"take back the night\" rally. But Charlottesville police didn't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014, in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face. When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault, she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident. In both cases, police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case. But more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie's. Rolling Stone's story opened up a conversation about the topic, and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims. Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus. They'd call it a \"bad experience.\" Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being \"rapey\" and for using date-rape drugs. That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman's outfit. And if a woman did report her rape, some women complained that the internal process didn't seem worth it if their abuser wouldn't be kicked out of school. Rolling Stone had a line in its original story: \"UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault.\" After the article published, UVA admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined, so it's unclear what it means. When the story was deleted from Rolling Stone's website, that was lost. \"You lose a lot of other people's voices who were in that article,\" said Sarah Roderick, a survivor and UVA student, \"and a lot of good things that could have come about. Fixing problems with administration here and on our campus\" -- and, she added, across the nationo. Along with the O'Melveny & Myers investigation, there's also an open Title IX investigation into UVA by the U.S. Department of Education as a result of a civil suit. The attorney who filed the suit, James Marsh, told CNN that UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he's representing, making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice. When the Columbia Journalism School's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up, it really boils down to this: The mistake could have been avoided if the writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of Jackie who she claimed were with her that night. They'd later tell other media outlets, including CNN, that they remembered a very different story. Rolling Stone says their account would have been a red flag. And all three say they would have talked if they'd been called. Ryan Duffin, one of the trio, said he felt deceived by Jackie, but he also pointed out that Erdely's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident, and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost. \"Had she gotten in direct contact with us, it probably wouldn't have been printed, at least in that way,\" he said. \"A lot of the article was still based in truth, but the focal point would have been different.\" It might have been less dramatic, but it would have probably focused on some of the other UVA students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus. \"I think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that's not very common,\" Roderick said. \"... And I wonder if it would have been different if (it dealt) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people. I think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through. Something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through. Now it's like, 'If I wasn't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention.' It's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm.\" Before the report came out, Abraham Axler, the student body president, said that some good had come from the article because it forced UVA to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide. But some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress. \"I do feel like there's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward. If you come forward and share your story, if you don't have the date right, every detail down, you'll think, 'I'm going to be accused of being a liar. It's easier for me to keep it to myself,'\" Roderick said. \"There are very serious and unresolved questions about the university's performance,\" said Steve Coll, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. \"Rolling Stone teed that subject up. I wouldn't say that everything about Rolling Stone's treatment of that subject was perfect, but it certainly doesn't fall under the same category as their reporting about Jackie's narrative.\"\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The University of Virginia (UVA) is currently under investigation for how it handles sexual assault cases on campus.

These are only two of the 100 challenges Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about \"100 Days of Rejection\", a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30, just weeks before his first child was born. After his tech start-up was declined investment, Jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on. This led to his writing his book called Rejection Proof, part self-help and part motivational/autobiography, which is being released this week. Famously, in 2012 on his third day of the project, Jiang asked Austin, Texas, Krispy Kreme manager (Jackie Braun) to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the Olympic symbol. To his surprise, she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered. He shared his video and it went viral on Reddit. Before long, Jiang (and Braun) were invited on talk shows and Jiang was being asked to speak at events across the US. Jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew. That wasn't the goal of the project though. \"I'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears,\" explained Jiang. The project started out to help \"fix my own problems, and now I'm helping others fix theirs,\" he said. \"The fear of rejection really holds people back. I'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection.\" Jiang, who as a child dreamed of being Bill Gates and has been viewed 7 million times on YouTube, has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment. \"My goal is to turn rejection into opportunity. I always thought it was something to run away from, but if we can embrace it, we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle.\" 8 top tips in making rejection work for you:. 1 - The fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection. By putting ourselves out there, the world will usually open itself up to you. Though the world can seem cruel and cold, actually humans have a hard time saying no. So open yourself up, don't be afraid to ask for something. If you fail, remember it's not about you. 2 -  Rejection is more or less a numbers game. Sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes. If you talk to enough people, somebody will say yes to you. J.K. Rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 3 - You cannot use rejection to measure the merit of an idea. Sometimes if you really want to change the world, getting rejection is a must. Rejection is a human interaction with two sides. It often says more about the rejector than the rejectee, and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit. 4 - Don't run away after a no. The most common thing we do when we're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you're hurt, angry and you lose confidence. But actually if we know how to handle it, we can often minimize the chance of rejection. Be confident, engaging, collaborate. I used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes. 5 - Ask why? When you get rejected you have to find out why. Then spend time to find solutions to solve that why. Sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for. Ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position. 6 - Set a number of how many no's you can take. In his book, Jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at Google. He tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job, she needs to prepare herself for how many no's she can take.  In the end, she was offered a job at Google. 7 - Be invincible. By the end of his project, Jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection. It was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded. It's like a muscle, I could become stronger and stronger. 8 - Stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion. People are who they are. A lot of people will reject you because of their mood, their education, their upbringing, and you can't change who they are. But you can stand confidently. Innate confidence comes across.

More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the \"most severe public health emergency seen in modern times\" showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. \"Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks,\" the latest WHO report said.

What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. The public is losing confidence in law enforcement, and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As fear ratchets up, so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. They only help compensate for the real underlying problem, which is this: There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system, and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men. When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it. As a society, we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income, education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation. But social change, sadly, may take generations of hard work. In the meantime, if we can't immediately root out racial bias, we can at least put a bright spotlight on it, and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"A defence attorney writes that the video of Officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott in the back as he fled a police encounter haunts him.

The vast majority of the camp's occupants are from the town of Sinjar, which is near the border with Syrian Kurdistan, and fled the ISIS assault there back in August. But not everyone escaped. ISIS took thousands of Yazidis captive. The fighters separated the young women and girls, some as young as 8 years old, to be sold as slaves, for their \"masters\" to use as concubines. Men faced a choice: Convert to Islam or be shot. Mahmoud was out running errands when ISIS fighters arrived, taking his wife, Ahlam, their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents. \"They took our phones, jewelry, money,\" Ahlam recalls. \"They had guns. They forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks.\" They were taken to a school turned prison in Tal Afar. From there, the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to Mosul. \"They wrote everyone's name down and they asked where we want to work, in the fields, as cleaners or as herders,\" she says. Ahlam and her family chose to herd goats. They were then taken to a Shia village whose residents had fled, where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house. In the home, Ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband. \"I said we are alive but we are prisoners.\" Ahlam's husband, who up until that moment had lost the will to live, thinking his family was dead, says he cried out of happiness despite his pain. Ahlam would call when she could, briefly, after midnight, hiding under her bedcovers. If she was caught with a phone, she would be killed. The village itself was a massive prison, its entrances guarded by ISIS fighters. She recalls that two men, in their late 40s or 50s, tried to escape. When they were caught, their bones were broken, their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets. The Yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle. The men's corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them. One night, some of the Yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies, to give those slain what dignity they could. Ahlam tells us that about a week before we met, ISIS fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house. \"We didn't know where they were taking them, we thought we would be next,\" she remembers. So she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee. \"We decided that either we survive or we don't.\" They left at midnight. Ahlam cradled the baby, as her two other children, ages 3 and 4 years old, clutched at her clothes. She prayed the baby wouldn't cry, that the children could keep walking. They knew the general direction to take, but not the exact route, and they could only hope it was toward freedom. \"When the sun started to come up, I thought that's it, we are going to get caught,\" Ahlam says. \"And what am I going to do with the kids?  I can't carry all three of them and run.\" Luckily, Ahlam never had to answer that impossible question. The group made it into Iraqi Kurdistan. The couple can't put into words their emotions when they were reunited. Mahmoud, gently caressing his daughter's palm, says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with, and their three children, were by his side again. It had been eight agonizing months. But their joy was tainted by fear for Mahmoud's parents. A few days after Mahmoud and Ahlam were reunited, ISIS released 217 captives. No one is disclosing exactly why. Among them were 60 children, a handful of men and women, and the rest were elderly -- including Mahmoud's parents. \"We didn't know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us,\" Mahmoud's father says. \"They moved us around a lot, and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days.\" But Ahlam's parents are still with ISIS. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, speculates that the Yazidis ISIS released are individuals they were struggling to care for. Dakhil is part of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's delegation to the United States this week. She will be addressing the United Nations -- pleading for more international support for Iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat ISIS -- and she will address the plight of the Yazidis. \"We sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred. This would be better than being kidnapped and raped. We prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women,\" Dakhil says. \"It is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this. How to get these captives back. It's inconceivable that in the 21st century, something like this is happening as if we were living in the Stone Age.\" Ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children, which, we're told, makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave. For Ahlam, what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal. It's the moment when the ISIS fighters began taking away the girls and young women. She's haunted by their screams, the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"A Yazidi family managed to escape from ISIS after being held captive for eight months.

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family was airlifted to hospitals in the United States. The boys, 16 and 14, were in critical condition at a Philadelphia hospital on Saturday, the family's lawyer, James Maron of Delaware, said. \"The boys are in rough shape,\" Maron said. \"The family are all fighters,\" he added. \"They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery.\" Esmond, also being treated at a hospital, is conscious but cannot move, Maron said. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital but released, and is now in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family began had been renting since March 14. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results \"do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying.\" Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. \"It's an ongoing investigation; we're still on the island doing our assessment,\" Rodriguez said. \"We have been doing different types of air sampling and wipe sampling.\" Final test results were expected next week. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Maron, the family's attorney, declined to comment on the investigation. Depending on the season, the luxury villa where the family stayed rents between $550 and $1,200 per night. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but their unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. \"Sea Glass Vacations does not treat the units it manages for pests but instead relies on licensed professionals for pest control services,\" the company said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made Monday by ServiceMaster Global Holdings, the parent company of Terminix. In an email to CNN, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" \"We're thinking about the family, and we join the community in wishing them a speedy recovery,\" Terminix wrote.

On Monday, the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy, stating that \"such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers.\" This bolsters the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term \"drug\" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases. The group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection, said Michelle Spinnler, spokeswoman for the American Pharmacists Association. That spotlight includes a January Supreme Court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in Oklahoma. This was prompted by Clayton Lockett's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack. In Georgia last month, the execution of female death row inmate Kelly Renee Gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy. Thirty-two sates allow capital punishment, and lethal injection is still the most common method. Last month, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available. Of the eight inmates currently on death row in Utah, three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad. Pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection. In Texas, the department of criminal justice told CNN in March they are running out of their supply. In July 2011, Lundbeck Inc., the manufacturer of pentobarbital, decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment. The companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose, so states then turned to compounded preparations, Spinnler said. \"Pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way.\" she says. The new declaration by the American Pharmacists Association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The American Pharmacists Association has banned its members from participating in executions, stating that it is contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers.

There are those who believe that mankind's activities are changing the planet's climate, and those who don't. But a new way to talk about climate change is emerging, which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one: your health. It's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations, but who wouldn't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health, or the health of their children? This new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion Tuesday at Howard University's College of Medicine. President Barack Obama joined U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of National Public Health Week. \"I think we've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health,\" the President told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"I remember when I first went to college in Los Angeles in 1979, the air was so bad that you couldn't go running outside,\" Obama said. \"You'd have air quality alerts, and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside. We took action, and the air's a lot better.\" \"There are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home, so we've got to do better in protecting vulnerable Americans,\" Obama continued. \"Ultimately, though, all of our families are going to be vulnerable. You can't cordon yourself off from air or climate.\" Murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him, as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger. \"It's also personal to me because I've cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath,\" Murthy said.  \"Asthma can be very difficult for patients, but also for their families. The impacts of climate change could make the situation worse.\" \"This is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat,\" said Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President. Deese cited a recent study by the American Thoracic Society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. \"The good news is that, in addition to having doctors and nurses, public health officials, schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate, for example, increased asthma instances, and plan ahead of time to deal with those,\" Obama told Gupta. \"What we have is companies like Google and Microsoft that are going to take data we're releasing and start developing apps so that, potentially, individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis.\" \"Communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively, and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change,\" said Obama. The impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. \"These factors include the effectiveness of a community's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior, age, gender, and economic status of individuals affected,\" the EPA says on its website. \"Impacts will likely vary by region, the sensitivity of populations, the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts, and society's ability to adapt to change.\" The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050. \"Most will likely perish from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure and under-nutrition.\" \"Around the world, variations in climate are affecting, in profoundly diverse ways, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink,\" writes Dr. Maria Neira, director of the WHO's public health and environment department. \"We are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health.\" \"Consider air pollution, the single greatest environmental health risk we face. In 2012 alone, exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide. Under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world's poorest regions. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields, further compromising food security. Floods are increasing in frequency and intensity, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria, are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity. What will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite?\" \"Children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable,\" writes Neira. \"Areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope. Developing countries will be hardest hit. The health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider.\" Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century, and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years, according to the EPA. \"Small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather,\" the agency warns. \"Many places have seen changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves.\" Still, there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening. \"Although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather, Americans are no more likely today (55%) than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring,\" according to a March Gallup poll. A 2013 TIME magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming. \"Framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people, since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people's lives,\" the article says. \"This strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided, if action is taken early enough.\" The President said what happened with Los Angeles' air proved that point. \"When the Clean Air Act was passed, not only was there a terrible smog in Los Angeles, it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country,\" Obama said. \"The fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it's been much cheaper than anybody expected, because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it. As a consequence, the American people are a lot healthier, in addition to being able to, you know, see the mountains in the background because it's not covered in smog.\" \"We know how to do this,\" Obama said. \"We just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the American people have always displayed.\"\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"A new approach to talking about climate change, which links it to public health issues, was part of a roundtable discussion at Howard University's College of Medicine.

That's what happened to cyclist Wang Pingan as he neared the end of a two-wheel trek that covered thousands of miles through every major province in the vast country, according to local media. Arriving in the southern city of Shenzhen, in southern Guandong province, Wang locked up his trusty mountain bike, loaded with panniers, to check out electronics markets in the city's Huaqiangbei area. Within 10 minutes the thieves struck. But here's where the story takes an unexpected turn. Despite police initially saying odds were stacked against the bike ever being recovered, Shenzhen's finest managed to track it down and return it. The Southern Metro News reported that police apprehended an alleged criminal and sent Wang a photo of a bike they recovered. He recognized it instantly. They said the theft, from a road junction \"infested\" by cycle thieves was caught on surveillance cameras. The bike had likely been sold twice before being recovered. \"We don't want this lad visiting Shenzhen and having a bad memory of the city,\" a police spokesman told the paper. Now, with 29,200 kilometers under his tires, Wang can continue the final few days of his epic journey. He'll be able to add his final destination, Hainan Island, to a route that has already taken in some of the country's most far-flung places. Among them are Mohe in Heilongjiang, China's northernmost and coldest place, Urumqi in the west and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the southwest.. Wang, a recent university graduate, who embarked on his trip with a budget of little more than $100, had earlier turned down offers from across China to help him get a new bike, vowing to walk if he couldn't be reunited with his \"old lover.\" \"It has a special meaning to me,\" he said, according to SMN. Before the bike's recovery, Wang had posted a heart-rending tribute to his bike on social media, recalling their adventures together. \"The bicycle itself doesn't have a high value, but spending more than a year with it, it's like a best friend who has accompanied me on my way, and taken me to every place without complaints,\" he writes. \"Thank you, my buddy, maybe I'll never see you again ...

Eritreans want to escape repression or military service; Somalis flee Al-Shabaab and clan warfare; Syrians have given up hope of returning home. In villages in Senegal and elsewhere across West Africa, young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in Europe, perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it. Motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the Mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved, according to researchers and human rights groups. But in 2014 more than 80% of them headed for the Libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation. From the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic, from Syria and Gaza, these would-be migrants travel well-established smuggling routes. Along the way they must cross deserts and mountains, risk kidnap or robbery, are often cheated or left stranded. One African migrant reported surviving on toothpaste for days. A teenage Somali who made it to Malta told researchers that he had warned other family members not to come. \"I tell them its 95% sure that you will die,\" he said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has tracked the migrant flows through North Africa for years. Eritreans have long been prominent among the travelers, escaping an authoritarian government, poverty and indefinite military service -- a land without possibilities. \"Many conscripts are not demobilized from the military as scheduled and some were forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention, torture, or punishment of their families,\" according to a report by the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat (RMMS) in Nairobi last year. They travel to Sudan, so long as they can avoid kidnap by tribes on the border, and are handed from one group of smugglers to the next in relay. One Eritrean woman told the UN Refugee agency (UNHCR) this month that she had paid $5,000 to reach the Mediterranean. Eritreans and Syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to Europe last year, according to Arezo Malakooti, director of migration research at Altai Consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns. Malakooti has recently visited seven countries, including Libya, Tunisia and Morocco to update her study. The \"push factor\" is much greater than the \"pull\" of Europe, she says. Upheavals and instability across much of Africa and the Middle East -- combined with the perception that Libya's doors are open -- have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach Libya. \"Worsening repression in Eritrea\" has been one factor, she says -- while Eritreans already in refugee camps in Sudan have decided to make a dash for the Mediterranean. One reason is that other routes -- through Saudi Arabia and to Israel -- have become more difficult: Israel has adopted a much tougher approach on would-be Eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the Sinai desert, including detention, and Yemen's implosion has cut off that conduit. As one Eritrean told the humanitarian journal IRIN last year: \"People were traveling to Israel because it was the only way, and now they're traveling to Europe because it's the only way.\" Somalis, often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the Mediterranean, face a perfect storm of crises. \"Extreme poverty; prolonged insecurity; sexual violence and other serious human rights violations; lack of access to basic needs such as food, medical services, healthcare and livelihoods\" are all contributory factors, says the RMMS. Sea-tossed storm of human misery hits Italian shores. The IOM told CNN it is seeing a spike in would-be migrants from Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Gambia in West Africa. Many reason that Libya's chaos is an opportunity: border posts are left abandoned, the coastline unguarded. Most West Africans make the journey for economic reasons; the majority are single men in their twenties. Populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking. Often, say researchers, the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home -- perhaps misled by fables of riches. Malakooti noted in a recent report that \"unrealistic expectations of their migration is fueled by migrants in destination who rarely send negative news home because of the pressure on them to succeed.\" But West Africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home: 400 Senegalese were recently repatriated from Libya by the Red Cross and IOM. Malians have the added incentive of the recent conflict in which jihadist groups seized nearly half the country before French-led intervention pushed them back. Joel Millman of the IOM says there's also been an increase in the number of Nigerian Christians following this route, escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by Boko Haram. Another disturbing phenomenon, according to Malakooti, is the trafficking of African women for prostitution to Italy through Libya. While still a small fraction of the overall migration, the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in Europe rose threefold in 2014, she says. Why migrants are risking their lives to reach Italy. A Geneva-based group, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, estimated last year that about half of West African migrants pass through the town of Agadez in northern Niger. A crackdown in 2013 on organized convoys leaving Agadez stemmed the flow for a while, but gangs from the Toubou tribe, which controls the cross-border trade, developed new routes and raised their prices. A migrant might pay as much as $300 to reach southern Libya in a truck or pick-up, according to researchers. Reliable figures on the numbers passing through Agadez are difficult to come by, but the consensus among experts is somewhere between 2,000 and 7,000 every month. Other hubs include Khartoum in Sudan, a way-station for migrants from East Africa, and Tamanrasset in southern Algeria, where a fake Malian passport aids passage. Algeria has also been a destination for Syrian refugees, but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes -- often through Turkey and the Greek islands. Hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in Libya for years, attracted to jobs as day laborers when Moammar Gadhafi was in power. Now they face violence, discrimination and religious persecution -- and are unable even to remit home what little they earn. So at least some are embarking on a journey to Europe they never intended to take. Malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach Europe. The recent murder of Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians by ISIS's Libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some. A similar dynamic applies to Syrian refugees. \"Initially, they remained in Lebanon, Jordan and other neighboring countries to wait out the conflict,\" says Malakooti. Now they've given up, or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated -- and have decided to try to reach Europe and start over. Within Libya, the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks, according to human rights organizations. They cluster in dusty towns such as Sabha and Qatrun and use what are known as 'connection houses.' How is Europe going to tackle migrant crisis. Those driving migrants to Tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast. Such a journey, across the desert to avoid checkpoints, might cost a migrant $200: in a failed state that sort of cash quickly generates armed rivalries. Tribal feuds, roaming militias and criminal gangs mean migrants need the skills of a smuggler. The arrival of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Libya has further complicated passage; in January jihadists killed 14 Libyan soldiers near Sabha. Malakooti detects a changing pattern since the Syrian conflict began. It has injected more money into the smuggling business, which has therefore become more organized. The more reliable groups can charge more; she says some migrants buy a \"package\" from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel. Syrian migrants are relatively better off than West Africans, and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel. Africans are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks, or consigned to an inflatable dinghy. Fearing arrest, the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves, instead giving a compass or GPS device to the migrants, who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port. As Libya becomes more dangerous for migrants, other countries on both sides of the Mediterranean are looking on anxiously. Some West Africans opt to travel through Morocco -- even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to Spain very difficult. \"A migrant might need 50 or 60 attempts before making it to the Spanish coast,\" says Malakooti. Tunisia has massively increased security along its eastern border with Libya; both Algeria and Morocco have begun building fences along their border -- against both terrorism and clandestine migration. But they may be little deterrent. The Eritrean writer Abu Bakr Khaal made the desperate voyage to and across the Mediterranean himself. In his novel \"African Titanics,\" he describes the \"dangerous lure\" of escape. Only too late do the migrants discover a grim reality at sea:. \"'If God loved me he would not have brought me here,' groaned one of the passengers. Assured he had uttered the most fitting farewell to life, he threw himself into the sea. The boat moved forward at the whim of the waves.\" Meet the couple on a mission to save drowning migrants.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"In 2014, more than 80% of the tens of thousands of migrants from over 20 countries headed for the Libyan coast as an embarkation point to Europe.

Everyone from Apple CEO Tim Cook to the head of the NCAA slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from Walmart, the ubiquitous retailer that dots the American landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent Republicans are urging the party to take notice. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who famously called on the GOP to \"be the party of Sam's Club, not just the country club,\" told CNN that Walmart's actions \"foreshadow where the Republican Party will need to move.\" \"The Republican Party will have to better stand for\" ideas on helping the middle class, said Pawlenty, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a Washington lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be \"willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians.\" Walmart, which employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called on Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed. Walmart's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the Republican Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the Walmart PAC gave around $2 million to Republicans versus less than $500,000 to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support Republicans and around $970,000 for Democrats. It has been a gradual transformation for Walmart. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say Walmart's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll). \"It's easy for someone like a Chick-fil-A to take a really polarizing position,\" said Dwight Hill, a partner at the retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle. \"But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different.\" Hill added: Same-sex marriage, \"while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within the U.S., and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer.\" The backlash over the religious freedom measures in Indiana and Arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality. After Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state. The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including Bill Oesterle, CEO of the business-rating website Angie's List and a one-time campaign manager for former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels. Oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in Indianapolis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act. NASCAR, scheduled to hold a race in Indianapolis this summer, also spoke out against the Indiana law. \"What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business,\" said Jason Rahlan, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. The debate has reached presidential politics. National Republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush initially backed Indiana's religious freedom law and Pence, but moderated his tone a few days later. The former Florida governor said Wednesday that Indiana could have taken a \"better\" and \"more consensus-oriented approach.\" \"By the end of the week, Indiana will be in the right place,\" Bush said, a reference to Pence's promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the GOP field are digging in. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the only officially declared Republican presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing Pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. \"I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda,\" Cruz said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who previously served on Walmart's board of directors, called on Hutchinson to veto the Arkansas bill, saying it would \"permit unfair discrimination\" against the LGBT community. Jay Chesshir, CEO of the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce in Arkansas, welcomed Hutchinson's pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. \"When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,\" Chesshir said. \"Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly.\"\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"As several US states consider religious freedom laws, which opponents suggest may open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers, Walmart has emerged as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on this contentious issue.

It celebrates the completion of Christ's mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection. By dying on Good Friday, Christ atoned for the sins of others; by rising from the grave on Sunday, Christ conquered death. Simple enough and reason for Christians to celebrate. But, like Christmas with its tree, ornaments and Santa Claus, Easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs.  Unlike Christmas, it doesn't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events. And that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around Easter? (No.) Here's a journey from the Vatican to the Holy Land, around the moon and the Earth's tilting axis, to Germany and the United States to try to explain the complex holiday called Easter. And you'll learn to how to color Easter eggs with Kool-Aid. Let's start at the Vatican. At the Vatican, Holy Week began with Palm Sunday last week and culminated in Easter Sunday Mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of Christ's mortal life. Jesus rode on the back of a donkey into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday where crowds celebrated him as the Messiah and laid down palm branches in his path. But the crowd and the Romans turned on him in the course of the week, according to the Bible, leading to his crucifixion and resurrection. Rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray St. Peter's Square on Sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by Pope Francis. Afterward, the Pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his Urbi et Orbi address. Francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe. From Nigeria to South Sudan, Iraq to Ukraine, he expressed hope that violence would end. Francis also doesn't put on airs. This week he washed the feet of believers, repeating the Biblical account of a woman, a sinner, washing Jesus' feet and anointing them with oil. Let's move on to old Jerusalem, the birthplace of Easter. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in old Jerusalem unifies the spot where Christ was crucified -- Calvary -- with his tomb, or sepulcher. On Sunday, Catholics and Armenian Christians celebrated the Resurrection there. In the morning, the Latin Patriarch, the Archbishop of Jerusalem, entered the basilica. Then mass was held followed by a procession. But a large group of indigenous Christians didn't join them. It's not quite Easter yet in the Holy Land for Eastern Orthodox Christians. They'll be celebrating a week from now, because they determine Easter's date by a different calendar than Western Christians -- the Julian calendar. Which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of Easter Sunday. A blood moon appeared in the sky early Saturday, right between Good Friday and Easter Sunday and during Passover. Just a coincidence? Not completely, because the dates for both Passover -- the Jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in Egypt -- and Easter are determined by moon phases, according to timeanddate.com. Easter's timing is related to Passover, because Jesus was crucified around then, according to the Bible. Many Jewish holidays, including Passover, fall on full moon, which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse, the event that turns the moon a blood red color. Since the timing of moon phases doesn't jibe with Earth's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- Passover's exact date moves around -- and so does Easter's. When Christian bishops first convened at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325, they made a rule to determine the date of Easter, so as to fairly reliably pin it to Passover:. It would fall on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. That's the day in March when Earth's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length. But ... if the full moon fell on Sunday, Easter would be pushed down a week. Confusing? It got worse. When the West moved from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, Orthodox Christians stayed put, resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for Easter. In 1997, the World Council of Churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences. It didn't catch on. But some odd Easter trappings that popped up after the Middle Ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny. The bunny is an egg-laying pagan that worships the moon. That's one notion of its origins, but probably not the actual one. German immigrants appear to have brought it to North America in the 1700s. German historians are not clear on its beginnings, but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682. Professor of medicine Georg Franck von Frankenau described in his paper \"De ovis paschalibus,\" or \"On Easter eggs,\" a custom in the Alsace region involving a bunny and eggs, according to German public television. Some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the Christmas tree. But von Frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose, leading to a number of theories in Germany. One common idea: During Lent, people had to abstain from eating eggs, but hens kept on laying them, so farmers boiled and preserved them. By the time Easter rolled around, they were practically swimming in them. They had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit. Play hide and seek with them; color them; give them as gifts. Parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the Easter eggs came from. If you're coloring eggs this year, here's an interesting tip.  Instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar, use Kool-Aid, YouTube science geek Grant Thompson suggests. And it appears to work. Just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in. They turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye. But be careful, it stains everything else, like clothes and upholstery, Thompson warns. That's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it. Happy Easter! Happy Passover!\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Easter, a cornerstone event in Christianity celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is surrounded by interesting quirks.

However, the summary introduces a problematic claim regarding the Easter bunny. It states that the tradition “likely originated in Germany in the 1700s and was brought to North America by German immigrants.” The source, however, explains that while German immigrants brought the bunny to North America in the 1700s, the article does not claim that the tradition originated in Germany during that period. In fact, the source mentions a different, less certain pagan origin for the bunny and does not tie its beginning specifically to 1700s Germany.

Luckily, Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government's top military official earnestly revealed that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet, Japan's parliament, that his jets had, to date, never come across any UFOs from outer space. \"When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country's airspace, it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation,\" Nakatani said. He continued: \"They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I don't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth.\" Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as \"among the most respected men in sports-entertainment\" -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization. He entered Japan's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013. He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976, in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches, which would later pave the way for today's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests. Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products, from hot sauce to banks. The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages, and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman's \"basketball diplomacy\" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea. He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s, although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism. The lawmaker, who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements, had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats, and if research was being done into alien visitors, prompting Nakatani's response. Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes, but admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. The exchange wasn't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet. In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications, under Japan's pacifist constitution, of a defense against an invasion from outer space.

At a ceremony honoring her life on the school's campus Friday afternoon, head coach Dan Benjamin said the toughest thing a coach has to deal with is a loss. The community had lost more than a player, he said. It lost a friend and a daughter. And it lost \"an unselfish angel.\" \"It's not often you get to celebrate a loss,\" he told the crowd as he struggled to hold in his tears. \"But today we celebrate a victory on how to live a life, through Lauren Hill. (No.) 22 you will be missed and remembered by so many.\" An assistant coach read a quote from Hill:. \"I encourage everyone to cherish every moment with no worry about the past or anxiety about the future. Because the next moment is never promised. Never leave anything unsaid. I have learned to see the blessings in every moment and through every struggle, no matter how tough it might be. Nothing holds me back from living my life and chasing my dreams. I always finish what I start and see it through to the end. Never give up on your dreams. Find something to fight for; I fight for others.\" Hill would go on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now.

While many regarded his voice as the soundtrack to an Australian summer, Benaud was equally revered by the cricketing public on the other side of the world where he spent more than four decades with the BBC taking the game into millions of British living rooms. But whether you were sitting in Sydney or in South London, there were plenty of \"marvelous\" Richie moments from the box to savor:. \"And Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.\" \"From our broadcasting box you can't see any grass at all. It is simply a carpet of humanity.\" \"Captaincy is 90% luck and 10% skill. But don't try it without that 10%.\" News of his passing quickly generated a wave of condolences, including from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. \"To most Australians Richie Benaud was cricket. He personified its traditions and its values,\" Abbott said in a written statement Friday. \"While many Australians only know Richard Benaud as the voice of cricket, we should not forget that in his day he was a cricketer with few equals.

Current Australian captain Michael Clarke posted an image of Benaud on Instagram with the message: \"What a man. Extremely sad day. You were a lot more then just a cricketer Richie. RIP.\" Clarke's former teammate Shane Warne also took to Instagram to post a touching letter to the late commentator. He wrote: \"Dear Richie, I've known you & Daphne for close to 30 years & to everyone you were a legend on all levels & rightly so too. \"As a cricketer, commentator & as a person, you were the best there's ever been & to top it off, an absolute gentleman...

He was so popular that many humorists strove to imitate him, so distinctive that none ever quite got him right.\" The BBC's cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew agreed. \"He was quite simply peerless. Nobody else had his authority, popularity and skill,\" Agnew said in a column on the BBC website. \"If you speak to any broadcaster from any sport, they will point to Richie as the standard-bearer.\" Australian national team coach Darren Lehmann said Benaud set \"an incredibly high standard on and off the field.\" \"The fact that Australia never lost a series under his captaincy says so much and those standards were just as high when he turned his attention to calling the game,\" he told cricket.com.au. \"We loved listening to him commentate when the team was together in the dressing room.

Last week, she made it into outer space. A NASA astrophysicist has named an asteroid after the teenage education activist from Pakistan, who was gravely wounded by a Pakistani Taliban gunman for promoting the right of girls' to go to school. It took a meticulous medical response to save her life more than two years ago. But Malala recovered with no serious neurological damage to become a powerhouse for her cause. After reading her story, scientist Amy Mainzer, who also consults for PBS on a children's educational science show, decided Malala deserved to be immortalized. So, she attached her name to the heavens. Thousands of asteroids swarm through the solar system mainly between Mars and Jupiter. Mainzer, working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. \"My postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent brought to my attention the fact that although many asteroids have been named, very few have been named to honor the contributions of women (and particularly women of color),\" Mainzer wrote in a note to Malala. Mainzer gave it the name 316201 Malala, or 2010 ML48. Malala's asteroid circles the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and half years, Mainzer said. \"It is about 4 kilometers in diameter, and its surface is very dark, the color of printer toner.\" As a scientist, her support for Malala's work is logical. When girls around the world also get educations, it increases human potential. \"We desperately need the brainpower of all smart people to solve some of humanity's most difficult problems, and we can't afford to reject half the population's,\" Mainzer wrote.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"NASA astrophysicist, Amy Mainzer, has named an asteroid after Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani education activist who survived an assassination attempt by the Taliban.

The explosion outside the Bauchi Motor Park‎ happened around 8:30 p.m. after a woman left her explosives-laden handbag near a bus filling up with passengers. The bus was heading to the central Nigerian city of Jos, 125 kilometers away. \"There has been an explosion just outside the motor park and five people have been killed while more than 12 others have been seriously injured,\" said Adamu Saidu, an employee at the bus station. \"Some of the injured have had their limbs blown off‎ and one of them has had his eye gouged out,\" said Saidu, who was involved in the evacuation of the victims to a hospital. The woman pretended to be going to Jos and lingered around the bus, which was ‎waiting to fill up with passengers, according to Falalu Tasiu, a grocer near the bus station. \"The woman kept talking on the phone and dropped her bag beside the bus, pretending to be waiting for the bus to fill up,\" Tasiu said. \"She moved towards shops overlooking the bus station as if she was going to buy something and disappeared. Moments later the bag exploded and set the bus on fire, killing five people and inujuring around 15 others,\" Tasiu said. Although no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, Boko Haram Islamists have repeatedly carried out suicide and bombing attacks on bus stations and markets in Gombe and other northern cities, making the group the main suspect. Boko Haram has in recent months been under sustained pressure from sweeping offensives from a four-nation regional alliance of Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon. The regional offensives have considerably weakened Boko Haram's capabilities, which has prompted the Islamists to resort to attacks on soft targets such as bus stations, markets and schools.

But this first meeting of Obama and Castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story. Or at least Obama is hoping it won't be. After all, the President has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits, where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments. The reality is that the United States has been losing ground in this increasingly important region, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance in Panama at the Summit of the Americas if the U.S. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends, but who have drifted away as America has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, America has lost influence in Latin America to a hyperactive China, a cunning Russia and a troubling Iran, all of which have made inroads in the region at Washington's expense. This gathering therefore offers a chance for the U.S. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with Latin American and Caribbean blood who make their homes in the United States. The foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there. But they need attention, and the Panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building. But first: Do no harm. Large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events, and the U.S., with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings, knows the importance of dotting the I's and crossing the T's. But this hasn't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and PR disasters for the U.S. Just look at the last summit, held in Cartagena, Colombia, which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after Secret Service agents embarrassed the United States by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms, in violation of basic security protocols. They were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee. As a result of all this, the Americans looked dumb, incompetent -- and cheap. And back in 2009, the President -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking, fiery anti-American president of Venezuela. The late Hugo Chavez outplayed the leader of the free world, who had just taken office and was trying to show America's new \"outstretched hand\" toward the foe of the George W. Bush era. The summit hit a depressing low for the Obama administration when Chavez walked up to Obama and, as the cameras clicked, handed the American President a copy of the book \"Open Veins of Latin America,\" which blames the region's woes on the U.S. and Europe. Yet the problems in Cartagena weren't just symbolic. Regional leaders lined up against Washington, which had refused to include Cuba in the summit, and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless Havana was also invited. America was cornered. All this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early Clinton years, when the President issued an invitation to \"democratically elected\" heads of state of Latin America, which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship. Back then, the U.S. had just led the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region, namely democracy, free trade and economic growth. That's what it should aim for every time: articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it. Can Obama manage something similar this time? True, the President has come armed with his new Cuba policy. Unfortunately, in an effort to placate critics who say Obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists, the White House has miscalculated with Venezuela, handing the repressive regime of Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, a stick with which to beat the U.S. Obama has long and rightly ignored Maduro's claims that the U.S. planned to overthrow him. But a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed Maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the U.S., something he will no doubt play that up in Panama. All this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with Latin Americans who already have complicated feelings toward the U.S. over its Cold War support for unseemly right-wing dictators, a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing Soviet-backed communism from taking hold. But those days are behind us. Today, the people want prosperity, they want democracy, and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the United States. Too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms: Opposition leaders are in prison in Venezuela; a prosecutor who criticized the President was found dead in Argentina; press freedom is under siege in several countries; and corruption is reaching new highs. All of this suggests that if Obama plays his cards right, he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of Latin America that their goals are also America's goals; that like them, he supports democracy, human rights, the rule of law, full freedom of expression and free elections in every country. The fact that he met with Cuban dissidents was welcome, and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with Cuba. For the millions in Latin America that still live in poverty, these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury. But if Obama can show them that the United States is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives, then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The US has been losing influence in Latin America due to a focus on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East.

The compartment was extremely crowded. As we prepared to disembark, I felt my skirt being lifted and someone groping my private parts. It was terrible. I wanted to scream, but my voice would have drowned in the noise of the crowd. I wanted to push the hands away, but my arms were pinned to my body. I wanted to cry but could only think to myself, \"Stop it! Please stop touching me.\" I was 13 years old. I never told anyone about that day until recently. Twenty-five years later, I continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces. The stories can be stomach churning: men masturbating on buses and at bus stops, boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online, men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the Internet. Then there are just the everyday, uncomfortable stares, frequently accompanied by comments with sexual connotations. This isn't all simply anecdotal. A study by We the People found that 80% of women in Mumbai had been street harassed, primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms. Most people, including women, only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching, groping and stalking, not to mention the \"milder\" forms of ogling, leering, catcalling and whistling, even though all of this can be intimidating. Indeed, many women choose to limit their hours outside, select more conservative clothes, or opt for a longer but safer route home. It was only recently that I realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience I had as a child. I still avoid trains when I can. Most people are silent when inappropriate sexual behavior occurs to women. It was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop I led that \"staring and commenting by men is normal and I've learned to ignore it.\" The reality is that sexual harassment in India is pervasive in all aspects of life. It hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street, take local transport, go about your daily routine or at the workplace. According to U.N. Women's report, 1 in 3 women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime. This statistic is likely even higher in India. Out of the 2,000 women who have attended workshops I've conducted, only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives. Shockingly, less than 10 of them had reported harassment to any official channel. Why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment? Over the past two years, I have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in India. It is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment. I know firsthand. But acknowledging that it is unacceptable is an important first step. India has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace, and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser. But is it enough? Women still have to confront the cultural challenge of not feeling \"ashamed\" and bringing \"disrepute\" to their families while overcoming their fear of dealing with the police, who too often file complaints in the wrong categories to reduce the number of official cases on which their performance is judged. However, despite the barriers, two recent cases in India provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power, coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference. There is, for example, the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss Rajendra Pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages. Her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in Pachauri stepping down from his position as chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Pachauri denied the allegations and insisted his computer and phone were hacked. His counsel stated in court that Pachauri's inbox was not hacked, but he had shared the password with several people who could have sent inappropriate emails to the employee under his name. Similarly, last year, Tarun Tejpal, founder of one of India's leading media companies, was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator. She first told her female editor who reportedly did not take her seriously.  She then spoke about it to her male colleagues who encouraged her to report the incident to the police. Tarun Tejpal, who explained the incident as a \"bad lapse of judgment,\" was let out on interim bail while the case is still ongoing. Women have allies -- both male and female -- who are willing to help clear the barriers. Women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up. The alternative to speaking out is a world where women feel less able to live full lives, restricted and disempowered. We cannot accept harassment as part of our daily routine. We cannot ignore it -- for our own sake and the next generation of women.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"A study by We the People found that 80% of women in Mumbai have been street harassed, primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms.

In 2014, the Nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell, unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 Nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers. The April 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on Mount Everest. The deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. In order to reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed, has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer. \"They're going in the icefall and, as we found out on April 18, it's the most dangerous place,\" said Conrad Anker, a veteran climber who has been to Everest three times. \"They're exposed to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs above it. It's very, very dangerous. It's the most dangerous place I've been in the mountains.\" At this point in the season, climbing teams have not yet entered Khumbu Icefall, which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving. Nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb Mount Everest, with 125 of them from the previously shortened season, according to the Nepal Ministry of Tourism.  It's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year. The local Nepalese committee that determines the path up Everest announced in February that a different route had been selected. The climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the deaths occurred. The committee comprised of Sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. \"There will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left,\" said Yangji Doma Sherpa, the spokeswoman for the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. The central route had been used in the 1990s, but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route, she said. The new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses, and use more vertical and horizontal ladders. The committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders. \"I think it will be an hour longer on the icefall,\" said Alan Arnette, who is blogging from Everest base camp this season. \"I don't think it will be game changer.\" But one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, said it would stop climbing from the Nepal side, where the climbers have to go through the icefall, in favor of the northern route from China. \"We've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years,\" said  Adrian Ballinger, the company's founder and CEO. \"We believe the risk is too great for our workers.\" According to the China Tibet Mountaineering Association, 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to Everest this year. That's 136 more than last year. The Chinese side of Everest has typically been less popular than its Nepal counterpart, because of concerns of government closures. Some Everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain, but it also doesn't have an icefall. The increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side. \"I can already see the shift with mountaineers I speak to,\" said Dawa Steven Sherpa, who is based in Nepal. \"More people are going to go to Tibet than Nepal. Nepal needs the tourism far more than China does. China has incredible wealth of resources and Nepal does not.\" Leading expeditions is how Sherpas feed their families and send their children to school. Nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars. Many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year, and while they may be ready to return to the summit, their families are not. Many of them are \"leaving behind nervous, stressed-out wives and children,\" whose memories of what happened last year are fresh, said Dawa Sherpa, managing director of Asian Trekking. \"They do say they don't want to put them through that again,\" he said. \"They're not fearful for their own lives, it's what they're putting their family through.\" Several mountaineers are also returning this year. One of them is Jon Reiter, who spoke to CNN last year after the tragedy. When the icy avalanche thundered down, Reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his Sherpa guide. Reiter, who is making his way to base camp this year, could not be reached directly. But he explained why he's heading back to Everest this year on his blog. \"I can't quite find the words to tell you why, or what really pulls me back to the mountains,\" he wrote. \"When we were in the midst of last year's events it was hard to see the big picture. It was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it's more rare than not. \"It was hard for me to remember that I'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains. I like to think it's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway.\" CNN's Sugam Pokharel contributed to this report.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Climbers have returned to Mount Everest for this year's climbing season, after a deadly avalanche in 2014, that killed 16 Sherpas, resulted in the closure of the climbing season.

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban advised Twitterers to have their blood tested for everything available -- and to do so every three months. Following her mother's cancer diagnosis, singer Taylor Swift urged her fans to remind their parents to get screening tests.  And Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed legislation to allow Arizonans to get any lab test without a doctor's order. Freedom of information -- always sounds like a good thing. But there are many lab tests to order on yourself: Medicare's Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Fee Schedule lists over a thousand.  They are not all blood tests, but a lot of them are.  And since blood tests require blood, you would surely develop at least one medical problem if you actually followed Mr. Cuban's advice to get them all: anemia. A frothy private sector is gearing up to serve the \"test me\" market.  In those states that allow it -- and over half do -- laboratories are offering walk-in and online services to individuals who want to check their own lab values.  (And if you want to get in on the ground floor of this business, check out the franchise opportunities at Any Labtest Now, Fastest Labs, and All Labtests Fast.) Some might argue that this freedom to test is the path to a healthier society. But the primary effect won't be more health, but rather more medical care.  Fundamentally well people will appear in doctors' offices with \"abnormal\" results.  Abnormalities are common in normal people, as we learned when Whole-body CT scanning was in vogue a decade ago (thankfully, only briefly).  So doctors will increasingly face one of two options: take the time to reassure these new patients that their results aren't really that abnormal or chase down abnormal results with more testing. Further testing will often make clear that the initial results were false alarms.  Or it will confirm the presence of abnormality -- most of which will be minor abnormalities.  Often it won't be clear what to do, but doctors will be pressed to do something.  That's when the real problems begin. Will anybody be helped? Maybe.  Will anybody be hurt?  Definitely.  The disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better.  But it's not that hard for us to make them feel worse. Decades of research have shown that there are real side-effects to testing the well: more anxiety (that can't be good for your health), more procedures (which often involve needles, pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs) and more treatment for \"disease\" not destined to cause problems (as in over a million additional American men treated for prostate cancer, ditto women for breast cancer).  To see how far wrong testing can go, check out South Korea: where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer -- and thyroid cancer surgery -- by 15-fold. I can tell you one thing for sure, the freedom to test won't save money.  Sure, a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests.   But advertising will drive up the volume of testing.  And then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results.  This will cost people real money -- either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out-of-pocket costs. Maybe this kind of freedom of information isn't such a good thing. Of course, there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing.  Diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems.  But if you feel well, don't think that testing will make you feel better. The biotech sector is excited about testing well people -- it's a huge market -- and is developing lots of new product.  Now you can sequence your DNA, soon you will be able to monitor your immune system's signature.  Now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch, soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app.  They are even implanting thermodynamic sensors in a bra to test for breast cancer. A breast cancer monitoring bra -- I can't make this stuff up. Should we outlaw an individual's freedom to test?  No. We don't need another victimless crime.  But it is certainly an area that demands regulation.  The Food and Drug Administration has a longstanding mandate to protect us from snake oil treatments.  Now it needs to start worrying about snake oil testing. It's also an area that demands education.  The public needs to know that while medical data can be very useful, that doesn't mean they are routinely useful.  Abnormalities in sick patients mean something different than the same abnormalities in well people.  It is easier to collect data than it is to know what the data mean -- much less what to do about the results. Freedom is a good thing.  But feel free not to exercise your freedoms.  Just as carrying a gun doesn't necessarily make you any safer, testing yourself doesn't necessarily make you any healthier.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The trend towards self-diagnosis through lab testing, with a view to preempting disease, is growing in the US, with over half of states allowing walk-in and online lab services without a doctor's order. Critics of the trend, however, argue that it is likely to lead to more medical care rather than improved health, with patients presenting themselves to doctors with abnormal results that are often false positives or minor abnormalities. Further testing can lead to increased anxiety, more procedures and over-treatment for diseases unlikely to cause problems. The trend is also likely to increase healthcare costs, through the sheer volume of additional testing, and subsequent office visits for abnormal results. While diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems, they are not necessarily useful for routine check-ups. Critics argue that the sector is in need of regulation and public education about what test results indicate and how to respond to them.\"\n\n\t\tAnnotations:\n\n\t\t\tNo Hallucinated Spans Identified by Annotator\n\n\tSummary (2): \"April is increasingly being referred to as National Get Tested Month, with various individuals and organizations advocating for regular medical testing.

Additionally, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed legislation allowing Arizonans to obtain any lab test without a doctor's order.\n\nHowever, the availability of numerous lab tests raises concerns about the potential for unnecessary testing and its consequences. Medicare's Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Fee Schedule lists over a thousand tests, many of which are blood tests. Seeking all available tests would likely result in anemia or other medical problems. The private sector is capitalizing on this growing demand, with laboratories in states that permit it offering walk-in and online services for individuals to check their own lab values.\n\nWhile some argue that this freedom to test promotes a healthier society, the primary effect may be increased medical care rather than improved health. Normal individuals may present abnormal results to doctors, who will then face the choice of either reassuring patients or pursuing further testing. This can lead to false alarms or the identification of minor abnormalities, often causing confusion regarding appropriate interventions.\n\nTesting the well can have unintended negative consequences, including heightened anxiety, more procedures, and unnecessary treatment. South Korea's increased thyroid cancer rates resulting from ultrasound screening serve as an example. Moreover, the freedom to test does not necessarily save money, as advertising can drive up testing volume and subsequent costs.\n\nWhile diagnostic testing can be beneficial for acute medical problems, it is unlikely to improve well-being. The biotech sector is expanding its offerings for testing healthy individuals, such as DNA sequencing and immune system monitoring. However, regulation and public education are crucial to ensure that medical data are properly understood and acted upon.\n\nIn conclusion, while individual freedom to test should not be outlawed, it requires regulation and education.

This can cause anxiety, discomfort, and even harm to otherwise healthy individuals.\n\nThe push for more testing has led to the development of a \"test me\" market, with companies offering walk-in and online testing services. While this may seem convenient, it is important to remember that just because a test is available, it doesn't mean it's necessary or useful. In fact, studies have shown that excessive testing can lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which can have serious consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of having access to lab tests without a doctor's order may seem appealing, it's important to exercise caution and educate oneself on the potential risks and limitations of testing. It's crucial to understand that not all abnormalities are harmful, and that testing can sometimes do more harm than good.\"\n\n\t\tAnnotations:\n\n\t\t\tNo Hallucinated Spans Identified by Annotator\n\n------\n\nSummary to Evaluate:\n\"# Summary: The Rise of Self-Ordered Medical Testing\n\nThe article discusses the growing trend of self-ordered medical testing, noting that:\n\n- Public figures like Mark Cuban and Taylor Swift are encouraging widespread testing\n- Arizona and over half of US states now allow lab tests without doctor's orders\n- A growing private sector is emerging to serve this \"test me\" market\n\nThe author argues this freedom to test will lead to:\n- More medical care rather than better health\n- Healthy people seeking care for \"abnormal\" results that are often false alarms\n- Increased anxiety, unnecessary procedures, and overtreatment\n- Higher healthcare costs despite lower individual test prices\n\nWhile acknowledging advances in diagnostic testing, the author cautions that:\n- Testing well people rarely makes them feel better but can make them feel worse\n- The FDA should regulate testing to protect consumers\n- Public education is needed about the limited value of routine testing in healthy people\n- Freedom to test doesn't necessarily improve health outcomes\"\n\n------\n\nProvide reasoning first, then clearly state a final classification (Inconsistent if hallucinations of any kind are present, Consistent otherwise) at the end in this format:\n\"Final classification: [Inconsistent / Consistent]\"\nIf the provided text does not summarize the article, state clearly: \"Final classification: Invalid\".\nDo not include any additional text after the final classification.\n", "evaluation_response": "The candidate summary accurately captures the major points of the source article, including the influence of public figures, the facts about Arizona and over half of US states allowing lab tests without a doctor's order, the emergence of the \"test me\" market, and the argument that increased testing among healthy individuals leads to more medical care (with potential false alarms, unnecessary procedures, increased anxiety, and higher overall healthcare costs).

All of the girls died within 24 hours. Like the Busby family, Sharon and Korey Rademacher were hoping for a second child. When they found out what they were having, they decided to keep it a secret from family and friends. That's why they didn't tell their family the gender of baby No. 2 -- or that Sharon was actually expecting not one but two girls, according to CNN affiliate WEAR. And when everyone arrived at West Florida Hospital in Pensacola, Florida, after Sharon gave birth March 11, they recorded everyone's reactions to meeting twins Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith.

The decision was part of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 Americans on the list. But the ACLU isn't satisfied with the government's new policy, outlined in documents filed Monday in federal courts in Oregon (PDF) and Virginia (PDF). \"After years of fighting in court for complete secrecy and losing, it's good that the government is finally now going to tell people of their status on the No Fly List,\" said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project and the lead attorney on the case, in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we've found that the government's new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing. The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again.\" People on the no-fly list, managed by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the United States. The number of people on the list is classified. An official with knowledge of the government's figures told CNN in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names, including about 500 Americans.

In cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive or submit more information about their status, the government will provide a second, more detailed response, identifying \"specific criterion under which the individual has been placed on the No Fly List,\" according to the court documents. An unclassified summary of that information will be provided \"to the extent feasible, consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake,\" court papers said. Those who appear on the no-fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing, with supporting materials or exhibits, and will receive a final written decision from the Transportation Security Administration.

That small boast on social media can trigger a whirlwind that spins into real-life grief, as a Texas veterinarian found out after shooting a cat. Dr. Kristen Lindsey allegedly shot an arrow into the back of an orange tabby's head and posted a proud photo this week on Facebook of herself smiling, as she dangled its limp body by the arrow's shaft. Lindsey added a comment, CNN affiliate KBTX reported. \"My first bow kill, lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it's head! Vet of the year award ... Gladly accepted.\" Callers rang the phones hot at Washington County's Animal Clinic, where Lindsey worked, to vent their outrage. Web traffic crashed its website. High price of public shaming on the Internet. Then an animal rescuer said that Lindsey's prey was probably not a feral cat but the pet of an elderly couple, who called him \"Tiger.\" He had gone missing on Wednesday, the same day that Lindsey posted the photo of the slain cat. CNN has not been able to confirm the claim. As the firestorm grew, Lindsey wrote in the comments underneath her post: \"no I did not lose my job. Lol. Psshh. Like someone would get rid of me. I'm awesome!\" That prediction was wrong. The clinic fired Lindsey, covered her name on its marquee with duct tape, and publicly distanced itself from her actions. \"Our goal now is to go on and try to fix our black eye and hope that people are reasonable and understand that those actions don't anyway portray what we're for here at Washington Animal Clinic,\" said Dr. Bruce Buenger. \"We put our heart and soul into this place.\" The clinic told WBTX that Lindsey was not available for comment. CNN is reaching out to her. She removed her controversial post then eventually shut down her Facebook page. Callers also complained to the Brenham Police Department and Washington County Animal Control, as her Facebook post went viral. The sheriff's office in Austin County, where the cat was apparently shot, is investigating, and Lindsey could face charges. Its dispatchers were overloaded with calls, the sheriff posted on Facebook. \"We are asking you to please take it easy on our dispatchers. As soon as the investigation is complete, we will post the relevant information here on this page,\" the post read. Animal rights activists are pushing for charges. \"Animal cruelty must be taken seriously, and the guilty parties should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,\" said cat advocacy activist Becky Robinson. Her organization, Alley Cat Allies, is offering a $7,500 reward for evidence leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who shot the cat. But others stood up for Lindsey. \"She's amazing. She's caring,\" said customer Shannon Stoddard. \"She's a good vet, so maybe her bad choice of posting something on Facebook was not good. But I don't think she should be judged for it.\" She dropped off balloons at the animal clinic for Lindsey with a thank you note.

The main highway that heads east out of Kathmandu shows massive cracks, the tarmac torn apart by the force of Saturday's huge tremor. One lane is bisected by gaping, half-meter (1.5 feet) fissures. They've been filled in with rubble and dirt, allowing passage for those desperate citizens to reach their families in outlying districts. It takes an age, though, picking our way along damaged roads to a small village community, Ravi Opi. It is only 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of Kathmandu but the journey takes almost two hours -- and the travel times likely to be compounded the farther out from the city people go. The community is off the main highway, down a dirt track that quickly finds itself winding through forested slopes and terraced fields. They farm corn here, and millet, and vegetables. Compared to the capital, and the regions west of Kathmandu and closer to the epicenter, the people here were relatively lucky. Still, passing through villages it's clear that damage has been suffered. In Ravi Opi a village official walks quickly by, telling us over his shoulder that 90% of the houses are currently uninhabitable. Some are still standing, but seem precarious and the residents are too scared of aftershocks to move back inside. Patchy reports have filtered through of entire villages leveled by the quake or engulfed by landslides. Maili Tamang, 62, is alive, but surveys the desolation the quake has wreaked on her life. We find her sitting as close as she can to the ruins of the house that she built with her late husband. She's petite and frail but hardened by life. Her leg, bandaged and suppurating, is stretched out in front of her. She periodically flicks at the flies that have settled on the blood- and pus-soaked dressing. \"I just want to cry, all I feel is hurt \" she says, showing us where she was the moment the earthquake struck. Tamang's house was one of the bigger ones in this region, a rare two-story structure. She and her husband built it together, a lifetime ago. He died years ago, but her extended family lived here with her until Saturday. She, along with her daughter-in-law were indoors when the quake struck, and she was lucky to make it out onto a small wooden balcony. Another tremor brought this down and she had to extricate herself from the rubble and crawl up an embankment. The younger woman, trapped in the wreckage after the roof fell in on her, eventually clawed her way out. She was transported by motorbike -- few here have motorized transportation; most walk -- to a missionary hospital in a neighboring village, 12 kilometers (7.4 miles) away from here. Now she is back, wondering what the next step for her is. Throughout this region, there have been small landslides and people have been industrious in clearing rubble from the roads. There is little sign of aid having made it out here. Out of necessity people are back working their fields. Near the road a family makes lunch in the open as their house was destroyed. Elsewhere in Ravi Opi, other unfortunate families count the cost of the disaster. Mahesh Koiraba, 31, lost his only daughter, Prati in the quake, who was killed as their house collapsed. She was 2 years old. He was working when the quake hit, tilling the fields like so many in Kavre, and ran back to his house after quickly realizing the force of the tremor. \"I started digging with my hands,\" he says, still very much in shock, but remembering his frantic efforts among the remains of his damaged home. \"And I saw her, blood was trickling from her mouth and she was covered in cuts.\" All he has left now is a picture in his phone; a chubby-faced toddler, wearing oversized sunglasses. As rain starts falling -- soon turning into torrents and further hampering recovery efforts -- we huddle with four families who have been displaced. They're in a makeshift, ramshackle shelter, crowded with frightened people. I ask one of the young women, Osminda Koirale, with me if she has seen any sign of outside help. \"No, no government has any support for us. No one has come out to see that we're living like this.\" She said it was terrifying, and the future no less so. \"Our house is gone now. We don't know where we sit, what we eat. We don't have any clothes, all our clothes are inside. We can't go inside our houses.\" There was a creeping sense that the worst was over, until another powerful aftershock overnight. \"We are not safe ... we are so scared,\" Osminda tells me. And all this a mere 90 minutes drive from the capital. There are parts of Nepal so remote it takes days to reach under normal circumstances -- there are villages here that one can only reach on foot and it is those areas that were hardest hit. These are the places where aid has yet to arrive, and where no one really knows the full extent of human loss or how many tragedies like the one at this home have unfolded.

I started to hear rumblings coming from around the perimeter of the immediate crowd. There was shouting and cursing. Bottle throwing. Then a car was turned over and set on fire. That was Miami 35 years ago, but it could just as easily have been Baltimore this week. The Miami riots of 1980 were the first major \"race riots\" since the wave of riots spread across the nation in the 1960s. Harlem 1964: Police shooting of 15-year-old James Powell. Watts 1965: Arrest of 21-year-old Marquette Frye for drunken driving. Newark 1967: Police beating of John Smith while under arrest. Detroit 1967: Police raid on a \"blind pig\" after-hours bar. Then the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, and Baltimore and 125 other cities erupted in flames. The immediate catalysts for the waves of riots in the 1960s before the death of Dr. King were police action, or, more specifically, perceived unjust police action. That was true in Miami in 1980 after the acquittal of the police officers. And the same in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers for the beating of motorist Rodney King. Wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the start of the Los Angeles riots. And now we have Baltimore 2015, with the death of suspect Freddie Gray in police custody. My parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement, and they raised me to understand that youths were the key to the movement. It was the images of young people all over the country -- often facing physical danger, discipline from their parents and suspension from school -- that propelled the civil rights movement into the national spotlight. Juxtapose decades-old images of youths being hosed down by police during nonviolent demonstrations in Birmingham and Selma with Tuesday's images of Baltimore youths throwing rocks at police, and you wonder what has happened. As a 12-year-old girl in Miami, I didn't understand how people could injure and even kill others and destroy their neighborhoods, and risk going to jail, by rioting. I was afraid because I didn't see my father for days as he and other community leaders walked the streets to try to restore calm. I was also afraid that such senseless violence could only derail the legitimate causes of the African-American community, causes historically advanced by nonviolent civil disobedience and through legislative channels. But two months ago, I agreed to moderate a panel at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights called \"Riot -- The Voice of the Unheard?\" The occasion was to mark the Atlanta premiere of \"Detroit '67,\" a play written by Dominique Morisseau and directed by Kamilah Forbes that chronicled the journey of a family as they lived through the turmoil of the Detroit '67 riot, including the joy and love they found with one another. The play and the panel were programmed by Kenny Leon's True Colors Theatre Company, a nonprofit devoted to presenting artistic interpretations with diverse voices so that individuals and institutions can have a shared platform in their quest for understanding in American society. Inspired by the mission, I had recently joined the board. Although pegged to the past, the purpose of the panel was to examine how current events relating to police actions against African-American men could potentially lead to rioting and what could be done to prevent it. I learned that some questioned whether riots are actually purposeless and uncontrolled violence, or whether they are purposeful uprisings against individuals and institutions. I learned that those who participate in riots often feel hopeless and dehumanized, both as the victims of police action against them that triggered the riots and as perpetrators of violence during riots. I learned that riots in the 1960s played a role in advancing the civil rights agenda, often by galvanizing local and national government officials to work with peaceful community, church and civil rights leaders to address the root causes of riots. This is a controversial part of our civil rights history that has been sanitized. At the conclusion of the 1967 Detroit riot, President Lyndon Johnson condemned the violence but said in his address to the nation that: \"This is not a time for angry reaction. It is a time for action, starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities. The strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for tragedy in the street. ...\" His administration convened the Kerner Commission to examine the 1965-68 riots, and its findings were that racism had led to joblessness, poverty, a lack of political power, unfair housing, police brutality and inferior schools. After the beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, the Christopher Commission was established and concluded that racial profiling and excessive force, unjust treatment in the criminal justice system, poor housing, and the lack of jobs and education were triggers for the riots. After all of these riots, the affected city, state and national governments enacted plans and programs to address some of these underlying conditions. Maybe the Baltimore youths involved in the riots felt the way one youth did in Watts in 1965. As recounted in \"The Great Rebellion\" by Kenneth Stahl, Dr. King went to Watts to try to calm tensions, and a hostile youth said to him:  \"We won.\" King challenged him: \"How have you won? Homes are destroyed, blacks are dead in the streets, stores you shop from for food and clothes are destroyed.\" The young man replied, \"We won because we made the whole world pay attention ... the police chief and mayor had never been here. We made them come.\" Dr. King would say near the end of his life: \"It is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.\" When I learned that Baltimore high school students planned a purge based on the movie \"The Purge,\" in which people were legally absolved for their anarchistic crimes, it suddenly made sense. They thought they wouldn't be held responsible for their crimes. They thought they would be absolved -- a word not much different from the word \"acquitted\" I learned the day of the Miami riots. But they got it wrong. They will forever live the repercussions of their actions, regardless of the impetus. But the Rev. Jamal Bryant got it right when he said he would open his Empowerment Temple AME Church in Baltimore to youths who would not be in school so he could teach them the power of nonviolence to change society. That power was evident after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the decision not to indict the officer who killed him. Those protests were mostly peaceful. And the government responded -- not out of fear of violence, but because of a desire to change the conditions that led to the protests. After several months of investigation, the far-reaching Justice Department report on Ferguson issued in March concluded that the use of policing to raise revenue, combined with a systemic racial bias, had led to a pattern and practice of discrimination and Fourth, 14th, Sixth and First Amendment rights violations against African-Americans in Ferguson. The report made recommendations that the Ferguson Police Department, as well as other departments across the country, should enact to improve police relations in communities of color. The riots in Baltimore have rightfully been quashed, but the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The Baltimore riots of 2015, after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, reminded a Miami resident of a similar incident 35 years ago when a peaceful demonstration against the acquittal of four police officers in the beating of unarmed motorist Arthur McDuffie, turned violent.

The institute is working with state health leaders to control the \"severe outbreak,\" which has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results, all in rural Scott and Jackson counties. This is a huge number of cases for an area that has a population of only a few thousand people. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. Scott County, the epicenter of the outbreak, has only one doctor who deals with infectious disease, but the doctor is not an HIV specialist, the State Department of Health said. Since the rampant HIV outbreak was first noticed in mid-December, the state has tried to flood the area with additional resources. Indiana declared a public health emergency in that county in March. Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a clinic, open once a week to help treat people and test them for HIV. These workers are also going door to door to try to educate the population about the danger of sharing needles. So far, 33 patients have visited the temporary clinic, which is starting to see patients return to seek treatment. It's no coincidence that many of the cases of the newly infected there are younger people \"who weren't around in the '80s and '90s when HIV was at its peak,\" Dr. Jonathan Mermin said. In the 1980s, doctors were seeing an average of 35,000 new HIV infections among IV drug users, and that figure has been down 90% nationally, he said. So people aren't as aware about the danger of sharing needles. Mermin is the director of the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. Education will be key, he emphasized. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence also signed a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange. It was set to expire Friday, but he extended the order another 30 days Tuesday. Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. The state is also offering job services to people in the area. Dr. Joan Duwve, the chief medical consultant with the Indiana State Department of Health, spoke at length about how communities all along the Ohio River in her state and in Kentucky and West Virginia have seen a huge problem with prescription drug abuse, particularly in areas where there \"is not a lot to do.\" Many family members, across generations, live in the same house and will use the drugs together as \"a community activity,\" Duwve said. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. She said this has been a problem for these areas for at least a decade. Another reason this infection has spread so rapidly is the nature of the drug itself. Opana, as the prescription opioid is known, needs to be injected more than once a day. Duwve said residents have reported injecting it four to 10 times a day to stay under its influence. When people start to feel the drug wear off after about four hours, they begin to feel sick and go into withdrawal. Often they'll turn to an injecting partner in the same house who will share their needle and their drug to give the person relief from these symptoms. The other problem with this drug is that it requires a larger-gauge needle that exposes users to more blood, which increases the risk of infection. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. There has been a 150% increase in hepatitis C between 2010 and 2013, the majority of the increase believed to be from injection drug abusers, the CDC said. \"The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning not to let our guard down,\" Mermin said. \"This is a powerful reminder\" that HIV and other infectious diseases \"can gain ground at any time, unless you remain vigilant.\"\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"There has been a severe outbreak of HIV in a rural Indiana county, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: \"At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs.\" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. \"Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital.\" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that \"the website\" was accurate. A doctor's capacity declaration stated that Mitchell will likely be unable, due to her medical condition, to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months.

My guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt Team Clinton to put its candidate on the road, where she can continue holding loosely scheduled, informal meetings with ordinary Americans -- the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to Bill Clinton in hopes of getting special treatment by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It's not that the alleged conflicts aren't potentially serious; as I recently noted in these pages, they are. According to The Wall Street Journal, in 2014 the Clinton Foundation \"received money from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman, among others. The donors included Canada's foreign affairs department, which is promoting the Keystone XL pipeline.\" That's the same Keystone XL pipeline from Canada that the State Department all but endorsed, concluding after a five-part analysis that ran to 17,000 pages that the project's environmental impact would be minimal. President Obama vetoed a bill that would have allowed the pipeline to be built, but it's legitimate to ask whether the donation from Canada directly or indirectly influenced the State Department's analysis. And several news outlets have reported that banks and other companies with business before the U.S. government were donors to the Clinton Global Initiative, a sister group that was spun off from the Clinton Foundation. CNN's Alexandra Jaffe wrote last month that \"listings for the Clinton Global Initiative's Annual Meeting found partnerships with at least six banks that were under investigation, involved in litigation or had been fined by government agencies and regulators at the time of the meeting. In every case, the bank in question was listed as a sponsor of the event even after the investigations were widely reported in the media.\" Those are serious matters -- but so are stubborn unemployment, troubled schools, high taxes and other problems that top the list of voters' concerns. A bank giving money to charity in hopes of buying leniency from the government is a cause for concern, but until and unless a smoking gun appears in the form of a clear exchange of money for favors, it becomes hard to say what, exactly, is wrong with donating cash to aid in a good cause like combating world hunger or helping to rebuild Haiti. Even among the banks fined for wrongdoing that contributed to Clinton charities, noted Jaffe, \"there's no indication the Clintons had any knowledge of the ongoing investigations into banks supporting the foundation's efforts.\" That doesn't leave much room for outrage. A more serious critique of the Clinton foundations is that they have been an administrative and financial quagmire from their origins, running deficits, expanding uncontrollably and cutting deals that not only raise ethical questions but cast the family's management skill in a less-than-flattering light. In a well-known case of deception, a con man named Raffaello Follieri charmed his way into the foundation's good graces, earning public praise from Bill Clinton for promising $50 million to the Clinton Global Initiative -- money that never materialized. A more serious problem developed internally, with staff members fighting over the direction and management of the charities. In 2007 and 2008, the foundation ran a $40 million deficit and in 2012 had an $8 million deficit. So we already knew that the Clintons' charities suffered from poor management and took money from companies and governments that were clearly trying to curry favor. It's distasteful, but by now it's not news. Unless the forthcoming book unveils some blockbuster new information, questions about the Clintons' charities is likely to wind up on the same political shelf on which voters seem to have parked concerns about Hillary Clinton's use of private emails to conduct State Department business. According to a recent poll by the rightward-leaning Rasmussen -- taken after the email issue was splashed all over the news -- a survey of voters likely to vote in 2016 found that 57% expect Clinton to win the presidency. No wonder Clinton seemed positively unconcerned about the forthcoming book. \"We're back into the political scene, and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and I'm ready for it,\" she said in New Hampshire. Calling extensive exposure of conflicts of interest \"distractions\" suggests that Clinton knows what the polls suggest: that in a nation still struggling to emerge from a long recession, voters will likely judge her on something other than the efficiency and ethics of her charities.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"A new book, titled \"Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich\", is due to be released on 5 May 2015. The book will bring to light issues raised over the efficiency and ethics of the Clintons' charitable operations. The Clinton Foundation has already faced criticism for its mismanagement of funds, having run a $40 million deficit in 2007 and 2008, and an $8 million deficit in 2012. Donations to the Clinton Foundation include large sums from companies and foreign governments, many of whom are involved in legal cases, have controversial reputations, or are looking to gain favour with the Clintons in return. In addition to this, the Clinton Global Initiative, a sister operation to the Clinton Foundation, has also faced similar criticism over its donors. Despite this, a recent Rasmussen poll found that 57% of likely voters in the 2016 election expect Hillary Clinton to win the presidency.\"\n\n\t\tAnnotations:\n\n\t\t\tNo Hallucinated Spans Identified by Annotator\n\n\tSummary (2): \"The upcoming release of the book \"Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich\" by Peter Schweizer is expected to raise questions and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the Clinton family. The book is set to be released on May 5, and it is predicted that these issues will prompt Hillary Clinton's campaign to put her on the road to meet with ordinary Americans and divert attention away from the controversy. While the conflicts of interest are potentially serious, with the Clinton Foundation receiving money from countries like United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, as well as banks and companies with business before the U.S. government, it is hard to determine if there was a clear exchange of money for favors. The more significant critique of the Clinton foundations is their poor management and financial struggles, including deficits and deals that raise ethical questions.

He was 59. The Sydney native, who also worked with New Zealander Jackson on the remake of \"King Kong\" (2005) and \"The Lovely Bones\" (2009), suffered a heart attack Monday. Said a spokesman from the Australian Cinematographers Society: \"We have been advised of the sudden death of Andrew,\" adding that his family would provide an official statement later. Known for balancing technology with artistic considerations, Lesnie also shot \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" (2011), directed by Rupert Wyatt. The cinematographer recently polished off The Water Diviner, the directorial debut of Russell Crowe, another New Zealand native. That movie opened Friday in U.S. theaters. Said Crowe on Twitter: \"Devastating news from home. The master of the light, genius Andrew Lesnie has passed on.\" Lesnie won his Oscar for his work on the first of the fabled \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001). His knack for getting the right feel of author J.R.R. Tolkien's most foreboding locales was remarkable. For the inaugural \"Lord of the Rings\" film, Jackson reached out to Lesnie after seeing his work on \"Babe\" (1995) and its 1998 sequel. Those Australian films, revolving around a pig and other animals, featured impressive visual effects and proved to be big hits at the worldwide box office. \"I'd never worked with him or even met him before, but he'd shot the Babe films and I thought they looked amazing, the way he'd used backlight and the sun and natural light to create a very magical effect,\" Jackson said in a 2004 interview. \"And Babe had that larger-than-life feel about it that I wanted. \"So when we began looking for DPs in early 1999, I first decided to get either an Australian or New Zealand DP, as they'd be used to the way we make films,\" Jackson continued. \"Every country is slightly different in that way, and I immediately thought of Andrew. \" Lesnie's impressive body of work also includes the post-apocalyptic science fiction film \"I Am Legend\" (2007), directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith; \"The Last Airbender\" (2010), from M. Night Shyamalan; and Healing (2014), helmed by Craig Monahan. He was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002. Lesnie studied film and television at TAFE (a provider of vocational education) and at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School before joining the Australian Broadcasting Corp. as a camera assistant. He honed his craft on low-budget short films and music videos and assisted on documentaries, features and commercials.

Nevertheless, Google continues to market a smartphone application that lets lawbreakers pinpoint the location of police officers in the field. Google's executives won't even discuss the subject with organizations representing law enforcement. Google's popular real-time traffic app, Waze, uses GPS navigation and crowdsourcing to alert users to traffic jams, automobile accidents, stalled cars, and through its \"traffic cop\" feature, the presence of law enforcement. Most people undoubtedly use Waze's police-finding feature to avoid traffic tickets, but the app poses an enormous risk to deputies and police officers. In the days before he assassinated New York police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu at point blank range while they sat in their patrol car last December, Ismaaiyl Brinsley is known to have used the Waze application to monitor the movements of police officers. The killer identified the location of police on his own Waze account and even posted screen captures to Instagram. While Google (which acquired Waze in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion) claims the app \"is all about contributing to the 'common good' out there on the road,\" the risks far outweigh the potential benefits. Every day, thousands of police officers and deputies enforce traffic laws, execute arrest and search warrants, investigate domestic violence complaints and perform countless tasks that are needed to keep our neighborhoods safe and remove criminals from the streets. It takes just a couple of clicks on Waze's \"traffic cop\" icon to identify their locations and indicate whether -- in the opinion of the anonymous user -- the officer is \"visible\" or \"invisible.\" At that moment, the officer or deputy becomes an identifiable target whose whereabouts are available to any one of Waze's 50 million users worldwide. Social media has made enormous contributions to law enforcement as a \"force multiplier\" that lets citizens help police protect our communities. As we have seen with the emergence of crimes like identity theft, however, technology has the potential for evil as well as good. In the case of Waze, we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies, whose roles in society are to protect our citizens and enforce the laws that keep our communities safe. Google, whose stated mission is \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" is now marketing an app with the potential to obstruct law enforcement and put the lives of police officers and deputies at risk. Even the more benign uses of Waze's \"traffic cop\" feature are concerning. In 2013, 10,076 people were killed in alcohol-related automobile accidents. And in 2011, 9,944 people lost their lives in speed-related fatal crashes. Is the highest, best use of Google's geo-mapping and crowdsourcing capabilities to help drunk drivers avoid checkpoints and give speeders assistance in evading speed limits? It's not just the speeders and drunk drivers who have access to the locations of police officers through Google's technology. Perpetrators of domestic violence can use it to find out about the presence of law enforcement in a spouse's neighborhood; gang members, narcotics dealers, even those intent on perpetrating an act of terror, all have access to Waze's \"traffic cop\" feature. Google has built a solid reputation as a good corporate neighbor, tying for first place in a 2013 study by the Reputation Institute measuring companies' reputations for corporate social responsibility. The company makes much of its compliance with legal, moral and ethical obligations as a good corporate neighbor. But when it comes to Waze, Google has gone into a defensive crouch. The company's executives flat out refused to discuss the subject with representatives of the National Sheriffs' Association, an organization representing more than 3,000 sheriff's offices across the United States. The refusal of Google's executives to even dignify our concerns by meeting with us offends our conscience. If Google's real objective is the \"common good out there on the road,\" it will work with us to ensure the safety of both motorists and police officers.

Because of that, one's response to such imagery often becomes calloused or desensitized. This concept of \"how we digest images of war through mainstream media outlets,\" was what drove photographer Simon Brann Thorpe to begin his project \"Toy Soldiers.\" This idea to create a fresh perspective drove him into the desert of Western Sahara, a long-disputed region of northwestern Africa. Thorpe uses the area's harsh landscape as a powerful backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines -- similar to the popular toys that many children play with. The soldiers are with the Polisario Front, an independence movement that has been clashing with Morocco over the region since the mid-1970s. Thorpe said his project enables \"the creation of a visual metaphor from which a viewer develops their own emotional, physical and political response to war and conflict, when faced with the realization that the images do not contain toy soldiers but real soldiers.\" Thorpe's background was not in photojournalism, but in landscape photography, which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between Morocco and the Polisario Front. \"The conflict in Western Sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there,\" Thorpe said. After a ceasefire in 1991, the people of Western Sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution. The people are split into two camps -- those living in Moroccan-occupied territory, and those in refugee camps in Algeria. Social media.

Thorpe had to get clearance to work with the Polisario Front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the United Nations. He usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time. The autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun. Thorpe would work with the troops' commander to position the men, then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images. They would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars. Not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project, but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on. Thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums. After the elaborate five-week production, Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on \"how images of war (will) be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them.\" Simon Brann Thorpe's \"Toy Soldiers\" book is available for pre-order through Dewi Lewis Publishing.

The Kentucky Wildcats' bid for perfection ended Saturday night at the hands of the Wisconsin Badgers, who rallied for a tough 71-64 victory in the NCAA men's basketball Final Four at Indianapolis. They will meet four-time national champ Duke in Monday night's title game. The Blue Devils dominated Michigan State 81-61 in the first contest of the night. National player of the year finalist Frank Kaminsky led Wisconsin with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Junior forward Sam Dekker added 16 points. \"These guys just gutted it out.,\" Wisconsin Head Coach Bo Ryan said. \"We just kept battling on every possession.\" Freshman Karl-Anthony Towns led Kentucky with 16 points. Sophomore Andrew Harrison chipped in 13 points while Aaron Harrison had 12 points. Kentucky came into the game as the first men's team to have a 38-0 record. But the Badgers fought back from a 60-56 deficit with 6:39 left in the game. Wisconsin went on an 8-0 run to regain a lead it never relinquished. It will be looking to win its first title since 1941. As the final minutes ticked off, the Wildcats failed to score. They were stuck on 60 for five minutes. The Harrison twins, who shot well in the first half, couldn't get much done offensively. \"I didn't execute. I mean, we didn't execute as a team, but me being the point guard, I didn't do what coach told me to on a couple of occasions,\" Andrew Harrison said at the postgame news conference. His coach sternly interjected. \"He did fine. He did fine,\" John Calipari said. Meanwhile, Dekker stepped up, making a layup, a three-pointer and a free throw as the Badgers scooted ahead. Calipari said the Badgers did a good job defending the Kentucky big men. \"They crowded us a little bit, and (our) guys got a little tentative,\" he said. Calipari looked at the stat sheet: Kentucky had only six turnovers, hit 90% of its free throws, made 48% of its field goals, and lost. He said his team struggled to guard Wisconsin's players, and the rebound battle -- which Wisconsin won by 12 -- was crucial. Kamisky, who turned 22 on Saturday, was asked how the Badgers outrebounded a team that is the tallest in basketball. \"We stayed into them, attacking them, trying to do whatever we can,\" he said. \"Just trying to keep them off the glass was one of our main priorities.\" Freshman Justise Winslow led Duke with 19 points while national freshman of the year Jahlil Okafor had 18 points, 10 of which came in the first half. Senior guard Quinn Cook had 17. \"The defense was terrific,\" Duke Head Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \"We drove the ball with such strength. I actually think our offense gave our defense a push.\" Junior guard Denzel Valentine sparked the Spartans with three early three-pointers and finished with 22 points and a game-high 11 rebounds. Senior guard Travis Trice had 16 points. The Spartans, of the Big Ten, began the game in a higher gear than Duke, and quickly took an eight-point lead. But after Valentine hit his trio of long-range shots and Michigan State led 14-6, the Spartans struggled to get baskets the rest of the first half. \"They did a good job of denying us and forcing us out (farther from the basket). We took some bad shots,\" Valentine said. Duke occasionally used a 2-3 zone defense that protected some of its players with foul concerns and slowed the Spartans down. But it was when Duke played man-to-man that the Spartans really had a hard time scoring. State made five of its first seven shots, then only made three more in the final 16 minutes of the opening half. The Blue Devils, of the Atlantic Coast Conference, found baskets inside as the 6-foot-11, 270-pound Okafor powered for points around the basket. Winslow used his quickness to score seven points in the first half, but he only played 12 minutes because he committed two fouls. Duke led at halftime 36-25, a turnaround of 19 points from its early deficit. \"Coach always stresses that great defense leads to great offense,\" Cook said. The confidence gained in getting defensive stops led to the desire for Duke players to drive the lane instead of shooting three-pointers. \"We saw seams that we could take advantage of,\" Cook said. In the second half, Duke increased its lead to 20 points, then cruised home. The Spartans were never able to cut the deficit to single digits and Duke sank its free throws in the final minutes. \"We got beat and ...  Duke played awfully well, but I thought it wasn't one of our better games,\" Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo said. The Blue Devils apparently like playing in Final Fours in Indianapolis, home of the NCAA. It won titles there in 1991 and 2010. The other two crowns came in 1992 and 2001, each in Minneapolis. Duke has beaten Wisconsin this season, 80-70 in Wisconsin in December. If Duke wins Monday night, it would tie Indiana and North Carolina for third-most NCAA championships with five.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The Wisconsin Badgers ended the Kentucky Wildcats' bid for perfection on Saturday night by rallying for a tough 71-64 victory in the NCAA men's basketball Final Four in Indianapolis.

The U.N.-sponsored talks should resume \"but only after a complete halt of attacks,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in a Facebook post. The previous round of talks between Houthi rebels and the government of Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi failed in January after rebels attacked the President's personal residence and presidential palace in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its Operation Decisive Storm, a nearly monthlong air campaign against Houthi positions. The Saudi-led coalition said a new initiative was underway, Operation Renewal of Hope, focused on the political process. But less than 24 hours later, after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni government military brigade, the airstrikes resumed, according to security sources in Taiz. Five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late Wednesday, two Taiz security officials said. Explosions lasted for about 40 minutes, they said. It was unclear whether it was a resumption of the operation or a short-term series of strikes. Meanwhile, Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi in Sanaa on Wednesday, according to a senior Saudi source speaking on condition of anonymity. The Houthis had said they detained the defense minister at an air base near the Yemeni port city of Aden on March 26, shortly before the Saudis began their airstrike campaign. The rebels captured the base that day as part of an advance on the Aden area. The United Nations demanded al-Subaihi's release earlier this month. Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen starting on March 26, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that overthrew the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government -- a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda -- which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. Houthi leader: 'Anyone who thinks we will surrender is dreaming' But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back \"security and stability through establishing a political process,\" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Hadi, who claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader, thanked the Saudi-led coalition. He is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,\" said Hadi. In the country's south, security officials on Wednesday reported two U.S. drone strikes against al Qaeda militants in Mukalla. Six suspected militants died in the attack. This is the second drone strike in three days. On Monday, six militants were killed when drone strikes targeted two vehicles in Shabwah, west of Mukalla. A U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday that the United States is conducting \"manned reconnaissance\" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last few days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Nic Robertson, Salim Essaid, Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Houthi rebels have called for peace talks, but only after all attacks have ceased.

He stressed that urgent support from the military and security forces is needed to save the city. \"This is what we warned Baghdad of what's going to happen,\" Essawi told CNN by phone, referring to the Iraqi government at the capital. \"Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi?\" His plea for help comes the day after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington to seek more support for the fight against ISIS. \"Just Allah knows if we will survive this,\" Essawi said. According to the Anbar official, at least 10 Iraqi security forces were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in the fighting against ISIS on Wednesday. The extremist group's offensive in Ramadi shows its resilience despite months of U.S.-led airstrikes and its recent defeat by Iraqi forces in the northern city of Tikrit. ISIS fighters have Ramadi under pressure from several angles. Essawi said ISIS militants made significant advances Wednesday in three areas east of Ramadi: Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem and parts of Soufia, which leads to central Ramadi. Later, he said that militants were rolling into the center of Ramadi. Over the weekend, the militants seized control of areas north of Ramadi. Routes south of the city were taken some months ago. That leaves only areas to the west of Ramadi in the hands of government forces, but those positions are under threat, Essawi warned. The recent fighting has driven a steady stream of refugees out of the city. On Wednesday, some residents packed what they could into metal carts as they prepared to flee on foot. People also were fleeing the areas where ISIS was advancing east of Ramadi. At least 150,000 people have already fled since Wednesday morning, causing huge traffic jams on the roads leading outside the city, according to Essawi. A CNN team met with three families that had fled an ISIS assault in the Albu Ghanem area. Those families said Iraqi security and military forces withdrew from Albu Ghanem after a battle with ISIS, which took over the area quickly. One fleeing Albu Ghanem resident, Abu Ahmed, paused to talk to CNN as he and his family walked east toward Baghdad, crossing a bridge over the Euphrates River. He said four ISIS militants had entered his house and set up a sniper position on his roof. Abu Ahmed said he, his wife and four children walked away from the home with his elderly mother while the ISIS fighters were busy setting things up there. He said his family left everything behind. His family was using a cart to carry his mother, who couldn't walk. While talking about the fighters' takeover of his home, his wife started crying and asked God to help the rest of the families who are stuck in Albu Ghanem. Ramadi has seen intense and persistent fighting for months. ISIS took over parts of the city in the first half of last year, placing it at the heart of a deadly tug of war ever since. The U.S. military has carried out multiple airstrikes against ISIS targets near Ramadi in recent weeks. \"The coalition has been supporting the fight in Ramadi with airstrikes, and there have been seven airstrikes in Ramadi since Monday,\" Col. Ed Thomas, spokesman for Joint Chiefs Chairman Col. Martin Dempsey, said on Wednesday. He stressed that Ramadi remains contested. Another U.S. military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN that the fall of Ramadi is \"not imminent.\" Sizable parts of the city are under ISIS control or influence, but the area has been a target of a months-long offensive, that official said. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Arwa Damon reported from west of Baghdad, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Jason Hanna, Jim Sciutto, Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The city of Ramadi in Iraq is under serious threat from ISIS, with the terrorist group having made significant advances in three areas to the east of the city. &nbsp;Falih Essawi, deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, has pleaded for reinforcements from the Iraqi government and the US-led coalition against ISIS as he warns that he does not know how much longer government troops can hold their front lines against the ISIS offensive. &nbsp;However, the US military has stated that the fall of Ramadi is &ldquo;not imminent&rdquo;. &nbsp;Essawi has also warned that ISIS is threatening areas to the west of Ramadi that are currently in the hands of government forces.\"\n\n\t\tAnnotations:\n\n\t\t\tNo Hallucinated Spans Identified by Annotator\n\n\tSummary (2): \"ISIS militants are nearing the key Iraqi city of Ramadi, according to Falih Essawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council.

Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make:. \"Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn.  And the gap is even greater for women of color. That's unconscionable.  As president, my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100% of the population is paid 100% of what they're worth.  And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. And I won't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise, too.\" April 14 wasn't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day. It's based on a calculation: For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014, they'd have to work until April 14, 2015. A woman on average loses $431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career. Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty.  And at a time where Republicans are still, bizarrely, trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy, closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights. So here's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is, literally. In her campaign launch and personal rebrand, Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people, a populist fighter for the middle class. \"Everyday Americans need a champion,\" Clinton said in her campaign launch video, \"and I want to be that champion.\" Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Indeed, the fact that many Democratic voters still clamor for a less pro-war, less pro-Wall Street, more Elizabeth Warren-like alternative to Clinton is an ever-present thorn in the otherwise blooming garden of Clinton's inevitability. Opinion: The myth of Equal Pay Day. With her video, Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism. But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart, has already lived in the White House, collects six-figure speaking fees and doesn't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter? This is where a good ol'-fashioned political stunt would come in handy.  And make no mistake about it, I'm recommending a political stunt. Let's call a spade a spade. Hillary Clinton is a very rich person. While she's certainly not the first rich person to run for president, her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy. The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary, or $308,000, is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton's bank account at this point. And yet the symbolic power is profound. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. 78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap. Thanks to the hacked Sony emails, we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts. What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary? Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it. Is it offensive to suggest that the first female commander in chief should be paid 23% less than her male predecessors for doing exactly the same work?  Yes. And that's the point -- to use her status to highlight the offensive gender wage gap and what Clinton, as president, would do to fix it. Yes, such stunts are trite and theatrical.  They're also effective, especially in our increasingly short-attention-span, it-only-happened-if-you-can-tweet it, symbolism-over-substance culture. Politics used to be about clunky people (mostly men) debating complex policies. Now it's about polished memes and even more polished candidates. Policy (I hope) still matters, but we're as likely to debate a candidate's \"image\" as her or his \"substance.\" The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics, as they are in our culture in general. That doesn't mean they can't also serve a noble purpose, in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest. Clinton did an arguably brilliant thing in her campaign launch, framing her video and presidential bid as not about her but the American people. In fact, Clinton didn't even appear in the video until the very end -- it was all about middle-class Americans, working hard, trying to get by and get ahead. And then we see Hillary, who wants to help. Hillary Clinton can't change who she is, the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left, rightly or wrongly. But she can change what she does going forward, how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change. If Clinton wins, her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic. And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"On Tuesday, April 14, or &lsquo;Equal Pay Day&rsquo;, Hillary Clinton is being called upon to make a statement on gender pay inequality, and pledge to take a 23% pay cut if elected president.

We are all familiar with the brutality of ISIS, the self-anointed Islamic State, or Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to ISIS. This new wave of violent Islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose: It is part of the larger plan of building a \"caliphate,\" a Sharia-ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group's interpretation of life in the early days of Islam. Yazidi girls who slipped ISIS after its siege of Mount Sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for ISIS fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by Human Rights Watch found  \"a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by ISIS forces,\" actions that the group says \"are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity.\" In Nigeria, Boko Haram also has a very specific approach to women. The 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2,000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014, according to  Amnesty International. There, too, women captives move from house to house and village to village, forced to convert when they are not Muslim, and prepare for marriage to jihadis. It's a stark change from the previous generation of jihadis, when Osama bin Laden headed al Qaeda. Women were not a big part of al Qaeda's immediate plans because al Qaeda, unlike ISIS, viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal, one for future generations. In contrast, ISIS is actively engaged in building those social structures. And if you want to build a new society, you need more than soldiers. You also need women. Women are indispensable for establishing a functioning community, even one whose laws are brutally repressive. Even if women are viewed as the property of men, they are still needed, not just for cooking, cleaning and sex, but to keep the home and raise children; hence the methodical capture, assault and subjugation. It is no accident that Boko Haram has targeted students, as it did in Chibok, or that Somalia's Al-Shabaab Islamists killed scores of women in the massacre at Kenya's Garissa University in Kenya. As in previous conflicts, women are spoils of war and rape is a weapon of war. It is a way to humiliate the enemy, a \"reward\" for soldiers and a tactic of ethnic cleansing. During the Bosnian war of the 1990s, experts said Serbian soldiers engaged in systematic rape, thinking the babies of raped Bosnian Muslim women would be Serbian. In Darfur, government-backed militias were accused of using mass rape to humiliate the non-Arab groups. But this is different. The women are not simply abused and discarded. ISIS and Boko Haram are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule, subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide, according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban, another radical Islamic group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women. ISIS is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women, including the selling of Yazidi prisoners as slaves, is in keeping with Islamic law. Its online magazine cites Islamic writings proclaiming: \"We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah.\" The worst fate is reserved for non-Muslims, such as Yazidis, but Muslim women in areas seized by Islamists have seen disaster. From Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, a modern town until ISIS conquered it last year, women say, \"They have withheld all freedoms from us\" and describe oppressive, fear-filled lives. The brutality of the new jihadis is more than mere sadism. If it is madness, it is madness with a method.

The treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy, which is part of a larger plan of building a \"caliphate,\" a Sharia-ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century. Captures of women are a part of this strategy, using them as slaves and wives, and forcing them to convert to Islam. This is a stark change from the previous generation of jihadis, when Osama bin Laden headed al Qaeda.

Human Rights Watch has confirmed that ISIS forces engage in organized rape, sexual slavery, and forced marriage, which are considered war crimes and may be crimes against humanity. Similarly, Boko Haram has kidnapped thousands of women and girls, forcing them to convert and preparing them for marriage to jihadis. This approach is a stark change from previous generations of jihadis, who did not prioritize the establishment of a caliphate. However, for ISIS and Boko Haram, women are seen as indispensable for building a functioning community, even if they are viewed as the property of men. The systematic capture, assault, and subjugation of women is not only a way to humiliate the enemy but also a tactic of ethnic cleansing.

Landing them upright on a platform floating in the ocean? Well, that's never been done before. SpaceX, the private space exploration company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, hopes to give it a try. But weather forced it to scrub Monday's plan to launch. SpaceX said on Twitter that Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET will be the next opportunity for the company to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed cargo spacecraft called Dragon on a flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. That will be the easy part. After the launch, SpaceX will try to guide the bottom stage of the rocket upright onto a platform, or what it calls an autonomous spaceport drone ship, in the Atlantic Ocean off Florida. Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one? Musk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\" SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. The company has previously said the odds of a successful landing are about 50%. If you want to see how it goes, it will post photos online throughout the mission and will put video on YouTube. And if the landing doesn't work? SpaceX says it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground. What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea. The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"SpaceX, the private space exploration company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, is intending to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying uncrewed cargo spacecraft, called Dragon, on a flight to the International Space Station.

But they haven't reached a verdict yet. The jurors sent out two questions, which are scheduled to be addressed when they return to court Wednesday morning. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty. On Monday, the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15, 2013. At one point, prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg. \"The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors, so he chose Patriots' Day, Marathon Monday,\" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon. Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack, was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man, Clarke said, was only following his older brother. \"If not for Tamerlan, it would not have happened,\" Clarke argued. Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court. Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial. Bill Richard, father of bomb victim Martin Richard, 8, craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \"chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston,\" Chakravarty said. \"He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks, and he targeted those civilians: men, women and children.\" The lawyer waited a beat. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\" The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, in the marathon crowd. The day of the bombings, Chakravarty said, \"they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.\" Tsarnaev is accused of 30 counts, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase. That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor. Since testimony began March 4, federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. \"He was there,\" Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life. Jurors were shown a photo of Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of Martin Richard. \"These children weren't innocent to him,\" the prosecutor said. \"They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do.\" Chakravarty quoted Martin's father who earlier testified, \"I guess we were just unlucky that day.\" But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said. \"This was a cold, intentional, terrorist act,\" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended, he said, \"to make a point. To tell America, 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' \" The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother. \"In the past few weeks, we have come face to face with tragedy, suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine,\" Clarke said. \"We've heard words, we've heard screams and we've heard cries. For this suffering and pain, there is no excuse.\" She acknowledged her client participated in a \"senseless act.\" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, a Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad, and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has maintained. During the 15-minute rebuttal period, prosecutor William Weinreb told jurors not to be distracted by the defense's \"attempt to point the finger at somebody else.\" \"There should be no doubt in your mind that the defendant and his brother are equally guilty,\" he said. They were \"partners in crime.\" Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing, Tsarnaev went to the grocery store. \"Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb, you have to be different from other people,\" the prosecutor said. \"If you are capable of such hate, such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk, can you really blame it on your brother?\" The radicalization of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. From the start, prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19, 2013, were vividly brought to life once again. They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders, who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos. The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides. According to testimony, Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker, explosive powder from fireworks, duct tape, nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant manager. Twelve seconds later, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second, similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant, slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy, Martin Richard, and Lingzi Lu, 23, a graduate student from China. Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims:. Martin's 69-pound body \"was shattered, broken, eviscerated, burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed.\" Lu \"received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open, and she bled out.\" Campbell died in less than a minute from \"massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded.\" Sean Collier, the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings, \"never had a chance.\" He was shot between the eyes. \"They assassinated him.\" The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officer for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster. Case ends with grisly photos and testimony. Dun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers, one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown, Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries. \"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop,\" the prosecutor said Monday. \"He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.\" Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid, he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a \"manifesto\" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims, writing, \"I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\" Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers, including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan.

Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single. I did. And I do. Recently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want. \"I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom,\" 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. \"There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well.\" Jackie Demate, also 21, agreed. \"I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe.\" At first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, \"Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!\" Jackie didn't blink. \"But, Europe!\" she exclaimed. \"I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy.\" Before you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once. That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960. What a fine example my generation is! Not. Still, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29. Religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction. A study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says:  \"From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being.\" On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be \"more desirable marriage prospects.\" Bingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt. \"Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt,\" Emily Crille told me. \"That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home.\" I felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable? Perhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right. Scandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today: \"In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying.\" The article also points out that \"Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth.\" In an effort to understand the joys of \"sambo,\" the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden. \"To put it short,\" he told us, \"marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation.\" Wow. Fifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, \"I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it.\" Maybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: \"The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities.\" My Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, \"Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for.\" Marriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough. Which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point? In the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with \"I dos\"? I don't know. But I would love to know if you do.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"A recent Pew Research report found that 50% of respondents believed society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children.

As Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, took control Wednesday of the northern city of Tikrit, they found vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that might be booby-trapped. CNN senior international correspondent Arwa Damon, who was in Tikrit on Tuesday, saw a large mechanical digger packed with explosives that Iraqi forces had to disarm. The troops, she said, were cautious when they entered buildings in case they were wired to explode. Plumes of smoke rose from burning buildings in the background. Near former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces compound -- Tikrit is Hussein's birthplace -- the CNN team also saw a destroyed truck with a large machine gun mounted on the back. Iraqi forces said they had fired an RPG at the truck, killing three ISIS fighters. ISIS was ejected from the palaces compound in fierce fighting, they said, adding that there may still be booby traps. Federal police said they dismantled hundreds of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) Wednesday. CNN heard at least 16 explosions, some very loud, which police said were controlled. The potential booby traps were political as well as physical. Officials are concerned about the behavior of the conquerors, particularly the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen who helped Iraqi troops. Officials fear the militiamen might take \"scorched earth\" reprisals for the reported massacre of Shiite air force cadets by ISIS fighters in Tikrit last year. Much of the population of Tikrit is, like ISIS, Sunni Muslim. And officials fear that reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population could stoke local anger, jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit and pull the country together. Sectarian resentment helped fuel the rise of ISIS in the first place. 'Where are our sons?' demand families of soldiers captured by ISIS. Still, the liberation of Tikrit from the terrorist group, which is also known as ISIL and calls itself the Islamic State, represented a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had tried -- and failed -- to retake the city many times before. Iraqi  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi arrived Wednesday to claim the victory, which took place a year after the city was first attacked by ISIS. Al-Abadi, who is also Iraq's top military commander, had announced the previous evening on Iraqiya TV that the city was under the control of Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces continued to clean out pockets of resistance Wednesday, said Interior Minister Mohammed al-Ghabban, who was also in the city. But he said the Iraqi government would be in full control shortly. \"The enemy has been defeated, and it has lost all its capabilities,\" al-Ghabban said. \"In the coming hours, the battle will end.\" Iraqi security said that the few ISIS militants left in the city are hiding inside houses hoping to escape in the dark. ISIS' nine-month dominion over Tikrit was marked by brutality. In addition to the reported massacre of the 1,500-plus air force cadets at Camp Speicher in June, ISIS is believed to have buried victims in mass graves and to have destroyed an Assyrian church that had graced Tikrit since the eighth century. The push into Tikrit came days after U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS bases around the city. Al-Abadi said those tactics would now be replicated in other areas. Brett McGurk, the U.S. deputy special presidential envoy to the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, tweeted that the coalition's airstrikes had destroyed numerous ISIS shelters. \"We will continue to support courageous Iraqi forces operating under Iraqi command as they work to reclaim their territory from #ISIL,\" McGurk tweeted. The key to victory in Tikrit this time, the Prime Minister said, was surprise. But help from the coalition of Shiite militiamen and volunteers also played a part. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines in Iraq. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize -- Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May in an effort to retake the city. Don Melvin wrote this report in London.

The call came just before the U.N. Security Council met late Saturday morning to discuss the situation in the Arabian Peninsula nation, where Shiite rebels are pitted against external Arab air forces and fighters loyal to Yemen's displaced Sunni president. A pause was needed especially in and near the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, where intense fighting has happened in the past two weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Food, water, medical items and personnel need to get into these areas, the group said. \"Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days,\" Robert Mardini, the ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East, said. Another Red Cross official said people are running out of food, water and fuel. \"Medical supplies need to be here yesterday. The situation is difficult,\"said Marie-Claire Feghali, a spokeswoman for the ICRC who is in the capital, Sanaa. \"We need to save the lives that can be saved.\" Meanwhile, residents of Sanaa, witnessed the fiercest Saudi strikes since the air assault started last week. Military facilities, including two bases, within the city limits have been targeted, three senior security officials in Sanaa said. At the Security Council, Russia submitted a draft resolution calling for a halt to the airstrikes that a nine-country regional coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, has been conducting against the rebels in Yemen for more than a week. The meeting adjourned with no decision announced. One diplomat said the draft was missing what the envoy called key elements. It doesn't call for the Houthis to stop fighting, and it does not call for political talks between the belligerents, the diplomat told CNN on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The Houthis put Hadi under house arrest when they overtook Sanaa in January. But Hadi escaped in February, fled to Aden and declared himself to still be president. Houthis and their allies, including those loyal to Hadi's predecessor, then fought Hadi's forces in the Aden area. Hadi fled Aden in late March, ultimately for Saudi Arabia, when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city. The conflict prompted Saudi Arabia, a predominately Sunni nation and Yemen's northern neighbor, and other Arab nations to hit the rebels in Yemen with airstrikes. A Saudi source told CNN that special forces supplied weapons and communication equipment to Yemeni fighters in Aden loyal to Hadi. The Houthis were retreating from areas in the center of the city, including the presidential palace there, the source said. Saudi special forces help oppose Houthi rebels in Yemen, source says. The United Nations said Thursday that at least 519 people have been killed in Yemen in the past two weeks. An additional 1,700 have been wounded. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Somalia and Djibouti. In Aden alone, fighting has killed 58 people and injured 200 more in the past two days, Yemeni security officials said. At least 24 of the dead were Houthis. Complicating matters in Yemen is that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- not the Houthis or Hadi-loyal forces -- holds sway in the country's east. AQAP is considered one of the most ruthless branches of the terrorist organization. Also late this week, photos circulating on social media purported to show senior al Qaeda leader Khaled Batarfi  -- whom Yemeni defense officials said militants busted out of jail on Thursday -- posing in a presidential residence in southern Yemen. Sunni Islamist fighters freed Batarfi with some 270 prisoners when they overran the town of al Mukallah. On Saturday, the French military evacuated 44 people, including some French nationals, from the eastern Yemeni port city of Balhaf. CNN's Don Melvin, Trey Haney, David Shortell and Richard Roth contributed to this report.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The International Committee of the Red Cross has called for a 24 hour ceasefire in Yemen, in order to help the wounded and those in desperate need of supplies, including food and water.  As we reported last week, the country is descending into chaos; fighting has intensified and air strikes have increased.  In particular, the southern port of Aden has been the focus of heavy fighting over the past few weeks, where the Red Cross says that many more people will die if aid does not come soon.  At the same time, the Russian Government has submitted a draft resolution to the United Nations calling for a halt to air strikes.  The United Nations has said that at least 519 people have died in Yemen over the past two weeks, and that an additional 1,700 have been wounded.  Tens of thousands have fled the country.\"\n\n\t\tAnnotations:\n\n\t\t\tNo Hallucinated Spans Identified by Annotator\n\n\tSummary (2): \"The Red Cross has called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen, stating that many more people will die if they do not receive medical attention soon.

I sincerely apologize,\" Patrick Cherry told WNBC's Jonathan Dienst. Cherry, an NYPD detective assigned to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force with top-secret security clearance, faces suspension, reassignment or loss of his clearance after the video of the altercation went viral. \"I was just angry, at that moment, for that exchange.\" Cherry said. \"If the conversation initially went differently, we probably would have shook hands at the end of that encounter.\" The altercation began Monday when the Uber driver gestured to a detective in an unmarked car to use his blinker after he was allegedly attempting to park without using it, according to Sanjay Seth, a passenger in the car who uploaded the video to YouTube. The video picks up seconds after the detective began yelling at the driver and mocking his accent, and also shows the unmarked car with lights flashing pulled over behind the Uber car. In the video, the detective tells the driver he has committed \"three traffic and law violations\"  and then becomes irate and uses expletives toward the comparably calm driver. A visibly upset Police Commissioner William Bratton on Wednesday said the detective was placed on modified assignment pending an investigation. \"No good cop can watch that without a wince,\" he told reporters. \"As all good cops know ... the officer made their jobs a little bit harder. That kind of anger like that is unacceptable in any encounter; discourtesy like that and language like that is unacceptable. That officer's behavior reflected poorly on everyone who wears our uniform.\" Cherry also apologized to the police commissioner, saying \"he's doing a lot of good work to strengthen community relations in the city and I set that back. I would work, personally work to fix that.\" \"You can't judge three minutes of a tape involving me and me alone as indication that that's the kind of practice of the New York City Police Department,\" he added. Bratton, who said the detective was on duty at the time, issued an apology to the driver and passengers. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters at an unrelated news conference that he had not seen the video. \"There's just no place for any public servant to use discriminatory or negative language,\" he said. \"Obviously, our police play a particularly sensitive role and need to show respect for all people.\" In a statement, Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, called the officer \"a person of good character and an excellent detective\" who \"should not be judged by one isolated incident.\" \"I am not trying to minimize the significance of what occurred,\" Palladino said. \"I am simply pointing out that cops are just like everyone else. They have families, friends and other things going on in their lives, too, that may affect their behavior at times. There is no disputing that we are held to a higher standard, that is why this incident is so newsworthy.\" In the video, after the detective steps back to his car, the Uber driver, who moved to America less than two years ago, turns to the passenger and thanks him for recording the video. \"That's crazy. That's really inappropriate,\" the passenger tells the driver. \"Listen, it's not your fault. He shouldn't be slamming your car door, throwing things around. He doesn't have a right to open your door.\" When the detective comes back, he is irate and doesn't allow the driver to speak. \"I don't care what you have to say, people are allowed to park their cars on the side of the street without your interference,\" the detective tells the driver. \"I don't know where you're coming from, where you think it's appropriate in doing that. That's the way it works.\" \"I've got news for you,\" the detective says, \"the only reason you're not in handcuffs and going to jail and getting summons in the precinct is because I have things to do. That's the only reason that's not happening. Because this isn't important enough for me. You're not important enough. Don't ever do that again.\" The NYPD said the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident. \"The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident. We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs,\" Uber said Tuesday. Seth met Wednesday with an investigator from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, according to board spokeswoman Linda Sachs. The investigator is attempting to interview the driver as well as the police officer. The findings will be presented to the board, which will make an official determination on whether misconduct was committed, Sachs said. The board will either refer the decision to the NYPD with a disciplinary recommendation, or decide to bring up the officer on administrative charges, with the decision presented to the police commissioner.

The announcement was made by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on October 12, 2023.\nOn average, Social Security retirement monthly benefits will grow by more than $50 starting in January 2024.

As a result, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax (taxable maximum) will increase to $168,600 in 2024, up from $160,200 in 2023.\nThe annual COLA is tied to the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, as determined by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This article will provide a clear, no-nonsense assessment of Xanax's role in anxiety treatment, dispelling any exaggerations that might have taken root in popular belief.\nThe Xanax Dilemma: Unraveling the Myths\nXanax, also known by its generic name alprazolam, is commonly prescribed to alleviate symptoms of anxiety. However, its effectiveness has been a subject of debate in medical circles.\nUnderstanding Xanax's Mechanism of Action\nXanax belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which work by enhancing the effects of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. This leads to a calming effect, reducing excessive brain activity that can contribute to anxiety.\nThe Short-Term Soother\nXanax is known for its rapid onset of action, providing quick relief for acute anxiety episodes. This makes it a valuable tool in emergency situations or for short-term use.\nThe Tolerance Conundrum\nOne of the primary concerns with Xanax is the potential for tolerance development. Over time, the body may become accustomed to the medication, necessitating higher doses for the same effect. This can lead to a cycle of increasing dosage, which poses risks for dependence and withdrawal symptoms.\nLong-Term Considerations\nFor chronic anxiety management, other treatment options like therapy, lifestyle modifications, or alternative medications may be more sustainable. Long-term Xanax use requires careful monitoring and should be complemented with strategies to address the root causes of anxiety.\nConclusion: A Balanced Perspective\nWhile Xanax can be an effective tool for managing acute anxiety, it's important to approach its use with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Understanding its benefits and limitations allows individuals to make informed decisions about their mental health treatment.\nIn the broader context of anxiety management, a holistic approach that incorporates various strategies is often the key to long-term well-being. Remember, no single solution fits all, and seeking professional advice is crucial in navigating the complexities of anxiety treatment.\nAttribution\nMedical News Today\nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/xanaxs-effectiveness-for-treating-anxiety-may-be-exaggerated\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Xanax, medically known as alprazolam, is widely used to treat anxiety.

As a result of this privileged motion, the vote on whether Santos will remain in Congress will occur during a legislative session this coming week. For his part, Santos has already indicated that he will not be resigning.\nDespite the call for his removal, George Santos might be spared by Republican leadership in Congress due to the tight majority Republicans hold over Democrats, which is only 221 to 212. Indeed, alternatives to the vote for the Republican leadership include tabling the measure or to even refer it to a committee. Even if these options are not considered, it is possible Santos might be spared expulsion simply due to the need to attain 290 votes for the motion to pass. Even if all Democrats vote as such, there would still need to be 78 Republicans that disregard their leadership's desire to maintain as many Republican seats as they can in the House.

It meant consecutive challenges within a single cycle.\nEverything would reset at a Tribal Council. If there were no Reward Challenges, the same people could sit out (technically) consecutive Immunity Challenges.\nThe game was sped up to be completed in 26 days (rather than the old 39-day length). This meant less time to battle for rewards.\nIt also created a situation where one person frequently sat out.\nJeff Probst explains the new sit-out rules\n“You cannot sit out of back-to-back challenges, period. So, whoever sits out of this challenge will run in the next challenge. Make sense?” Jeff told the Survivor 45 castaways during Episode 2.\nIt makes sense. And it should alleviate any future questions. Simplifying the rule also makes it easier for Survivor fans (at home) to understand.\nDuring the 39-day seasons, episodes typically featured two challenges. That made it easier to notice when someone was sitting out too often. An adjustment to the rule was needed when the seasons became shortened.\nClaire Rafson from Survivor 44 forced this rule change\nSurvivor fans saw Claire sit out three consecutive Immunity Challenges during Season 44.\nIt led to pushback from fans and her fellow tribe members.\nAs previously reported on Monsters and Critics, Claire sitting out became a hot topic on social media. It also led to Jeff addressing the situation during his On Fire podcast.\nThe podcast has returned this fall, accompanying episodes of the reality competition show on Wednesdays.\nNew Survivor episodes are 90 minutes long, providing additional footage for fans to enjoy.\nHopefully, the producers keep this format for future seasons. For now, it is seen as a consequence of the Hollywood strikes. Those strikes have limited production for shows like NCIS and Fire Country.\nHannah Rose spoke about why she quit Survivor 45. She provided her reasoning for asking the Lulu Tribe to vote her out at the first Tribal Council.\nSocial media has not been kind to Hannah following her elimination. Fans still debate whether or not she took a spot from someone else.\nRecently eliminated castaway Brandon Donlon also spoke about his experience. Brandon shared a goal he completed on Survivor 45. He also talked about suffering a panic attack and blacking out.\nPrevious episodes from Survivor 45 are available for streaming on Paramount+.\nSurvivor airs Wednesday at 8/7c on CBS.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Survivor host Jeff Probst has clarified the show's new sit-out rule, stating that castaways are not allowed to sit out of back-to-back challenges.

Miami is certainly going to have some serious questions and decisions to make regarding their cap situation in the future, but if they were willing to sign Indianapolis Colts running back Jonathan Taylor to a lucrative contract, they certainly could do so with Young, and perhaps it may be a bit cheaper.\nBringing Young to a rush that includes Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelen Phillips, and Bradley Chubb would certainly boost the line's potency as they prepare for a playoff push.\nMiami has struggled generating sacks this season, so adding Young would go a long way into boosting that number, and helping other areas of the defense as well.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The Miami Dolphins are reportedly considering a trade for Chase Young or Montez Sweat from the Commanders.

The victim, according to GBI officials, has been identified as Chong Un Kim, a 26-year-old individual who immigrated to the United States from Korea in 1981 and resided in Hinesville, Liberty County, Georgia.\nAccording to the GBI, investigators were called upon by the Jenkins County Sheriff's Office to assist in a death investigation in 1988. The victim was found wrapped in plastic and duct tape inside a large nylon suitcase, which had been placed in a dumpster just north of Millen, Georgia, according to officials. Tragically, per the GBI, the victim had been deceased for approximately four to seven days, with the cause of death determined to be asphyxiation.\nGBI officials stated that throughout the investigation, efforts to identify the victim included the comparison of fingerprints and dental records with missing persons nationwide. Additionally, a forensic artist created a sketch of the victim, which was shared with the public.\nNational organizations such as the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NAMUS) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) joined the efforts, disseminating a computer-generated sketch. Although DNA technology evolved over the years, previous submissions to the GBI Crime Lab failed to provide profiles eligible for entry into the CODIS DNA Database, per an official statement from the GBI.\nAccording to officials, in 2023, the GBI initiated collaboration with Othram, Inc., a Texas-based company specializing in advanced DNA testing to solve cases. Through advanced DNA analysis, a genealogical search generated investigative leads, eventually leading to the identification of Chong Un Kim. The GBI stated they notified Kim's family about the breakthrough in October 2023, marking a significant development in the case.\nNotably, per GBI officials, the DNA testing was funded by \"Project Justice.\"\nThe GBI is now appealing to anyone who may have known Chong Un Kim or possesses information related to the case to contact them at 912-871-1121.

In the short term, the Pentagon has indicated that this means that the Chinese navy \"...will have the ability to conduct long-range precision strikes against land targets from its submarine and surface combatants using land-attack cruise missiles...\" which in turn will enhance China's power projection capabilities wherever China deploys these submarines.\nThe significance of these new submarines goes back to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union itself engaged in the development of similarly armed submarines to specifically target the aircraft carriers of the United States. Given widespread concerns that China might well be considering an invasion of Taiwan given the preoccupation of the United States with the war ongoing between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the potential for the outbreak of a regional war in the Middle East as the result of the conflict continuing to unfold between Israel and Hamas, the fact that these submarines are coming into service in the Chinese navy now is something the military of the United States is likely observing closely.\nUnfortunately, the recent report by the Pentagon regarding developments in the Chinese military offer additional causes of concern beyond the additional of these new submarines to the Chinese navy. Other things mentioned include a projection of nearly 1000 nuclear warheads being operation by 2030, up from a count of 500, as well as the construction of new silo fields that could host more than 300 new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos. There was even commentary on how China might well be exploring the possibility of developing conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems that would allow strikes against the United States. With all these developments occuring simultaneously with the continued expansion of the Chinese navy, already the largets in the world by number of ships and submarines at 370, to an estimated 435 by 2030, the simulated attack operations and rhetoric coming from China aginst Taiwan should be taken seriously going forward.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"China has launched its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines, enabling long-range precision strikes against land targets, according to the Pentagon.

Sadly, nothing has been revealed about Wardi besides her physical attributes that could help her identify.\nWardi is listed as an endangered missing person, but it is also unclear why the police decided on that classification.\nAt the time of her disappearance, Wardi McDonald stood 5 feet 3 to 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 120 to 130 pounds.

This support coincided with the General Assembly's passage of legislation backed by Harmon, which aimed to change the property tax assessment of private, for-profit nursing homes in Cook County.\nThe legislation would reclassify these nursing homes as residential property, lowering their property taxes by millions. In contrast, they are currently classified as commercial property in Chicago and inner-ring suburbs, subjecting them to higher real estate taxes.\nHarmon has not provided a statement regarding the contributions or his stance on the legislation. However, his spokesman, John Patterson, emphasized that legislative decisions are made in the best interests of the public and to ensure fairness for all organizations.\nRon Nunziato, the senior director of policy and regulatory affairs at the Health Care Council, defended Harmon, noting his long-standing support for nursing homes. He claimed there was no direct link between the campaign contributions and Harmon's position on the legislation.\nThe controversy emerged in May when State Sen. Celina Villanueva filed an amendment that included the tax reclassification for Cook County nursing homes. While Patterson stated that Harmon's legislative staff was involved in drafting the provision, Villanueva didn't return calls.\nDespite the controversy, the legislation passed the General Assembly and was sent to Governor J.B. Pritzker, who used an amendatory veto to remove the nursing home provision. Pritzker argued that the tax break would shift the financial burden onto suburban Cook County homeowners and small businesses, potentially causing financial hardships and foreclosure.\nThe Health Care Council and nursing homes in Cook County are now seeking legislative support for an override of the governor's veto. While it's unclear whether Harmon supports this move, a source familiar with the process indicated strong support from his Senate chief of staff, Jacob Butcher.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Illinois Senate President Don Harmon has come under fire for supporting a bill that would provide significant property tax breaks to nursing homes in Cook County.

No action is needed.” Spanish-speaking users can expect the notification to read: “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Emergencia. No se necesita acción.”\nThat Familiar Tone: A Blast from the Past\nJeremy Edwards, FEMA's spokesperson, stated that the alert will be the very same audio tone familiar to countless Americans. Rooted in history, this unique sound dates back to 1963, established by President John F. Kennedy, marking the inception of the original Emergency Broadcast System.\nInterestingly, this tone isn't just for nationwide alerts. Over 1,700 local, state, territorial, and tribal authorities use this very sound for localized emergency alerts.\nWhy The Test?\nThe main aim of these tests is to evaluate the effectiveness of FEMA's alert systems. Conducted once every three years, the last test was as recent as Aug. 11, 2021. A potential reschedule is in the cards for Oct. 11, should there be severe weather or significant events.\nWho Will Get the Message?\nWhile the majority will receive the alert, there are exceptions. Phones that are off, set to airplane mode, or not within cell tower coverage might not get the alert. Additionally, some older phones might miss out, especially if the user is on a call.\nA Word of Caution\nIt's vital to differentiate real alerts from casual references. The FCC recently proposed a hefty fine for FOX, resulting from the inappropriate use of EAS tones during an NFL promo segment. The intent is clear: these tones have a unique purpose, and its sanctity must be preserved.\nIn conclusion, come Wednesday, when that familiar tone sounds, remember it's a test.

U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour handed down this severe punishment, including one life sentence for directing a continuing criminal enterprise and three additional life sentences for drug conspiracy. Jacobo was also sentenced to four years on 21 counts of unlawful use of a communication facility, with all sentences to be served concurrently.\nJacobo, based in Bakersfield, California, orchestrated and directed multiple methamphetamine conspiracies that spanned Oklahoma and Missouri for over five years. His operations involved coordinating with more than a dozen individuals in California, Northeast Oklahoma, and Southwest Missouri.\nUsing Mexican sources of supply, Jacobo managed the distribution of methamphetamine, controlling pricing, methods of delivery, and payments. From 2016 to 2021, he received bulk shipments of meth in California and oversaw the transportation of the drugs to Oklahoma and Missouri, sometimes in quantities as large as 200 pounds. Cash proceeds were sent back to California, either driven by co-conspirators or mailed in sums of up to $100,000 from Oklahoma.\nThree distinct drug conspiracies were operated by Jacobo's regional managers in Oklahoma, each selling methamphetamine under his direction. Numerous pieces of evidence, including communications and money exchanges related to the conspiracies, were presented during the trial, along with evidence from executed search warrants.\nOne significant discovery came when law enforcement uncovered 231 pounds of methamphetamine and over $465,000 in a storage unit in Grove, Oklahoma, in 2020. The storage unit was rented for Jacobo to store meth for distribution. In addition, officers arrested a codefendant, Tony Garcia, who was carrying 30 pounds of meth and a loaded handgun in Oklahoma City. Text messages on Garcia's phone indicated that he received instructions from Jacobo on the meth distribution.\nJacobo's conviction was the result of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Operation \"Pullin Chains,\" led by the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Drug Enforcement Administration. This operation targeted high-level drug traffickers and criminal organizations, employing a multi-agency approach to disrupt and dismantle these networks.\nSOURCE\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"California drug kingpin Luis Alfredo Jacobo has been sentenced to four life terms in federal prison for orchestrating methamphetamine conspiracies across Oklahoma and Missouri for over five years.

A few reports also came from North Dakota and as far south as Omaha, Nebraska.\nUnlike past Earthbound CMEs that hit early this year and were heavily reported about, this one had slower solar wind speeds and wasn't projected to be as strong.

His district covers part of El Paso, Del Rio, and Eagle Pass which have been some of the highest crossing points for migrants crossing the southern border.\nOn Fox 4, Representative Morales spoke to Steven Dial on the migrant crisis. The Democratic Representative said President Joe Biden was not doing enough to support border states as migrants continue to cross the border.\nEarlier this year, President Biden passed several immigration laws to get a better handle on migrants crossing the border. But this year, the numbers are almost as high as last year’s record numberaccording to Customs and Border Protection.\nThe final number for this fiscal year has not been released, but according to Border Protection, migrant encounters were about 100,000 short of surpassing last year’s record number of 2,378,944 migrants.\nIn the interview, Representative Morales came up with the idea that migrants should pay the U.S. $2,000 to enter the country.\nAccording to Yahoo News, Representative Morales said:\n\"We can have these workforce agreements between a governor in Mexico and the governor of Texas. We need 100 laborers, let's say in Uvalde for some crop picking, they can do a joint cooperation agreement where they send them over here for a period of time and they're paying again, they're gainfully employed. The employers are taken care of also so that they don't get into any criminal conduct and employing these sorts of migrants. And it's a win-win situation for everyone.”\n“Just as an example, we had 1,600 crossings daily that were taking place in the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector alone. If we were to charge $2,000 for that initial processing fee and for them to get a non-voting ID card with an RFID chip in there, that would serve also as a credit card for them, we would be able to generate $3.2 million a day and over $1.2 billion annually just in the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector.\"\nYou can watch the interview with Representative Morales below:\nDo you think charging migrants $2,000 is a win-win for the country?\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Texas Representative Eddies Morales proposed that migrants should pay $2,000 to enter the US in order to support border states.

The suspect's vehicle was spotted outside the Census Bureau, which is in Suitland, Maryland. A guard apparently approached the vehicle and saw two people arguing. That guard was then shot at least once in the upper body, said Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Mark Brady. The guard was in extremely critical condition, according to Brady. The police chief said the suspect then fled the scene. Officers picked up the chase, and the suspect fired gunshots at multiple locations, Lanier said. The chase ended in a crash on Washington's busy H Street. A shootout ensues, Lanier said. An officer and the suspect were wounded, according to the police chief. Both were conscious and talking when they left the scene. \"Right now, we have every reason to believe that the car that we have in this last incident here is the same car involved and the same person involved in the kidnapping,\" she said.

The department said in its latest update that 131 people came down with the B3 strain, and five who had a different genotype than the outbreak strain. Of the 131 cases, the state was able to obtain the vaccination status for 81 patients. Of the 81, 70% were unvaccinated. \"Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak,\" Smith said.

Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on its website that 19 different strains have been discovered since 1990. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.

The cockpit is our \"safe\" place. The flight deck is a structured world of black and white. Checklists. Procedures. Standardization. Stress from the job is an accepted part of our career. However, sometimes during the course of an airline pilot's career, or anyone's career for that matter, stress issues may manifest as depression. Depression is treatable. And for airline pilots, it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood. The Federal Aviation Administration now approves certain prescribed medication, allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor. As the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression. He reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems, an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness. But Lubitz's illness didn't just appear out of thin air.  Its effects had to be apparent to others. Lubitz's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course. Considering the hoops Lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a Germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed. To what hoops am I referring? First, let's start with his passion for gliders. Glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation. Although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor, the sport involves teamwork. Interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety. I'm a glider pilot. Participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot. Behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent. Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment. The selection process is most likely highly competitive, requiring above-average aptitude. Is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed? Regardless, the process had to be a stressful experience. Opinion: Germanwings and the stigma of mental illness. Once accepted into the flight program, a rigorous training period began. For primary training, Lufthansa utilizes an ab initio (from the beginning) program based at a facility the airline owns in Goodyear, Arizona, near Phoenix. The training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license, or MPL, recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers. Countries that don't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license. Airline pilots in the United States are not licensed in this manner, requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot. This is a fairly recent change in FAA regulations, initiated as a result of the 2009 Colgan Airlines crash in Buffalo, New York. Lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror. As a 21-year-old flight instructor, I had that much flight time; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience. As with all of the MPL programs, the training involves an intense period of airline-specific instruction. And to add insult to injury, candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride. Regardless, the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about $76,000. Using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training. It is a period of almost constant supervision. Aside from observing and checking performance criteria, wouldn't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment? And wouldn't a fellow trainee have noticed also? According to reports, Lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior. Was that not in and of itself a red flag?  Wouldn't a manager in Lufthansa's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues? After all, the selection process was most likely highly competitive, with other qualified candidates readily available. Once the primary training in Arizona was complete, Lubitz would have returned to Germany and completed more specific schooling on the Airbus A320 he was about to fly. Again, no one observed issues. But even more curious, according to reports, Lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to Lufthansa. Over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues. Even if we have never flown with a particular individual, experience allows us the intuition to know when something isn't quite right. That determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines, or perhaps through a simple conversation. In that regard, I find it difficult to believe that none of Lubitz's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time. As supplemental background, Germanwings had been established as the low-cost, alter ego carrier of Lufthansa. Depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier. In addition, more days on duty were part of a Germanwings crew member's schedule. Apparently as late as March 20, Lufthansa pilots had been on strike, one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires. Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz's absence. Regardless, all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27-year-old man. The world knows the end result. It just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen. Could it have been prevented? Well, this is the primary purpose of accident investigation: Never allow the same tragedy to occur again.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Depression is a serious matter and is not to be taken lightly; however, it is now possible for airline pilots to continue flying while being treated for depression, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) now approves certain prescribed medications. This news comes as the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 who had severe psychiatric issues. There is curiosity as to how Lubitz's mental illness was not detected during his training and career, despite the rigorous selection process and training period. In the United States, airline pilots require up to 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot, but Lubitz had only a little over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act. The MPL programs involve an intense period of airline-specific instruction, which includes constant supervision. It would seem likely that at least one instructor or fellow trainee would have noticed Lubitz's behavioural issues. Lubitz also took a leave from his training, which is considered an unusual behaviour, and should have been a red flag. Lubitz even disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to Lufthansa, yet he was still allowed to fly.

The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, \"I'm losing my breath.\" Police appear on video saying, \"F*ck your breath,\" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was \"very concerned\" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, \"Taser, Taser,\" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing. On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. \"We are sorry Eric was taken from you,\" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look.

Officers arrived at the scene, opened a duffel bag and found human remains. After that discovery, police say, a surveillance video led them to an apartment building, where more body parts were discovered in a common area. That location is near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters. The remains at both locations belonged to the same victim, identified Monday as Jonathan Camilien, 26.

Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse. The case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims' anonymity. Finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he'd also faced. He was put on two years' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine, according to the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney's Office. Two charges against his diocese were dropped. At the time of his conviction, Finn said, according to CNN affiliate KCTV: \"I truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused.\" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said the conviction and penalty, which included starting a $10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse, would have positive ramifications. \"We can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities,\" Baker said. The case against Finn revolved around his diocese's dealings with Shawn Ratigan, an Independence, Missouri, priest who pleaded guilty in August 2012 to five child pornography charges. Church officials found disturbing images on Ratigan's computer but didn't notify police until nearly five months later, prosecutors said. In those interceding months, the priest kept on working. And Finn kept his job as bishop, even after his 2012 conviction. The official website of the Catholic diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph still listed him as its bishop Tuesday morning. Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who took over the abuse-shaken Boston archdiocese and has become one of the Pope's point men in the United States, has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who wouldn't be allowed to teach Sunday school was still running an American diocese. \"It's a question that the Holy See needs to address urgently,\" O'Malley said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview in November. \"There's a recognition of that ... from Pope Francis.\" Candida Moss -- a professor at Notre Dame, a Catholic university in Indiana -- said it \"doesn't look very urgent\" that a decision came down only now, nearly three years after the conviction and five months after O'Malley's comments. Several factors may have played a role in the delay, including views from lawyers or power players at the Vatican, who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who don't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities. But the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after Francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in Chile, Juan Barros, despite protesters' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there. \"It kind of shook Francis' reputation,\" said Moss. \"Having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this, especially in the U.S., I think this is a typical Francis way to reinstall confidence.\" Now that the case has been addressed, the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese has a new leader: Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann. Under the Pope's directive, Naumann will be the Kansas City diocese's apostolic administrator, in addition to his regular responsibilities in Kansas, until a permanent bishop is appointed, according to an announcement on the diocese's website. \"I pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the Diocese,\" Naumann said in an open letter to parishioners. \"All of us, who are privileged to serve in leadership for the Church, do so for only a season. It is not our Church, but Christ's Church.\" Moss, the Notre Dame professor, predicted that the shuffling at the western Missouri diocese will be \"very well received,\" though some may question why it took so long. \"It's not just that it's late,\" Moss said, \"but it's that Francis could have been more explicit.\" To that point, the co-director of BishopAccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the Vatican's one-line announcement that Francis accepted the resignation \"in accordance with ... Canon Law.\" Anne Doyle, from the watchdog group that documents the Catholic church's abuse crisis, called Finn's removal \"a good step but just the beginning.\" \"The pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice -- that it signals a new era in bishop accountability,\" Doyle said. \"... What no pope has done to date is publicly confirm that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to make children's safety his first priority. We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately.\" CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, following his conviction that he failed to report child abuse in his diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri.

Now, the tiny settlement of Tristan da Cunha is seeking the help of architects and designers the world over to secure its future well into the 21st century. With the help of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the UK overseas territory is holding an international competition to improve aging infrastructure and make the island self-sustainable as it approaches the 200th anniversary of its settlement. As a sign of just how removed Tristan da Cunha is from the rest of the world, there are only seven family names on the islands. Those who live there are mainly the descendants of Dutch, American and Italian sailors as well as 19th century British explorers. There are also a handful of expatriate Brits. But watching hit TV series \"Lost\"or reading up on William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\" won't be required research for competition entrants. Instead, those with experience of renewable energy in remote regions, modern housing and developing cost-effective agrarian systems are encouraged to apply. \"The competition is looking at enhancing the built environment on the island (and) making all structures more energy efficient,\" the island's administrator, Alex Mitcham told CNN when visiting the UK recently. Mitcham explained that most existing homes and public buildings on Tristan da Cunha are small, bungalow-type structures made from made from a mix of concrete and local volcanic rock. Few have simple insulation that can lead to energy savings while the infrastructure for things like renewable power generation and internet provision remain limited. The island is also only accessible by sea 60-days-a-year through a small port in its only town, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. According to James Porter of RIBA Competitions, contestants will have to factor in irregular design questions such as \"how can we get the material ashore and how can we actually think of ways that we can put things together once there?\" \"There are limitations on the amount of cargo that can be trans-shipped,\" he added. In total, Tristan da Cunha is made up of four islands. Tristan is the largest land mass and the only one to house people. Two more unpopulated islands, Nightingale and Inaccessible, lie close by. A third, Gough, is situated roughly 230 miles away. Both Gough and Inaccessible are UNESCO World Heritage sites. The closest mainland port is Cape Town, South Africa, some seven days sailing time and 1,750 miles north-east. Tristan already has a pub, shop, cafe, dance hall, museum, catholic church and swimming pool. There are also two expatriate doctors, two Tristanian nurses and school teachers with some 30 students of varying ages. The island's main industry is lobster fishing, with exports reaching as far afield as the U.S., Australia, Japan and the EU thanks to a fishing company that has exclusive rights to fish in the surrounding waters. Tristan earns additional income from the sale of unique stamps, coins and handicraft souvenirs, Mitcham explained. Modest revenue also flows from tourism and visitor accommodation. \"As it is the remotest inhabited island in the world, the Tristanians are already very self sufficient, being able to produce many of their own foodstuffs (like fish, livestock and potatoes),\" Mitcham said. However, the cost of living has increased in recent years, he added. With limited transport and communication links, the islanders are also keen to see how they can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, improve the energy efficiency of properties and reduce imports. \"We are slowly updating 40-year old infrastructure,\" Mitcham said of the last time the island experienced a major redesign. That modernization happened roughly a decade after the island was evacuated temporarily due to ongoing volcanic activity. Before that period, the main way for the islanders to communicate with the outside world was by Morse code. Things have already changed a lot since then, however. \"A new water system, electrical system and waste water system have just been completed,\" Mitcham said. \"And with the 200th Anniversary of the founding of Tristan (2016) almost upon us it is an appropriate time to look at new initiatives that may be able to help the future viability of the community.\" Interested architects have until mid-June to submit their initial ideas. The best will be whittled down to an initial 20 and then five after further analysis between June and September. Porter and Mitcham say the islanders will have to apply to the UK and possibly the EU for grants to fund the project. The winner is penciled in to be announced in June 2016. The most important aspect for applicants is to \"identify cost-effective and practical solutions to improve the energy efficiency (through renewable energy sources) of properties,\" Mitcham said \"as well as modernizing ... government structures.\"\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The tiny settlement of Tristan da Cunha is seeking worldwide help from architects and designers to ensure its survival into the 21st century.

Obama's Iran diplomacy already has his conservative critics fired up, and things could get even more interesting in the week ahead. The President is headed to Panama for a regional summit, and Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports one of the big questions is whether he'll make history and have a face-to-face meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro. \"This would be the first meeting between a U.S. and a Cuban leader in decades,\" said Pace. \"But Obama's efforts to end this freeze of Cuba have been a lot more difficult than they looked when he announced it last year,\" Pace said.  \"And so what the White House is going to be weighing is whether this meeting would be a way to generate more progress or whether it would be a premature reward for the Castros.\" Hillary Clinton has leased her headquarters space in Brooklyn and will soon make her presidential campaign official. And with the launch, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reports, will come a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce Clinton -- with an emphasis on her childhood and her earlier work on children's issues. \"The Democrats around Hillary Clinton believe that while she's one of the most famous people in the world, she's never been properly introduced in her own right,\" said Martin. \"So when she does roll out her campaign here in a couple of weeks, look for more biographical touches. We'll hear about her childhood in suburban Chicago and some of the work that she did as an advocate for the Legal Services Corporation and the Children's Defense Fund when she was in her 30s, and also, more about her Arkansas days as first lady, as an advocate for education.\" A lot of the big names signing on to Team Clinton are already known. But Dan Balz of The Washington Post explains part of the statement her campaign wants to make with the announcement is to show it has a large, experienced staff ready for the key national and state roles. \"What I'm hearing is that when they launch, this staff is going to be even much, much bigger than we, at this point, imagine, that they have done a huge amount of hiring,\" said Balz. And Balz reports the planning centers on smaller events designed to highlight more personal interaction. \"She did an event with the wife of the mayor of New York earlier this week that could be a template for the kinds of things they're doing.\" Much of the media attention on the corruption indictment against Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey has been on its allegations of luxury hotel stays with girlfriends. But beyond the more tabloidesque details, Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast notes that one of the charges centers on a suggestion the senator's staff was soliciting funds for a so-called super PAC -- a violation of campaign finance laws. And she says the scrutiny of that practice might grow because of the Menendez allegations. \"I was talking to some campaign finance watchdogs this week and they say if the (Federal Election Commission) really starts to look into this, they're actually going to find some impropriety with other lawmakers much much farther than Menendez,\" said Kucinich. \"So watch for that if it starts happening.\" By a week from Monday, there will be three official GOP candidates for president: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. Others will soon follow, and as things get more official, pressure is mounting on GOP operatives to choose sides. In New Hampshire this past week, Matt Maroney, a former Mitt Romney alum with ground organizing experience, signed on with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's team. Others in the state reported calls coming in from Ohio Gov. John Kasich and, yes, even Donald Trump. This dynamic plays out on the national level, too: Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, for example, was approached both by Team Christie and by allies of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. In the end, though, Fabrizio signed on with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who makes his official announcement on Tuesday.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"President Obama's controversial foreign policy decisions are stirring up debate, with many critics stating that his diplomatic approach to Iran is misguided.

The campaign will emphasise her earlier work on children's issues, and her time as an advocate for education during her days as first lady in Arkansas.

His wife said she was still searching for answers Thursday after U.S. officials revealed the 73-year-old American aid worker had been accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda. \"We were so hopeful that those in the U.S. and Pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so, and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through,\" Elaine Weinstein said in a statement. \"We do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding Warren's death, but we do understand that the U.S. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances.\" Gunmen abducted Weinstein in 2011 from his home in Lahore, Parkistan. They posed as neighbors, offered food and then pistol-whipped the American aid worker and tied up his guards, his family said. Just a few months after Weinstein's capture, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding Weinstein -- and demanding, among other things, that the United States end airstrikes in Pakistan. U.S. officials called for his release but repeatedly said Washington wouldn't bargain with al Qaeda. Weinstein -- a husband, father and grandfather from Rockville, Maryland -- was 73 years old when he was killed, according to a family website detailing information about his case. He worked in Pakistan as a contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development from 2004 to 2011, the website says. His employer, Virginia-based consulting firm J.E. Austin Associates Inc., described him as a world-renowned development expert. \"Warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people's lives better,\" his wife said Thursday. He loved the Pakistani people and their culture, she said, learning to speak Urdu and doing \"everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region.\" As he announced Weinstein's death Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama praised what he said was Weinstein's lifelong dedication to service, first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a USAID contractor. Weinstein, Obama said, was someone who \"willingly left the comforts of home to help the people of Pakistan,\" focusing his work on helping families escape poverty to give their children a better life. \"This was a man who basically dedicated his life to service, to people in general, but especially to people in a country where the standard of living was low and difficult. ... It's tragic that he was killed the way he was,\" former U.S. Ambassador Dan Simpson said. Simpson met Weinstein in 1968 when they were both working in Burundi -- Simpson as a diplomat and Weinstein as a scholar researching several books. Weinstein \"was a very kind person,\" Simpson said, \"and someone who was very sensitive to the needs of the people who he worked with.\" Another hostage was also killed in the January operation, Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto. U.S. officials knew they were targeting an al Qaeda compound in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in the January counterterrorism operation, Obama said, but they didn't know that the hostages were also there. Both Lo Porto and Weinstein were people who \"believed passionately\" that they could make a difference, Obama said. \"There could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their al Qaeda captors,\" Obama said Thursday. \"Warren's work benefited people across faiths. Meanwhile, al Qaeda boasted to the world that it held Warren citing his Jewish faith.\" Weinstein's health had been deteriorating, Obama said. Last year daughter Alisa Weinstein told CNN her father suffered from a heart condition and severe asthma. But it was still an optimistic time for the family. That month captors released U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, and that buoyed hopes from Weinstein's family that he could also be freed. \"They have shown with this exchange that they can get this done. If they want to, they can do this,\" Alisa Weinstein said at the time. \"So I know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others.\" But a prisoner swap never happened for Weinstein, even though his family pushed for one. Al Qaeda released a video of Weinstein on Christmas 2013. He appeared gaunt and said he was suffering. \"Needless to say, I've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day, not knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and because I am not with them,\" Weinstein said in the video. At the time, a former colleague and friend said his appearance in the video was jarring. \"Quite honestly, I didn't recognize him in the picture,\" Laurie Wiseberg told CNN. \"He has changed so dramatically from the person he used to be in terms of appearance and I would hope something could be done so he has a chance to be reunited with his family, his wife, his children and grandchildren, and not have to die in a foreign country far away from those he loves.\" At the time, The Washington Post also reported that it had received a letter from Weinstein. The letter, which was also posted on the website of the SITE Intelligence group, described his background doing human rights work. The letter said that before becoming a consultant in 2003, Weinstein had worked as a college professor at the State University of New York - Oswego, as a Peace Corps country director in Togo and Ivory Coast and for USAID and the World Bank. \"I hope that the media can mount a campaign to get the American government to actively pursue my release and to make sure that I am not forgotten and just become another statistic,\" the letter said. \"Given my age and my health I don't have time on my side.\" Weinstein's wife's statement on Thursday thanked some but also blasted the governments of the United States and Pakistan for not doing more to help her husband. While Maryland members of Congress -- Rep. John Delaney, Sen. Barbara Mikulski and Sen. Ben Cardin -- and members of the FBI were \"relentless\" in efforts to free her husband, she said others in the U.S. government were \"inconsistent and disappointing over the course of 3½ years.\" \"We hope that my husband's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the U.S. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families,\" she said. Pakistani government and military officials also should have done more, she said. \"Warren's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country, but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself, instead treating Warren's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority,\" she said. \"I hope the nature of our future relationship with Pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these.\" But ultimately, she said her husband's captors are the ones responsible for his death. \"I can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of Pakistan,\" she said. \"The cowardly actions of those who took Warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with Islam and they will have to face their God to answer for their actions.\" Opinion: Could Weinstein have been saved?

Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the \"predator colleges\" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a \"debt strike,\" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, \"victim\" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, \"It's not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,\" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on \"federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions\" on potential buyers. You can't hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it's up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don't go back to school in the fall. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year; that issue has been resolved.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The US for-profit college business is a multi-billion dollar industry, however, it has been exposed as predatory and deceitful.

The closure of Corinthian Colleges comes after hundreds of its graduates joined a \"debt strike,\" refusing to pay back their loans. Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan has signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates with high levels of debt and no job prospects. It is now necessary to close down the remaining for-profit colleges and forgive the debts of students who have not found employment or transferred to reputable colleges within three years. The average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. These predatory colleges have been known to engage in rule breaking and dishonest practices, and numerous state attorneys general have been investigating them. Enrollment at the largest for-profit college, the University of Phoenix, has fallen by half.

The company was one of the \"worst predator colleges,\" which are schools that offer dubious degrees and saddle students with high levels of debt. Many for-profit colleges operate primarily online and enroll large numbers of students with questionable academic backgrounds. The closure of Corinthian will have little impact on the overall for-profit college industry, however, as there are currently over 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges across the country. Despite their poor track record, for-profit colleges remain popular among students because they offer flexible scheduling and lower tuition rates compared to traditional public universities. However, the cost of attending a for-profit college is often significantly higher than that of a comparable program at a public institution.

On Kabul's streets, you can easily find the uneasy legacy of America's longest war. Outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill NATO depended upon: they speak English. Now however, their world has turned upon them. They were, each for a different reason -- each for a reason they do not understand -- all fired from their jobs and then blacklisted, they say, meaning they can no longer get work with other government groups or NGOs here. The skill they once thrived off has left them isolated, and fearing reprisals. They sleep in market stalls, and avoid traveling to see their families in case the threats they face are visited upon them. \"My family is still living in the provinces,\" one of the men tells me. \"I cannot go there. I am living in a market, in one of the empty shops.\" Another adds: \"My family, everybody, give up on me, they are nervous.\" A third man -- all requested anonymity -- says: \"Right now I sleep here, on the street, in this mosque area.\" \"We are in prison in Afghanistan,\" a fourth says. The U.S. Embassy and NATO declined to comment for this story. EXCLUSIVE: The last Americans in Afghanistan. Helicopters still buzz around the capital. Its population is five times what it was when NATO arrived here, even by the most conservative estimates, and the violence in the provinces means people swell it further still -- arriving in Kabul's dusty, mountainous bowl of a city in order to avoid the fighting. Neighborhoods that were once massively over-priced cliques of foreigners living in \"poppy palaces\" -- villas allegedly bought from profiteers of the opium trade -- are now empty. One road, forever pot-holed in the past decade, is now being covered over by Afghans who, it seems, are finally reclaiming that street. Even Chicken Street, the hackneyed pedestrian shopping road where new Western arrivals would buy carpets or local trinkets, is more or less deserted. One shopkeeper says it could be the embassy security warnings that are keeping people away now. It is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and NGO workers. They are now empty, the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables. It is immeasurably different to three years ago when I lived there. Drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps, holding their children, hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of America's war here. Huge lines of excavators, cherry-pickers, and forklift trucks sit idle. At times it seemed there was little America wouldn't do, or try, to meets its often fluid goals in the country. Yet today, the machines that could have once moved small mountains do little more than gather dust. EXCLUSIVE: Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist. Further down the road too are more winners-turned-losers of the NATO presence here. Vast supply chains once kept 120,000 troops fed and watered. Trucks lined the roads and climbed up to the military bases. Now the bases are gone, and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still. Their bosses may have fled abroad with their winnings, yet the drivers have been left behind, stuck with vehicles that cost them $30,000 to buy -- and $1,000 a year just to keep on the road -- but that would fetch just a tenth of that price now. \"The contracts were with big businessmen and commanders who were giving us very little and made themselves very rich and are now living comfortably in Dubai,\" one truck driver tells us. Yet still the wedding palaces proliferate. Along one stretch of road their endless, multiplying lights throb. Each night the houses seem packed -- the commitment to the future still is popular here, despite the uncertainty -- even if the lights that decorate them seem more and more like a symbol of leaving. One set actually replicates the shape of an expensive hotel in Dubai. The city's lights do shine staggeringly and often constantly -- something the Taliban never achieved during their rule here. NATO's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on. The question many surely ask here -- as the last American troops prepare to retreat inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year -- is how much longer the lights will continue to glow.

It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. \"The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S.,\" Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. \"Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up.\" At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees. Southwest doesn't charge any fees, while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags, booking by phone, changing plans and more.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"A new Consumer Reports study has found that Southwest Airlines offers the most tickets for airline rewards programmes, with 11.9 million tickets available, or 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats.

The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering \"a psychotic episode\" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence \"revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,\" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as \"four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine.\" The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges. Meanwhile, victims and their relatives are challenging all media outlets \"to stop the gratuitous use of the name and likeness of mass killers, thereby depriving violent individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave,\" the No Notoriety group says. They are joined by victims from eight other mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Raised in central coastal California and in San Diego, James Eagan Holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the FICO firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother, according to the U-T San Diego newspaper. Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said. His childhood classmates remember him as a clean-cut, bespectacled boy with an \"exemplary\" character who \"never gave any trouble, and never got in trouble himself,\" The Salinas Californian reported. His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Peñasquitos, which a neighbor described as \"kind of like Mayberry,\" the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended Westview High School, which says its school district sits in \"a primarily middle- to upper-middle-income residential community.\" There, Holmes ran cross-country, played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the Salk Institute and Miramar College, which attracts academically talented students. By then, his peers described him as standoffish and a bit of a wiseacre, the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended college fairly close to home, in a neighboring area known as Southern California's \"inland empire\" because it's more than an hour's drive from the coast, in a warm, low-desert climate. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student. In 2008 he was a summer camp counselor for disadvantaged children, age 7 to 14, at Camp Max Straus, run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. He graduated from UC Riverside in 2010 with the highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. \"Academically, he was at the top of the top,\" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. He seemed destined for even higher achievement. By 2011, he had enrolled as a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, the largest academic health center in the Rocky Mountain region. The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory. Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant rewards outstanding neuroscientists who will make major contributions to neurobiology. A syllabus that listed Holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microRNA biomarkers. But Holmes struggled, and his own mental health took an ominous turn. In March 2012, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, and that he would do so \"when his life was over,\" court documents said. Holmes was \"denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor,\" according to court documents. About that time, Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton was so concerned about Holmes' behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. Holmes began to fantasize about killing \"a lot of people\" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Holmes' psychiatrist contacted several members of a \"behavioral evaluation and threat assessment\" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. At issue was whether to order Holmes held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals, the station reported. \"Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team\" in \"the first 10 days\" of June, but it \"never came together\" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, Holmes' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment. What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed. In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Police said he also booby-trapped his third-floor apartment with explosives, but police weren't fooled. After Holmes was caught in the cinema parking lot immediately after the shooting, bomb technicians went to the apartment and neutralized the explosives. No one was injured at the apartment building. Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court. The number he called can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Court documents have also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages that Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts has not been made public. According to The New York Times, Holmes sent a text message to a fellow graduate student, a woman, about two weeks before the shooting. She asked if he had left Aurora yet, reported the newspaper, which didn't identify her. No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times. He asked if she had heard of \"dysphoric mania,\" a form of bipolar disorder marked by the highs of mania and the dark and sometimes paranoid delusions of major depression. The woman asked if the disorder could be managed with treatment. \"It was,\" Holmes wrote her, according to the Times. But he warned she should stay away from him \"because I am bad news,\" the newspaper reported. It was her last contact with Holmes. After the shooting, Holmes' family issued a brief statement: \"Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,\" they said, without giving any information about their son. Since then, prosecutors have refused to offer a plea deal to Holmes. For Holmes, \"justice is death,\" said Brauchler, the district attorney. In December, Holmes' parents, who will be attending the trial, issued another statement: They asked that their son's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life, if he's found not guilty by reason of insanity. \"He is not a monster,\" Robert and Arlene Holmes wrote, saying the death penalty is \"morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill.\" \"He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness,\" the parents said. The matter will be settled by the jury. CNN's Ana Cabrera and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report from Denver.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"The trial of James Holmes, 27, who is accused of opening fire at a cinema in Colorado in 2012, has begun.

Dollar noted in a recent address to his congregants that the devil was attempting to discredit him in regards to his campaign seeking $300 from 200,000 people globally to help buy the luxury jet. In a newly posted five-minute clip on YouTube, the Atlanta-area pastor speaks to his followers at World Changers Church International, tackling his critics and allegations about tithes, his real name and reports alleging members of having to reveal their W2 statuses to come into the church's sanctuary. \"(The devil thinks) I got to discredit that man before he starts showing people Jesus!\" Dollar preaches to loud applause. \"I'm on my sabbatical, and the enemy's trying to discredit me,\" Dollar stated. Dollar is focused in the video on getting his point across and slams critics of his original request by stating to the people gathered, \"I never one time came to you and asked you for a dime for this airplane, did I?\" But in March, Dollar did appeal in a video to \"friends from around the world,\"  soliciting donations to replace his current 1984 Gulfstream G-1159A. Because of two accidents that occurred in the 31-year-old plane, Dollar and his staff have been flying commercial. \"The (critics) don't know what we do. That's why they asked the question, what does a preacher need with an airplane? If you knew what we did, then you wouldn't ask that question,\" Dollar said. \"Just because the world doesn't have it, doesn't mean that you can't.\" In March, the ministry's desire to purchase a Gulfstream G650 airplane was met with criticism on social media and was the subject of nationwide media reports. The furor came after a nearly six-minute video was uploaded on the Creflo Dollar Ministries website soliciting money for a Gulfstream G650, which sells for a reported $65 million. The page featuring the video and information on the fundraiser has been taken down, but those wishing to donate are still able to do so on the church's gift page. A Gulfstream G650 can fly 18 passengers and four crew members, according to gulfstream.com. The jet comes with two Rolls-Royce engines, high-speed Internet and two multichannel satellites and allows for a four-and-a-half-hour commute from New York to Los Angeles. \"The G650 is the biggest, fastest, most luxurious, longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far,\" according to the site. The project wasn't limited to member donations, as the site stated that \"we are asking members, partners and supporters of this ministry to assist us in acquiring a Gulfstream G650.\" In the new video, Dollar claims the church has more than 3 million supporters worldwide who want him to come to where they are. The pastor has said the two incidents involving his old plane -- including one in which a mechanical failure caused the jet to skid off a runway in London while his wife and their three daughters were aboard -- have shown him it was time to turn to God for a new airplane. Prosperity gospel is a theology that promises wealth and health to those who tithe 10% of their income to the church. Attempts to contact Dollar's ministry for comment on Thursday were unsuccessful.
