A staff member witnessed an attacker disguised in a white coat opening fire.\n7.  **Tactical Shift:** This attack marks a change in IS approach in Afghanistan. It's their first direct engagement with security forces in Kabul (previously targeting civilians/Shia gatherings) and they used a Taliban-associated tactic (blowing gates open). This suggests they may have increased resources and training.\n8.  **IS Context in Afghanistan:** IS has been active in Afghanistan for two years, mainly in the east near Pakistan, struggling to widen its base. The government claims it has rooted them out of some eastern bases but not mountainous areas. The passage notes IS's history of attacks in the region since 2015.\n9.  **Aftermath:** TV showed people hiding on window ledges.

Commandos who landed on the Sardar Daud hospital roof killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The so-called Islamic State (IS) group has claimed the attack. The Taliban has denied any involvement. More than 50 people were also wounded, the defence ministry said. World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' How successful has IS been in Afghanistan? Stuck between IS and the Taliban President Ashraf Ghani said the attack at the 400-bed hospital \"trampled all human values\". \" In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,\" he said. The attack began at 09:00 local time (04:30 GMT). One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker \"wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors\". One employee wrote on Facebook: \"Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us.\" The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital. Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month. But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks. If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months. In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks. The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control. TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building. More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies. Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to \"avenge the blood of our people\". IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks. In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people. Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30. IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"In the provided passage, a hospital in Afghanistan was attacked by militants armed with guns and grenades, who gained entry by detonating explosives at the hospital gate and opening fire on staff and patients.

They gained entry after detonating explosives at the gate and opened fire on staff and patients.\n2.  **Resolution:** Commandos landed on the hospital roof and killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting.\n3.  **Claim & Denial:** The so-called Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack. The Taliban denied any involvement.\n4.  **Casualties:** More than 50 people were wounded, according to the defence ministry.\n5.  **Condemnation:** President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, stating it \"trampled all human values\" and that hospitals are regarded as immune sites in all religions.\n6.  **Timeline & Witness:** The attack began at 09:00 local time. A staff member witnessed an attacker disguised in a white coat opening fire.\n7.  **Tactical Shift:** This attack marks a change in IS approach in Afghanistan. It's their first direct engagement with security forces in Kabul (previously targeting civilians/Shia gatherings) and they used a Taliban-associated tactic (blowing gates open). This suggests they may have increased resources and training.\n8.  **IS Context in Afghanistan:** IS has been active in Afghanistan for two years, mainly in the east near Pakistan, struggling to widen its base. The government claims it has rooted them out of some eastern bases but not mountainous areas. The passage notes IS's history of attacks in the region since 2015.\n9.  **Aftermath:** TV showed people hiding on window ledges. The interior ministry confirmed the operation ended over six hours later with all attackers dead. IS-affiliated media shared images from the attack. Deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah condemned the attack and vowed revenge.\"\n\n------\n\nProvide reasoning first, then clearly state a final classification (Inconsistent if hallucinations of any kind are present, Consistent otherwise) at the end in this format:\n\"Final classification: [Inconsistent / Consistent]\"\nIf the provided text does not summarize the article, state clearly: \"Final classification: Invalid\".\nDo not include any additional text after the final classification.\n", "evaluation_response": "The summary accurately reflects the details in the source article.

He believes Jacobson's *J* is the strongest but fears reluctance to award him again so soon after Mantel's double win.

It is the first year that the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. Former Booker winner Howard Jacobson is among three British writers, two Americans and an Australian on this year's shortlist. Also on the list are Ali Smith, Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Flanagan, who is next in the betting at 3/1. Jacobson, who won in 2010 for his comic novel The Finkler Question, is nominated for his futuristic love story J. It features two main characters who inhabit a world where the past is not spoken about and is shrouded in suspicion, referred to as \"What Happened, If It Happened\". Mukherjee's The Lives of Others begins in Calcutta in 1967, and which focuses on the secrets and rivalries within a family against a backdrop of political activism. Inverness-born Smith's How To Be Both tells two interlinking stories, one about a renaissance artist in 15th Century Italy, the other about a child of the 1960s - and the reader can decide which half to read first. She has been shortlisted twice before, with 2005's The Accidental and Hotel World in 2001. American Ferris's third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, looks at atheism through the eyes of a New York dentist, who is puzzled when someone sets up an online Facebook and Twitter account in his name. The other American is Fowler, who is nominated for We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book, narrated by a college student Rosemary, tells the story of her  family: two parents and three children - one of whom turns out to be surprisingly special. Australia's Flanagan is the only non-British representative of the Commonwealth on the shortlist. He is nominated for The Narrow Road to the Deep North, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in World War Two. Of all the shortlisted novels, Fowler's We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is by far the best-selling. Since it was published in March it has sold more than 55,000 copies, according to figures from Nielsen. The next closest is Ferris's To Rise Again at a Decent Hour with just over 6,000 sales since it was published at the end of May. The announcement of the final six on 9 September caused a sales spike for all the books on the shortlist.  Mukherjee's The Lives of Others, which sold 97 copies in the week before the announcement saw sales leap to 507 a week later. \" It's a weak list that is more notable for the novels it has omitted than for those that have made the cut,\" said David Brauner, professor of contemporary literature at the University of Reading. \" The strongest book on the list is Howard Jacobson's J, but I fear there may be some reluctance to make him a two-time winner so soon after Hilary Mantel's double win (with Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies). \" John Sutherland's mischievous (or perhaps malicious) nomination of J at the top of his list of The Top 10 Unfinishable Novels in The Guardian last week won't have helped its chances either. \" It revives the perennial debate about whether the prize should be awarded on literary merit alone or whether it should only reward what Stella Rimington called 'readable' books.\" This year marks is 46th year of the Booker Prize. The judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, consists of Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year, the Booker was won by New Zealand's Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries. At 28, she was the youngest-ever winner. The shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book.

This is the 46th year of the prize and the first year it is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality.\n2.  **Shortlist Composition:** The shortlist consists of three British writers (including former winner Howard Jacobson), two Americans, and one Australian (Richard Flanagan).\n3.  **Shortlisted Authors & Books:**\n    *   **Neel Mukherjee (British?):** *The Lives of Others* (5/2 favourite), set in 1960s Calcutta, focusing on family secrets and political activism.\n    *   **Howard Jacobson (British):** *J* (3/1 in betting), a futuristic love story set in a world where the past is taboo. He won the prize in 2010.\n    *   **Ali Smith (British):** *How To Be Both*, featuring two interlinking stories set in different centuries, allowing the reader to choose the starting point. She has been shortlisted twice before.\n    *   **Joshua Ferris (American):** *To Rise Again at a Decent Hour*, exploring atheism through a New York dentist who finds fake online accounts in his name.\n    *   **Karen Joy Fowler (American):** *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves*, narrated by a college student about her family, including a \"surprisingly special\" sibling. It is the best-selling shortlisted book (over 55,000 copies sold).\n    *   **Richard Flanagan (Australian):** *The Narrow Road to the Deep North*, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in WWII. He is the only non-British Commonwealth representative.\n4.  **Sales Information:** Fowler's novel is the best-seller (over 55,000 copies). Ferris's novel has sold just over 6,000 copies. Sales spiked for all shortlisted books after the announcement (e.g., Mukherjee's sales jumped from 97 to 507 copies per week).\n5.  **Critical Opinion:** A professor criticizes the shortlist as \"weak,\" noting notable omissions. He believes Jacobson's *J* is the strongest but fears reluctance to award him again so soon after Mantel's double win. Jacobson's book was also negatively featured in a \"Top 10 Unfinishable Novels\" list, reviving debate about judging criteria (\"literary merit\" vs. \"readable\").\n6.  **Logistics:** Shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition. The Duchess of Cornwall will present the prize. Coverage will be on the BBC News Channel and BBC Arts from 2130 BST. The judging panel is chaired by AC Grayling. Last year's winner was Eleanor Catton (*The Luminaries*), the youngest-ever winner at age 28.\"\n\n------\n\nProvide reasoning first, then clearly state a final classification (Inconsistent if hallucinations of any kind are present, Consistent otherwise) at the end in this format:\n\"Final classification: [Inconsistent / Consistent]\"\nIf the provided text does not summarize the article, state clearly: \"Final classification: Invalid\".\nDo not include any additional text after the final classification.\n", "evaluation_response": "The summary includes most of the correct details, but there are notable errors.

Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third. Extend, yes, but for just one more year. Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge. Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher. When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to \"taking an egg out of omelette\"), was a remote one. But that all changed on 23 June. Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor. If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations. Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets. And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he \"wanted to serve\" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years. But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a \"third way\" - the short extension. The reasons were personal and unique. In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs. Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system. He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week. \"To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,\" he said about whether he would extend his stay. \"No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that. \"Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors. \"Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of \"tension\" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision. Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add. Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations. But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year. By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete.

Speculation arose about whether Carney felt political pressure or was disillusioned by the economic predictions for the UK. However, the main reason for his decision was personal - his daughters would be finishing their exams in 2018, and he wanted to return to Canada and its education system. Carney's decision was not influenced by tension with the Prime Minister or criticism of the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts.

His daughters face important educational milestones (A-levels and GCSEs) in 2018, and his family planned to return to Canada then. He stated the role requires \"total attention and devotion,\" and managing his family life was the key factor.\n3.  **Rejected Factors:** The passage explicitly dismisses other possible reasons:\n    *   It was *not* due to political pressure (e.g., from the Prime Minister who wanted a longer extension).\n    *   It was *not* due to disillusionment with Brexit economic predictions or criticism of the Bank's forecasts.\n    *   It was *not* related to government policy.\n4.  **Professional Context:** While Carney recognized the professional challenge of leaving during the Brexit negotiations (expected to be underway in 2018), he only felt able to extend for one year. By 2019, the Article 50 process (formal Brexit negotiation period) should be complete.\"\n\n------\n\nProvide reasoning first, then clearly state a final classification (Inconsistent if hallucinations of any kind are present, Consistent otherwise) at the end in this format:\n\"Final classification: [Inconsistent / Consistent]\"\nIf the provided text does not summarize the article, state clearly: \"Final classification: Invalid\".\nDo not include any additional text after the final classification.\n", "evaluation_response": "The summary accurately reflects the passage without adding unsupported details. It correctly presents the one‐year extension (to 2019) as an unexpected option, explains that Carney’s decision was based solely on personal reasons—especially related to his daughters’ educational milestones and the family's timing to return to Canada—and notes that other possible explanations (political pressure, Brexit-related economic concerns, and government policy) were explicitly rejected. The detail that the Article 50 process should be complete by his departure is also consistent with the original passage. Therefore, no hallucinations are present.\n\nFinal classification: Consistent", "classification": "Consistent"}

Many journalists, broadcasters, and writers paid tribute, highlighting his unique, brilliant, and instantly recognizable writing style, calling him one of the finest writers of the time and controversial but kind.\n4.  **Controversies:** Gill's writing often caused controversy, including offensive remarks about the Welsh, the Isle of Man, Norfolk, and Clare Balding (for which he was censured), describing shooting a baboon, and being thrown out of a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.\n5.  **Personal Background:** Gill had dyslexia, dictating his copy.

Gill, who had been having chemotherapy, said that he did not \"feel cheated\" and had been \"very lucky\" in his life. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens said Gill had been \"a giant among journalists\" and the \"heart and soul\" of the paper he joined in 1993. The final column by Gill, about coming to terms with his diagnosis, will be featured in tomorrow's Sunday Times. In a statement sent to staff on Saturday, Mr Ivens said: \"It is with profound sadness that I must tell you that our much-loved colleague Adrian Gill died this morning. \" Adrian was stoical about his illness, but the suddenness of his death has shocked us all.\" He added: \"He was the heart and soul of the paper. His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion. \" Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him.\" Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had \"an embarrassment of cancer, the full English. \" There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy.\" Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a \"controversialist\" but also \"a kind man and a brilliant writer\". Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as \"the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times\". \" The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office,\" he added. Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been \"the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style\". John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique. \" In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine.\" Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: \"Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour.\" Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had \"trashed\" him for 20 years, but always did so \"with magnificently eloquent savagery\" as well as \"an irritating kernel of truth\". While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy. In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups. In 1998, he described the Welsh as \"dark, ugly little trolls\" - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as \"a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile\". In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the \"hernia on the end of England\", while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it \"smelled of boiled washing\". In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a \"dyke on a bike\". He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer. He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London. He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times. His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991. They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced. Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac. He said he had been \"surprisingly excited\" to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as \"The Blonde\" in his restaurant reviews.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"Adrian Gill, a renowned journalist and published author, passed away due to cancer.

He had previously announced being diagnosed with multiple cancers, which he described as the \"full English\" and \"an embarrassment of cancer,\" undergoing chemotherapy.\n2.  **Professional Tributes:** Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens announced Gill's death, calling him a \"giant among journalists,\" the \"heart and soul\" of the paper (joined in 1993), praising his wit, dazzling/fearless writing, intelligence, and compassion. Gill's final column, about his diagnosis, was due to be published.\n3.  **Reactions:** Gill's death caused shock and sadness. Many journalists, broadcasters, and writers paid tribute, highlighting his unique, brilliant, and instantly recognizable writing style, calling him one of the finest writers of the time and controversial but kind.\n4.  **Controversies:** Gill's writing often caused controversy, including offensive remarks about the Welsh, the Isle of Man, Norfolk, and Clare Balding (for which he was censured), describing shooting a baboon, and being thrown out of a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.\n5.  **Personal Background:** Gill had dyslexia, dictating his copy. Born in Edinburgh (1954), he attended St Christopher School, Central Saint Martins, and the Slade School. He started writing art reviews in the 1980s before joining Tatler and then the Sunday Times.\n6.  **Family:** He was married to author Cressida Connolly (1983) and later to Amber Rudd (1991, two children: Flora and Alistair), divorcing both. He was engaged to Nicola Formby (partner of 23 years, two children: twins Edith and Isaac) following his diagnosis.\"\n\n------\n\nProvide reasoning first, then clearly state a final classification (Inconsistent if hallucinations of any kind are present, Consistent otherwise) at the end in this format:\n\"Final classification: [Inconsistent / Consistent]\"\nIf the provided text does not summarize the article, state clearly: \"Final classification: Invalid\".\nDo not include any additional text after the final classification.\n", "evaluation_response": "Reviewing the summary against the source article, nearly every key detail is directly supported. The summary correctly notes that Gill died (after having been diagnosed with the \"full English\" of cancers and undergoing chemotherapy), includes accurately described tributes from Martin Ivens (referring to him as the \"giant among journalists\" and \"heart and soul\" of the paper), and captures his final column being published. It also correctly covers the controversies (remarks about the Welsh, the Isle of Man, Norfolk, the review of Clare Balding, the baboon incident, and the restaurant incident), his background (dyslexia, his school details, and early career), and his family (marriages, the two children with Amber Rudd, and the two twins with Nicola Formby).\n\nOne minor point is that the summary states he “divorced both” of his spouses, while the source explicitly states that his marriage to Amber Rudd ended in divorce and only mentions his first marriage without an explicit note about its ending. However, it is a reasonable inference that his first marriage ended before his second marriage occurred, so this extra phrasing is a minor extrapolation rather than a clear contradiction.\n\nBecause all claims in the summary are broadly supported by the source article and any minor extrapolation is reasonable given the context, the final determination is that the summary contains no significant hallucinations.\n\nFinal classification: Consistent", "classification": "Consistent"}

Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers. The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International. All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups. The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin. Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions. \" I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,\" he urged readers on Facebook. Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. \" DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,\" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests. To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney. The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware. On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire. But officials deny this. \" We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,\" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC. On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych. The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the \"genocide\" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is \"We won't forgive or forget\", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media. During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: \"Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.\" Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine. Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists \"war criminals\" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict. They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website. In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified. Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as \"Humpty Dumpty\". What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders. The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine. In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces. And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine. Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women or five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n4.  **Prevalence:** In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers.\n5.  **County Variations:** The study tracked county-level data, finding the lowest binge drinking rate (6%) in Madison County, ID, and the highest (36%) in Menominee, WI. Hancock County, TN, had the fewest heavy drinkers (2%), while Esmeralda County, NV, had the most (22%).\n6.  **Contributing Factors:** Experts attribute increases to changing social norms (making heavy drinking more acceptable for women), the influx of affluent professionals in areas like the Bay Area, alcohol becoming cheaper in real terms due to taxes not keeping pace with inflation, increased alcohol advertising, and the weakening of alcohol control policies.\n7.  **Consequences & Response:** Alcohol caused about 88,600 US deaths in 2010 and costs over $220 billion annually.

Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women or five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.\n4.  **Prevalence:** In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers.\n5.  **County Variations:** The study tracked county-level data, finding the lowest binge drinking rate (6%) in Madison County, ID, and the highest (36%) in Menominee, WI. Hancock County, TN, had the fewest heavy drinkers (2%), while Esmeralda County, NV, had the most (22%).\n6.  **Contributing Factors:** Experts attribute increases to changing social norms (making heavy drinking more acceptable for women), the influx of affluent professionals in areas like the Bay Area, alcohol becoming cheaper in real terms due to taxes not keeping pace with inflation, increased alcohol advertising, and the weakening of alcohol control policies.\n7.  **Consequences & Response:** Alcohol caused about 88,600 US deaths in 2010 and costs over $220 billion annually. Treatment providers note increased demand but also that many won't seek help without severe consequences.\n8.  **Study Source:** Conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, analyzing CDC survey data from 3.7 million Americans aged 21+.\"\n\n------\n\nProvide reasoning first, then clearly state a final classification (Inconsistent if hallucinations of any kind are present, Consistent otherwise) at the end in this format:\n\"Final classification: [Inconsistent / Consistent]\"\nIf the provided text does not summarize the article, state clearly: \"Final classification: Invalid\".\nDo not include any additional text after the final classification.\n", "evaluation_response": "The summary accurately reflects the article’s details: it correctly reports the 17.2% increase in heavy drinking, the gender disparity including the \"7 times\" factor and county-specific figures (36% vs. 23% and the county stats), uses the proper definitions for heavy and binge drinking (including the \"in the past month\" qualifier), and includes the study’s prevalence data, contributing factors, consequences, and source information.

Turkey insists that the jet, from the Russian air contingent deployed in Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad, ignored warnings to leave its airspace. Russia says it was shot down within Syrian airspace and President Vladimir Putin vented his anger at Turkey's government again on Thursday, accusing it of subservience to the US and of \"creeping Islamisation\".

The Su-24 jet's black box was opened in Moscow, with the Russian investigator noting flight information appeared missing.\n2.  Data from the box could help resolve the dispute over the jet's location when it was hit, with an analysis expected next week.\n3.  The jet's downing caused a crisis in Russia-Turkey relations, leading to Russian sanctions.\n4.  Turkey claims the jet ignored warnings in Turkish airspace, while Russia insists it was shot down in Syrian airspace. Putin accused Turkey of US subservience and \"creeping Islamisation\".\n5.  Both countries are heavily involved in Syria with opposing positions, despite both being ostensibly opposed to IS.\n6.  The Su-24 was shot down by Turkish F-16s on 24 November. The pilot was killed by militants after ejecting, the navigator was rescued. A Russian marine was killed and a helicopter destroyed during the rescue attempt.\n7.  Russia demands an apology and has imposed sanctions, including a ban on package holidays potentially costing Turkey billions.\"\n\n------\n\nProvide reasoning first, then clearly state a final classification (Inconsistent if hallucinations of any kind are present, Consistent otherwise) at the end in this format:\n\"Final classification: [Inconsistent / Consistent]\"\nIf the provided text does not summarize the article, state clearly: \"Final classification: Invalid\".\nDo not include any additional text after the final classification.\n", "evaluation_response": "The summary is mostly faithful to the source, but it adds details that aren’t explicitly supported.

The history is faithfully captured by mentioning the previous explosion in July 2013 (with no casualties or toxic leaks) and that the plant was originally slated for Xiamen but was relocated in 2007 following public opposition related to pollution concerns.

The victim said she shouted and swore at Ayrton to stop the attack, but her friends had not woken up. She had \"only drunk a can and a half of Foster's\" and clearly recollected the events.

But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup. \"Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,\" she said. \"We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions. \"It would be more heartbreak than humiliation. \"Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group. \"Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,\" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. \" It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years. \"I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead. \"With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off. \"Iceland are top seeds in the group,\" Evans noted. \" They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them. \"But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them. \"It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference. \"Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall. \"It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,\" she recalled. \" There were thousands of people cheering when we came out. \"We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated. \"I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us. \"Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals. \"Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,\" she added. \"The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week. \"Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition.

The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region. Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana. Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area. Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage. In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena. In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said. Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage. Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor \"came out of nowhere\", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - \"medium-strong\" and \"fairly shallow\". Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement. The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided \"inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory\" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake. At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely. On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.\"\n\n------\n\nAnnotated Examples:\n\n\tSummary (1): \"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake occurred in Garfagnana, Italy, 35km north of Lucca, at a depth of 15.5km.
