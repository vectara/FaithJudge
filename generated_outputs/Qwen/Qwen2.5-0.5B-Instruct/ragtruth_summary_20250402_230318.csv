11395,"The passage describes the current situation regarding mountaineering activities in the Himalayan region, particularly focusing on the challenges posed by the Khumbu Icefall route. Here’s a concise summary:

- **Current Situation**: Mountaineers have resumed climbing the world's highest peak, Mount Everest, despite a tragic accident in 2014 that resulted in 16 fatalities. The route through Khumbu Icefall has been altered to a more challenging route due to increased risks.

- **Changes**: Climbers will now take a central route through the Khumbu Icefall, avoiding the area where the fatal accident occurred. This change aims to make the journey safer.

- **Safety Concerns**: There are ongoing debates about the risks involved in the Khumbu Icefall route, including exposure to the tumbling ice, hanging seracs, and potential avalanches.

- **Impact**: The changes aim to reduce risks and ensure a safer expedition. However, some climbers express concerns about the added difficulty and potential danger associated with the new route.

- **Local Context**: The route selection involves the local Nepalese committee, which voted to return to the central route for safety reasons. This decision reflects the growing awareness among climbers of the risks involved in the Khumbu Icefall route.

- **Alternative Routes**: Other routes have been proposed, such as the northern route from China, which is currently being considered by the Chinese side of Everest. This alternative route offers better conditions and potentially fewer risks compared to the central route.

- **Mountain Viewership**: The increasing popularity of the northern route has led to concerns among Nepali companies about diverting climbers to the Chinese side. This has raised questions about the long-term viability of the mountain viewings.

- **Personal Stories**: Several mountaineers are returning this year, sharing personal stories and reflections on their experiences. These narratives highlight the emotional impact of the tragedy and the importance of preserving the legacy of those lost in the past."

Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: ""At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs.""

""Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital."" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that ""the website"" was accurate.

11922,"Aqaba, Iraq (CNN) - Falih Essawi, deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, told CNN that ISIS militants might be just hours away from taking the key Iraqi city of Ramadi. The fighting has engulfed Ramadi, which lies only about 70 miles (113 kilometers) west of Baghdad and is the capital of Anbar province, Iraq's Sunni heartland. Essawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, told CNN from inside the city Wednesday that it's unclear how much longer government troops can hold their front lines against the ISIS offensive. The politician said he was on a front line himself, armed with a machine gun. Security was ""collapsing rapidly in the city,"" and he begged the Iraqi government for reinforcements and the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS for air support. He stressed that urgent support from the military and security forces is needed to save the city. ""This is what we warned Baghdad of what's going to happen,"" Essawi told CNN by phone, referring to the Iraqi government at the capital. ""Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi?"" His plea for help comes the day after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington to seek more support for the fight against ISIS. ""Just Allah knows if we will survive this,"" Essawi said. According to the Anbar official, at least 10 Iraqi security forces were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in the fighting against ISIS on Wednesday. The extremist group's offensive in Ramadi shows its resilience despite months of U.S.-led airstrikes and its recent defeat by Iraqi forces in the northern city of Tikrit. ISIS fighters have Ramadi under pressure from several angles. Essawi said ISIS militants made significant advances Wednesday in three areas east of Ramadi: Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem and parts of Soufia, which leads to central Ramadi. Later, he said that militants were rolling into the center of Ramadi. Over the weekend, the militants seized control of areas north of Ramadi. Routes south of the city were taken some months ago. That leaves only areas to the west of Ramadi in the hands of government forces, but those positions are under threat, Essawi warned. The recent fighting has driven a steady stream of refugees out of the city. On Wednesday, some residents packed what they could into metal carts as they prepared to flee on foot. People also were fleeing the areas where ISIS was advancing east of Ramadi. At least 150, 000 people have already fled since Wednesday morning, causing huge traffic jams on the roads leading outside the city, according to Essawi. A CNN team met with three families that had fled an ISIS assault in the Albu Ghanem area. Those families said Iraqi security and military forces withdrew from Albu Ghanem after a battle with ISIS, which took over the area quickly. One fleeing Albu Ghanem resident, Abu Ahmed, paused to talk to CNN as he and his family walked east toward Baghdad, crossing a bridge over the Euphrates River. He said four ISIS militants had entered his house and set up a sniper position on his roof. Abu Ahmed said he, his wife and four children walked away from the home with his elderly mother while the ISIS fighters were busy setting things up there. He said his family left everything behind. His family was using a cart to carry his mother, who couldn't walk. While talking about the fighters' takeover of his home, his wife started crying and asked God to help the rest of the families who are stuck in Albu Ghanem."
