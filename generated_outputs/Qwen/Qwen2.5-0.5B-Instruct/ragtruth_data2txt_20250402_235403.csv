   - **Text:** ""What a great brunch. A couple days ago my wife randomly decided she'd book a hotel in Santa Barbara for the weekend. She said she had already found a good spot for brunch Sunday morning. Usually I plan all the trips so she had a lot of pressure not to disappoint. And... she did not. Moral of the story: here we are now, just enjoyed a delicious breakfast burrito (her) and steak/eggs/frites (me). Most importantly the'mimosa madness' was served just the way I like it, just a splash of juice. This may have influenced this review:""

There were two orders a head of mine yet it took approximately 30 minutes to prepare two burgers, fries and a corn dog. The food was good, but not above average. All that being said, I would've returned if the service had been better. Not only did the food take forever, but I practically had to beg the cashier for extra ketchup which was ridiculous considering there was only one small pre-poured container in the bag. So was the person eating the corn dog supposed to dip their corn dog in the small container and the rest us just pass it around sparingly? The cashier just passive aggressively stared at me and blinked multiple times when I asked for extra ketchup. Given that it's a small spot I even tipped on my order takeout order to help support small businesses. I wanted so badly for this to be my go spot, but given the excessive wait times, value for price and not so great service, it will instead be a one and done.""

1. **Review 1:** ""Nice little place in downtown Santa Barbara where we stopped for late lunch/early dinner on our way back home to San Diego. We loved our flatbreads. I had been craving clam chowder and ordered it here. It was a little thick for my liking, but tasted good. Nice, friendly upscale casual place on State Street.""

2. **Review 2:** ""I had high hopes for this place, but it fell flat big time. I ordered the BLAT with grilled chicken and a side salad. I specifically asked for no tomato and they put tomato on both the sandwich and the salad. Not a huge deal, just annoying to pick it all off. And if you have an allergy, I would not trust this place to be mindful of that. The grilled chicken was not seasoned at all and the food overall was just extremely bland. My sandwich was stacked so high that the avocado all fell out as I was eating it. The side salad is lettuce, cucumber, red onion, and tomato. My bf got a burger with onion rings and he did not enjoy either part of the meal. The onion rings are beer battered and basically all batter. The burger was also unseasoned and not enjoyable. The service is ok. The staff is nice enough but my bf did have to get up and ask for his soda to be refilled and we were never offered a refill on our waters. We both left the restaurant with a stomach ache, I personally felt ill. I had stomach pains for a few hours afterwards and I can only assume it's because the food is not fresh because my meal didn't have any allergens that would've given me that reaction. Lastly, the cleaning spray they used on the tables just smelled funky. Idk how to explain it but we actually moved to an outside table because the inside one smelled so musty and mildewy.""

1. **Positive Review:**
   - ""I have to give this restaurant a 1-star rating purely due to horrible service. While the extremely pricey menu options were surprisingly good, the service in the whole restaurant was awful! Our server came to our table twice the entire night. Once to seat us, and once after we waited a very long time to get our check. He never came to check on us or ask how our food was even once! One table next to us even walked out before getting their food, or maybe they just never received it. A couple sat at the hostess stand for a good 10 mins before anyone greeted them as well. I'm surprised they didn't leave! It's too bad that the staff was so un attentive, because the food was actually pretty good! We will probably not be returning here:/""

   - ""I frequent this location often on the weekends as a hang-out location with my friends. Over the many time I have been here, I have had a consistent experience with the food, the environment, as well as the service. When you open the menu, you will be quite surprised at the wide variety of choices available. Dishes range from crab-cakes to artichoke dips to filet mignons. Personally, I have tried the steaks many times at Holdrens, as well as a few of their select appetizers. The food is good for the price, typically around $20-$30 per individual (Combination of entree and appetizer). To me, having frequented many steakhouses in the United States such as Mastro's and Strip House, I would have to say that the quality and presentation of the slab of meat is on par with my expectations. It might be a little bit on the high side in terms of the food, but what can you expect, it is Santa Barbara. I expect the price to be more catered to the location when looking at the prices. Overall, I was happy with my food because it was delicious and I left the restaurant a happy customer.""

1. **Review 1:** ""One of our favorite places to grab breakfast! They have a wide selection of donuts and their bagels are always tasty. I especially enjoy their homemade cream cheese flavors - I haven't had anything like them! Their vegetable cream had chopped up veggies in it and their strawberry cream cheese had jam. Definitely stop by to try some delicious bagel and cream cheese combo and donuts!""

2. **Review 2:** ""So happy to have stumbled upon this bagel place. I've had hundreds of NY bagels of the years but I'm telling you something about the bagels is special. I ordered the everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese and lox. Literal perfection. Had to stop again before we left.""

3. **Review 3:** ""Was in SB for the phish show 10/26. Trey and the boys laid it down, but the reason I was able to rokk was Spudnuts and Bagels. Had 3 of my 5 meals there while in town. The bagels are crispy but somehow airy not chewy! The ham and cheese filled croissant - get 2 or 3. The lady who was helping me was super nice and took the time to answer all my questions. When she found out i was flying her goods home to the fam she gave me some xtras she wanted them to try - thank you S&B!!""

1. **Positive Review:**
   - ""A friend and I ate lunch at Mala Town today. We arrived at noon and were the only ones there. The large and lush patio was great since the weather was nice, and my bowl of spicy soup noodles hit the spot. I used to live in Hong Kong and have traveled in Asia quite a bit. While I can't quite call what I ate 'traditional' in some respects, it was delicious.""

2. **Neutral Review:**
   - ""The food here is ok but not great, and kind of expensive for what it is. We tried both the mala tang and the dry pot (peanut-based sauce). The base is free, and you pay for the items you chose to add in (minimum of 4). They assemble your hot pot or dry hot pot in the kitchen before bringing it out in a regular bowl. The mala soup base was not very numbing, and the flavors of the base didn't seem very incorporated into the mix-ins.""

3. **Negative Review:**
   - ""I believe the restaurant will not last long, even their food is not bad, because the price is much higher than expected."""

""I had been wanting to try Neighbor Tim's BBQ since I heard about it several months ago. Tonight was finally the night we were going to order it! I ordered through GrubHub - I got the 2 meats/1 side deal with 2 orders of brisket, Mac and cheese, and added a side of the potato salad with bacon, and the beans with bacon. That also comes with white bread, pickles, and their 'famous BBQ sauce'. Overall, it was a little pricey but if it's good I am willing to pay it.""

#### Review 2:
""Loved our family feast! Thank you for bringing the joy of smoked meats and carefully crafted sides to our Saturday night. Awesome brisket and mac and cheese. Glad we decided to make the last minute addition of corn and black bean salad. Amazing customer service. Thank you Tim's crew! We'll be ordering again.""

#### Review 3:
""Thank you Neighbor Tim's for the great food and friendly service. I loved the brisket and mac and cheese. The potato salad was a big letdown. The sides were okay. I'd be willing to give it another try in the future WITH their BBQ sauce though, so don't totally count me out!""

I understand this is Americanized sushi but the scallops were overcooked and it was covered in a heavy layer of spicy mayo. For $15, it's really not worth it. Spend your money elsewhere.""

3. **Review 3:** I really like the Minnow...I mean you can't beat the location for a fast food establishment and the Fish Tacos are pretty good...BUT I'm always horrified to discover how much this fast food experience costs.  I mean, it's really not very good food unless you view it as cheap (but it's not).  Great thing, sitting outside by the harbor watching the BPs go by while you eat cheap (seeming) food.  Bad part, greasy spoon food served on paper plates by snarky staff with condiments that blow away...but it ain't cheap.  Guess that's Santa Barbara.""

3. **Review 3:** I will never go back to this location again. The workers in general have a negative attitude and think the customers owe them a medal for showing up to work.

I called them and the employee told me they could remake it. I threw the sandwich away and about 15 mins later got a call and was told that I had to bring the sandwich back. I told them I already tossed it in the garbage then the employee put his manager on the line and she was so RUDE and said that I need to bring it back ( I wasn't about to dig through the trash) and I said that the employee never said anything about bringing the sandwich back in the first conversation and he should have said something and expect me to still have it. And she said very unprofessionally, \""well he didn't know.\"" I told her that is a failure on the training and not the customer. She then said that next time I need to specifically write the word \""everything\"" on the side instead of using commas as I did. This manager is absolutely disgusting and clearly has no basic customer service skills. \n\nThis isn't the first time my pick up order has been destroyed. But the way that \""manager\"" spoke to me and handledis why I will NEVER go there again and will tell all my coworkers to stay away. \n\nTo the owner of this location: good Managers are hard to come by but you can absolutely do better then who was working on 10/13/21 @ 12:30 pm. She is horrible at her job and will continue to drive away customers with her terrible attitude.""

We both had fish & chips.  The fish was so bad that I asked the waiter what kind it was.  He said \"" it's red snapper, does it taste funky?\""  I'd like the restaurant to prove that wasn't the lowest quality tilapia on the market.  It tasted like metal and mud.

This is a huge loss to this entire community, as this was a truly comfortable place for regular folks, families and students to go and eat...and it was almost always packed to the rafters.\n\nThe word is that the landlord jacked the rent up to over 20k per month, triple net, and that was unsustainable for the owner, so he sold up and left.\n\nHow many fussy, trendy, hispter places must there be? I guess these are the only type of businesses welcome in southern Santa Barbara County.\n\nSo glad I left there when I did!\n\nRIP Denny's Goleta :-(""

What is their fault is my cream cheese rangoons with no fucking cream cheese in them.

1. **Review 1:** ""I don't know what took me so long to find this place but I love it. First off, they don't just make pizzas to go, they make amazing sandwiches! The Italian sub is by far my favorite. The rolls taste fresh and the meats are perfect! The combination of everything in the sandwich is just amazing! I'm not even a fan of sandwiches but this is my first choice of food there!""

2. **Review 2:** ""Always can depend on Valentino's for delicious food! Have been coming here since I was a kid and the food has consistently been tasty over all these years! Great sandwiches, pizzas and salads!""

3. **Review 3:** ""Hands down Shayre is an angel! This was our second time ordering a bulk order from this establishment and she got it done! We ordered 120 half sandwiches (100 turkey and 20 veggie) for new student orientation. She informed me that early bread deliveries recently have been tight bc of the pandemic, but the sandwiches were prepared and ready to go when I arrived! Shayre is such a sweet, hardworking individual and I highly recommend Valentino's for any event!"""

4. **Review 4:** I called and spoke with a supervisor (Jonathan) and told him the story and told him that the pizza was on my front porch, as I refused to eat it and refused to order a replacement (I just didn't trust them not to mess with my food.) The driver came back and grabbed the pizza and I am supposed to be getting a refund. We'll see if that really happens.

We call their chicken soup \""sick soup\"" and request it every time we have a cold or flu. It used to be delicious. (Even though they've always used frozen veggies and the chicken is terribly dry). This place has gone so far downhill in the past years. There is no flavor. It's about as Americanized as it can be, maybe dumbed down for SB's growing intolerance for spice. This is as close to Mexican food as the $2 tacos from Jack in the box.""

1. **Review 1:**  
   - Hosts Roberta and Mestre Daniel Yoshimi (aka Prof. Chin) provided an excellent menu of the favorite foods of Brazil (o Brasil, em português). One who appreciates tasty-good food simply cannot stay away very long. My tri tip was delicious, and the multiple traditional sides were exactly on-point.
   
   - Reviewer: My boyfriend and I went here for dinner and it was a nice experience :)
   
   - Reviewer: The restaurant facility itself may not look all that elegant and appealing but the service and the food really blows that away. They serve food for each meal of the day but I personally would recommend going for breakfast and trying one of their acai fruit bowls. Slightly on the pricier side but so worth it and you will be healthily full for hours to come! The culture here is also something that is unique and interesting. Great place for family brunch!

   - **Text:** It's hard enough to go out to dinner as a parent. Unfortunately for us, Laura (the hostess) was there to make it even more difficult. From the minute we started speaking to her she was unpleasant and dismissive. Our server (did not get her name) was very pleasant and offered to move us to the patio where it would be warmer. Our 2 year old started to fuss a bit, and Laura took it upon herself to let us know we would need to move our stroller if she needed to sit someone next to us (there were several tables available... starting to see why). Less than a minute later, she sat the very next couple right next to us, as I was trying to wrangle my 2 year old. (Once again, plenty of tables). It was clear she did so to make us uncomfortable, and it worked. We decided to take our business elsewhere. It is really unfortunate since I've had so many pleasant experiences here, which I why I wanted to take my family. I can confidently say we will not be back.

1. **Review 1:** Ordered food to go, it was cold. Everything was cold. I only had a 30-minute lunch break, so I didn't go back to return it. I didn't enjoy it at all one bit. Pretty upset. Paid $20 something for food and drink. The drink tasted pretty flat, no flavor. Plz go somewhere else for Mexican. Los Arroyos or Los Agaves is better and tastier. I rather do NO STARS on this place, but looks like I have too. Sucks I payed soo much and for nothing. I am not returning, however I will let my friends and family know my situation there.
   
2. **Review 2:** What can be said about this spot? Well, nice, cozy, comfortable, and hip environment with authentic Mexican decor to enjoy delicious Mexican dishes offered here! Salsa is spicy tomato sauce based, beans between whole and smashed, soups full of vegetables which comes in handy during flu season! And....they also serve hot Mexican chocolate served in hearty mugs! Recommended!

3. **Review 3:** Outdoor seating is an option! This place can be peaceful at certain times of the day, like a Sunday...early evening. The decor inside is super artsy and does help one to leave the daily grind in a different way. The environment really is different inside, in a cool way. I hope to eat inside again, when it feels more comfortable. That Chile Relleno burrito is comfort food with some nice salsa.

   - **Text:** ""Pretty disappointing. I've been wanting to eat here for several years based on what I thought was a great reputation in town.  I don't get over to the Mesa much but when I saw a coupon in a mailed flyer a couple months ago, I clipped it.  It offered a free entree with purchase of one entree and two drinks. Even with a discount of $12, the bill was $53 for lunch (before tip) -- I can eat a great dinner out for less than this -- so I was expecting a very delicious meal.  Both my companion and I felt the food was vastly overpriced for the quality, flavor and even presentation. The quantity was generous enough but the items we ordered (empanadas and the mushroom burger) were both rather bland.  The \""burger\"" was served on a doughy, barely cooked pita-like bread rather than on an appropriate item to hold a messy burger in place like a brioche bun.  It was completely falling apart after a few bites... which would have been okay to eat with a fork except it was just not flavorful or complex given the list of ingredients. The most interesting item was the ketchup made from beets.  Also the side fries weren't thoroughly cooked except for the smallest ones.  Definitely not a $24 item! The empanadas were somewhat better but again, not even a 'wow' and not even a 'hey, really tasty.' Just bland and again, not worth $24.  The half-off discount didn't even cover the $13 cost of a chai tea and lemonade (that was mostly ice of course).  All in all, very disappointing food and therefore completely overpriced.  We took the food to go so I cannot really comment on the service. When I read another lengthy review (12/5/21), I now see that the prices have been jacked and the quality has been wavering. I totally understand the precarious state of the restaurant business right now during covid but I cannot recommend this restaurant at this time.""

The flourless chocolate cake had a thick fudge consistency- which I like but flavor wise was ok. Price for the cakes were not worth it in my opinion ( would rather go to Anderson's or lilac for that price).

   - Review Text: ""We visited our UCSB son often and shop at the grocery store around the corner from this Subway. We stopped in for lunch one day and wanted to first wash up and use the restroom. It appeared that it was not occupied, but we asked before entering. We were told (with no respect to the culture but with a difficult to understand accent) that it was 'out of order.' We sensed differently since we saw someone exit the room after clearly using the facility. What? An employee can use the restroom and exit while picking away but lie to us about it being out of order? Too late to simply walk out since my son had already ordered and paid, but my wife and I obviously changed our minds about ordering after seeing this employee exiting the restroom while picking for whatever.""

There's indoor and outdoor seating and the cute Asian couple that owns it are so nice and sweet. \n\nI got the lunch combo with chicken teriyaki and California roll -- it comes with miso soup, rice, salad and 2 egg rolls. The miso soup was authentic and delicious, the teriyaki chicken was sweet/savory and grilled to perfection with bits of charred ends, the egg rolls were hot and crispy, the California roll was fresh and moist, and the salad was tossed with a tasty sesame ginger dressing. In terms of flavor, it's honestly on par with a lot of real Japanese restaurant bento lunches. \n\nIt was also a lot of food for under $15! I couldn't finish it all so I'll also have leftovers to eat for dinner tonight. I have yet to try the other menu items but I'll be sure to come back again soon!""

The 101 Deli offers a variety of options including sandwiches, sushi, and a tri-tip sandwich. While the food quality seems average, the ambiance and atmosphere seem appealing. However, some reviewers found the food unremarkable compared to more upscale restaurants. Overall, the review indicates a positive experience despite the lackluster food quality."

2. **Review 2**: ""This place is really convenient if you're staying at the hotel in the same parking area. I ordered the ribeye and I gotta say the flavor is underwhelming. I guess I expected too much in that it would be steakhouse quality but it's not. It's more like average coffee shop quality so I'm not impressed. The flavor also was lacking as it's not seasoned all that well.""

3. **Review 3**: ""I'm not sure how this place is getting good reviews. I'm staying at the hotel because my daughter is hospitalized at cottage. Having to spend Thanksgiving in the hospital really bites but we were with family. My husband didn't want to eat the hospital food so suggested the restaurant. They had a special menu as it was Thanksgiving. I ordered it to go to eat dinner with our daughter. When I got it back to the hospital room I couldn't be more disappointed. $20 plate of barely any food. I let my husband eat mine and I had what the hospital served which was half the price double the food and better quality. I mean there were literally 4 green beans and 3 carrot slices in each container. We will not be eating here ever again. What a rip off.""

They paid approximately $20 for fresh chicken, but the woman on the counter was rude and the food was left untouched inside the box. The reviewer did not recommend this branch due to poor customer service.
   
2. **Review 2:** The reviewer experienced a similar issue with burnt and cold chicken. The pizza was also touched inside the box by the delivery person, leading to disgust.

They also left the tails on the shrimp. We ordered delivery through Restaurant Connection which was the only delivery option, and it took 1.5 hours and a dish was forgotten (not sure whether the fault or the restaurant or the delivery service) but we did get a refund after calling. Our friends did really enjoy the pork belly fried rice but the drunken noodles had a very high ratio of vegetables to noodles.""

The vibe here is amazing and can't wait to come back, the staff is very friendly but...I must say, the girl working the gift shop in the brown plaid was seriously the sweetest! So friendly and so helpful. If everyone had employees like her, their business would be much more successful. She was very personable and relatable and also had great selections to offer. She even gave me good advice on a hoodie and also a 'road-soda' to take with me! Her words were, 'the ethereal embrace is fun to say and such a great treat at the end of a shift.' She was absolutely right! What a treat to sip, on the way back to OC. This location needs to do what they can to keep her around because she is EXACTLY why people return to places like this. Not just because of the environment but because of the people who make the environment great! I unfortunately didn't catch her name but she is a keeper!

1. **Review 1:**  
   ""I've been in here twice during the past 2 weeks & its always borderline dead. The one bartender that actually talked to me I guess is only an emergency bartender who only gets to work when someone else cancels. Came in one night as a non-working employee was leaving. The bartender was in the back room for almost 10 minutes while I was waiting to order. The leaving employee was nice enough to serve me. The  Thursday bartender never greeted me afterwards, never asked if I wanted anything else, never said anything to me but played on his phone, watched an infomercial. I guess I'll be finding another bar for when I'm in town.""

2. **Review 2:**  
   ""The bar tender there Matt Topete makes drinking at old town tavern an experience in its self, he is quick on the draw with a drink and may not be able to tell one but can take a joke. He knows more than most about sports and will have a conversation with any patron and make them feel right at home""

3. **Review 3:**  
   ""Love the bar the people and the tenders. If you can find a liquor they don't have. They'll get it. Karaoke dj rocks the house best attentive dj ever again if he doesn't have a song he'll get it."""

My friend had the $40 steak dish (which I see is no longer on the menu) and the steak was juicy and delicious. Congrats! You made a yummy! However, they use Miracle Whip in their deviled eggs. Rewind....whuuuut?? Ew and moving on. I looked forward to trying their tiramisu and after the server hyped it up, he told us it was not ready for the eating and wouldn't be until the next day. Tiramisu tease! A place that charges $40 for a dish should NEVER have Miracle Whip on the premises!!! Where is your pride?! Ohhh yeah, it's at the bottom of that jar of Miracle Whip. It's miracle if they stay open, and it certainly won't be attributed to my returning patronage."""

   - **Text:** ""It perplexes me that this place is always so empty. Honestly it is the best food in IV without a doubt and it's because the owners double as the cooks and are invested in the overall quality of their ingredients and product. They are always entertaining and you could learn a thing or two from just conversing with them during your lunch. Consider helping out this humble mom and pop shop before heading to a big franchise restaurant because they do not compromise anything in their menu and are competitively priced compared to the rest of IV. \n\nI would recommend the Tuna sandwich for it's delicious combination of dressings and tastiness of the fish. Every bite is savory and leaves you wanting more. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches really though.""

Upset that after making the reservation so far in advance we were sat on the chilly patio. I protested to the hostess only to be told that the empty tables were'reserved.'

Appetizer: ceviche with tortilla chips- thick, super-crunchy chips, ceviche light and flavorful. My entree: panko-crusted swordfish with saffron basmati rice, red and green peppers, and thai coconut sauce- delicious, not heavy, lightly breaded and perfectly cooked. Hubby's entree: duck breast and sausage with lentils which was rich and very flavorful. Side: truffle fries with ketchup- yum! very generous portion.""

**Text:** ""Came here for breakfast since it was open decently early in the morning. The place is beautiful, but some issues with the bill and somewhat the food.
I had both the Crispy Yukon grilled potatoes, and the Lido's breakfast sandwich. The potatoes were delicious, and I found them to be more delicious than the sandwich. The potatoes also had a very generous serving.""

**Text:** ""New hours and the system as of Sept 5...now the restaurant is open for breakfast from 7am instead of 8.  Also, you can place your order with a server if you're dining in (instead of lining up at the bar counter).
The catch is...if you would like to dine outdoors, you'd have to wait till 8am when the pool opens.  Also, be aware it gets very busy between 9am and 10:30sh weekends as usual.
All servers are consistently good, friendly, and efficient!
Their lunch and dinner options are good as well.  I was going to have dinner @ Costa, but ended up eating (mussels) here after seeing someone else's meal. ;)""

**Text:** ""The food is OK. The granola was not bad. The date shake was so so as well. It really got to me was it took forever for the waiter to come to the table.
I'm top of that I can't stand companies that demand 20% gratuity regardless of service. I understand if it's a table of six or more etc. or even demanding 15 or 18 percent. But as someone who typically tips over 25% when I am demanded it really bothers me. If this has to do with fair wages then raise the prices of the items. Then you leave it up to the market to decide. But there's nothing posted anywhere that says a mandatory 20% tip. That's my other problem. If you're going to require that we need to disclose it on the front door.""

   ""Really reasonable prices and great sandwiches, soups, and salads. We grabbed lunch here while working remotely nearby and looking for something healthy we could eat (everything else that turned up in my search with greater than 4 stars was Mexican - not a surprise!). I had a half turkey sandwich with soup, and the half was a generous size. While they have some trendy drink options, the rest of the place is kind of old school vs trendy (in a good way). Great lunch spot!""

3. **Review 3:**  
   ""The parking is a bit limited, unless you are here for a quick in and out, but there's parking half a block away. I have avoided coming here because I witnessed an unprovoked PitBull attack on the patio, where the PitBull literally took a huge chunk out of a man's leg. We were all confused, and I'm left traumatized by that experience, with a bloody leg imprinted on my mind every time I see this place. Be forewarned: this is a dog place. Big dog, mean dog, and itty bitty dogs come here with their owners. This spot is very popular around lunch time. The food is slow, so you'll have a lot of folks waiting around for carry out during lunchtime.""

This review highlights several positive aspects of the establishment:

- Reasonable prices and quality of sandwiches.
- A nice atmosphere with a cute little mart.
- A friendly service from the staff.
- A unique takeout option.

Both my friend and I had the blood orange margarita, which was so good because it had a jalapeño kick! But, don't worry it's not too spicy for anyone that is sensitive to spice, it was just right.""

2. **Friend's Friend's Review:**
   - ""Both my friend and I had the combination plate; me the taco and enchilada and her the taco and tamale. To be honest the only reason why I didn't go with the mahi mahi taco was because it was singular (taco) versus the other tacos were plural in the name (tacos). And I was expecting to get at least two tacos in the combo. However, only one came so I would ask that the menu be more clear. But, the food was delicious and we even had enough for leftovers. Both plates came with rice and beans too.""

3. **Review 3:** ""CLOSED tonight for a private party which is a wedding. I was a hotel guest at the Kimpton Goodland which per the employees is separate from the Outpost and Good Bar. I was a patron as well at the Outpost with a party of 13. Was told to be quite by people from the private party which was a wedding so that their speeches could be heard on the patio which is where they had their dining portion of the reception. Not only did we comply but we shushed others in the restaurant. The wedding guests/party were very appreciative and invited us to dance in the Good Bar where the reception concluded. We went and had a great time dancing until Tyrell the food/beverage manager kicked us out. We kept getting invited in and he kept kicking us out. We did not eat any food or order any drinks, just danced with the party/guests that invited us in. Tyrell kept kicking us out and when we complained to hi. He said \""I don't care who invited you in I'm going to keep kicking you out.\"" We told other guests of the wedding we couldn't go in and they said tell the manager to ask the bride/groom who would be fine with us there. We asked Tyrell to do that and he said \""No and even if they did say it was ok I still wouldn't let you in.\"" He was very unprofessional and rude. We complained to the hotel front desk and although they offered apologies they also said since they were separate from the restaurant/bar there was nothing they could do. I will NEVER stay at any Kimpton/IHG hotel and once I find out who owns The Outpost and The Good Bar I will never visit their establishments either. Kimpton needs to get this employee under control and teach him about customer service."""

Pizza is one of those foods that should almost always give you joy, whether it's a $3 frozen pizza from the grocery store or a late night slice at a hole in the wall. But this pizza (and it was the'soppressata' supposedly one of the most popular) gave us no joy.""

3. **Review 3:**  
   ""Never had Roman style pizza before and i am thoroughly impressed!!! The crust was incredible, and the ratio of toppings to bread was perfect. The toppings also matched so so well Different pizzas we tried : - Bbq chicken : Wow. I'm a huge fan of bbq anything, but with this specific type of dough it was even more amazing. There were some parts that were too heavy with the bbq, but overall i was blown away - Mushroom : Really yummy! The umami flavor from the mushroom really came through - Potato : Never had potato pizza before, and i will continue to get it from now on. It was so delicious, and the addition of goat cheese was heavenly. The potatoes were cooked to perfection and just chefs kiss""

   - **Text:** ""Had a craving for salmon, and was thrilled to find this place. Came in and ordered 2 orders of salmon sushi. The waiter gave me one of those faces where you're pretty sure he didn't understand, but it'd be kind of awkward to ask if he didn't understand. So he returned a while later with spicy salmon rolls. When I explained that wasn't really what I had ordered, he returned to the kitchen, then came back a minute later to explain they'd used up all the salmon on the spicy rolls.""

   - **Text:** ""OK - let me preface this review by saying this: the term \""all-you-can-eat\"" and sushi should NEVER EVER be in the same sentence. The point of sushi is that it's fresh, prepared to order and any place that has \""all-you-can-eat\"" amounts of it, is certainly not giving you anything quality. Now I can't comment on this sushi in particular because I didn't have any (nor would I ever, anywhere) - but the Thai we had here was fine. I had the Japanese curry which was way too soupy (not like mom's) and tasted the coconut. Bot were so-so. We were headed over to the Arlington Theatre to see David Byrne so were in sort of a rush but this place didn't do much to impress. From the slow service to the waitstaff basically tripping over themselves, it was just an average experience at-best. Cheap but not so good.""

1. **Montecito Location:** The restaurant on Montecito Street has closed down, which is disappointing. However, the Montecito location is still open and serves excellent food. The menu offers lots of vegetarian options and fresh, organic salads. The daily vegetable risotto is also exceptional. The restaurant has been a favorite for many years, but I am now going to the State Street location.
   
2. **Montecito Location:** This is a cozy, intimate place with a sweet outdoor patio. The coffee is very good, especially their Peet's brand. Enjoying the view while enjoying your meal!

3. **Cheese and Wine:** A fun place for cheese and wine lovers. They offer Wine samples and a fan static cheese plate appetizer that includes blue cheese, Brie, and boscottis. Sitting outside allows you to watch people walk by, making it an entertaining experience.

1. **Review 1:** Five stars? People must be out of their minds (not surprising near UCSB). I heard great things about the ""old Rincon"", but whatever they have done recently has definitely dropped the food quality. This is the most average Mexican food I've had in awhile - that stuff we ate in the '80s at Chi Chi's and Pepe's because we didn't know better and didn't have options. You have options!

2. **Review 2:** Best Mexican food there is by the UC!  Wait staff and hostess are the bomb and so fun and polite. Enjoy eating here every time I am in town.

3. **Review 3:** Had the steak Bohemio and it was fantastic and my wife had a michelada that reminded me of our favorite from Ensenada! Sat in the patio which was nice and really enjoyed the mariachi which comes though and plays throughout the restaurant. Will definitely be coming back, especially when the mariachi is here. Great touch...
