1. **Separation**: 
   - **Elements** cannot be separated into simpler substances.
   - **Compounds** can be separated into simpler substances through physical methods like distillation or crystallization.
   - **Mixture** can be separated into simpler substances but does not necessarily result in a new compound.

2. **Composition**:
   - **Elements** consist of only one type of atom.
   - **Compounds** consist of multiple types of atoms bonded together.
   - **Mixture** consists of both elements and compounds, but it does not necessarily show the properties of its constituents.

3. **Properties**:
   - **Elements** do not change when mixed with others.
   - **Compounds** may change when mixed with others, depending on the reaction conditions.
   - **Mixture** retains some of the original properties of its constituents.

In summary, elements are pure substances consisting of only one type of atom, compounds are made up of multiple types of atoms bonded together, and mixtures are a physical combination of elements or compounds where the parts are not chemically bonded and retain their own identities."

12409,"To fry chicken in the oven, follow these steps:

1. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. In a pie pan or a wide, shallow bowl, mix together flour, paprika, salt, and pepper.
3. Add the chicken pieces to the flour mixture, shaking them gently to coat evenly.
4. If using a pie pan, put the chicken pieces in the center of the pan. If using a bowl, spread the chicken pieces out in a single layer.
5. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes.
6. Turn the chicken pieces over and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until they are cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
7. While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rest of the ingredients by combining flour and seasoning in a paper bag or plastic container.
8. In a separate pan, melt the butter and add the remaining margarine.
9. Arrange the chicken pieces in the prepared pan, placing the buttered side up.
10. Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then flip the chicken over and cook for an additional 15 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).

Note that this method may vary slightly depending on the specific recipe you're following, so always check the instructions carefully before attempting to fry your own chicken."

This process involves the heart pumping blood throughout the body, where it is subsequently transported to various organs and tissues for energy production and other bodily functions."
