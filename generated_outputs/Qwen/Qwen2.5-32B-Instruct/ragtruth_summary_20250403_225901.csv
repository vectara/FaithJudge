15601,"An outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors found significant failures in reporting, editing, and fact-checking at Rolling Stone leading to a flawed article about a supposed gang rape at the University of Virginia. The magazine apologized for the story's impact. The possibility of defamation lawsuits by affected parties, such as the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, hinges on whether the statements were false, defamatory, and caused harm. While universities cannot sue for defamation, individual fraternity members might if they can prove personal harm and fit into the ""small group"" exception. However, the fluid nature of fraternity membership complicates this argument. Successful defamation claims typically require proof of financial harm, making this a complex and unusual case."

15759,"The passage discusses the fatal shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager, emphasizing the impact of a bystander's video capturing the incident.
