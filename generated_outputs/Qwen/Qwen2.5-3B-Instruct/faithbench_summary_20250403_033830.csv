15-3,"The study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington reveals that heavy drinking among Americans, especially women, has significantly increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012.

Despite this increase, the overall percentage of people drinking any alcohol remains relatively stable. The study also notes that excessive drinking led to approximately 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010 and costs around $220 billion annually.
