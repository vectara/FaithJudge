For example, the skeletal and muscular systems work together to provide structure and movement. The digestive system processes food, while the respiratory system supplies oxygen and removes carbon dioxide. The urinary system cleans blood and removes waste products, which are then expelled from the body. Each system interacts with others, such as the urinary system cleaning waste from the skeletal, muscular, digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems, and the respiratory system providing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the muscular, digestive, skeletal, circulatory, urinary, and nervous systems."

15143,"Based on the provided passages, here are the key differences between elements, compounds, and mixtures:

- **Elements**: These are pure substances made up of only one type of atom. They cannot be broken down into simpler substances through chemical means.
  
- **Compounds**: These are substances composed of two or more different elements that are chemically bonded together. Unlike elements, compounds have distinct properties different from their constituent elements and can be broken down into simpler substances through chemical reactions.

- **Mixtures**: These consist of two or more substances (elements or compounds) that are physically combined but not chemically bonded. The components of a mixture can be separated using physical methods, and the mixture retains its original properties. The composition of a mixture can vary depending on how much of each component is present."
