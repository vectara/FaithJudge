12-0,"A juvenile female Omura's whale, previously thought to be extinct and rarely sighted, was found on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia following Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This is the first sighting in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. Initially difficult to identify, confirmation came via DNA profiling. The discovery is significant for scientists due to the limited knowledge about the species, which was scientifically described only in 2003. The whale, typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, has a sleek body and unique skeletal features. The carcass was buried, and its skeleton will be retrieved later for further study and potential museum display."
