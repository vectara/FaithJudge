13-3,"Scotland's women's national football team, currently undefeated in their qualifiers, faces Iceland in a crucial match at Falkirk Stadium. A win could secure their place in the Euro 2017 finals. The team, led by players like 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Leanne Evans, aims to avoid the heartbreak of previous play-off losses. With several players based in top leagues abroad, including Evans who recently won the women's Bundesliga, the team benefits from international experience and high-level competition. The match against Iceland, also unbeaten, and the subsequent fixture in Reykjavik will likely determine the group winner. Scotland is in a strong position to qualify directly, even as a runner-up, due to the tournament's qualification rules."
13-4,"A light general aviation Aerostar plane landed at Aero Acres Residential Airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida, without deploying its landing gear, resulting in a belly landing. The incident was captured on video, showing the plane skidding on the runway, its propellers hitting the ground, and the wings bouncing from the impact. Upon realizing the mistake, the pilot re-engaged the engines and took off again, despite the damage to the propellers. The video maker expressed concern about the potential for a crash due to the damage. The pilot, Chris Georgaklis, aged 85, with nearly 50 years of flying experience, managed to fly the damaged aircraft 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and landed safely. The most frequent causes of such gear-up landings are human error or mechanical failure, and the FAA is investigating this incident."

The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton for further study and potential museum display."
