The chocolate old fashioned was so dry I couldn't even get thru one bite.   I get that there is so much less traffic.   But then make less at a time and make them again in the afternoon.   The maple  buttermilk bar weighed a ton and again was so dry.  Usually the apple fritter can save the day... but no go, unfortunately.
