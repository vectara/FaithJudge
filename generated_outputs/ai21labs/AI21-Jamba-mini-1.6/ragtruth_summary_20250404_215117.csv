The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned consumers not to consume any products from this plant, which include 3-ounce servings marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S, or T behind the coding date.

15601," Rolling Stone magazine published a flawed article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia (UVA), prompting an external review by Columbia Journalism School professors that highlighted significant editorial failures. The article's portrayal of a fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, as involved in the alleged incident has led to potential legal repercussions. While UVA, as a public university, cannot sue for defamation due to its status as a governmental entity, Phi Kappa Psi may pursue legal action. The fraternity could argue that the defamatory statements were ""of or concerning"" them, as the article's implications were easily imputed to individual members, causing harm to their reputations. However, Rolling Stone's lawyers might counter that the fraternity is a large and fluid group, making it difficult to prove individualized injury. The fraternity would need to demonstrate tangible damages and overcome the high legal thresholds for defamation cases involving private individuals."

15628," Alaska Airlines Flight 448, en route to Los Angeles from Seattle, made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff due to unusual banging noises from the cargo hold. The source was identified as a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines, who had fallen asleep in the pressurized, temperature-controlled cargo hold.

15634," Emy Afalava, a decorated veteran born in American Samoa, a U.S. territory since 1900, has been denied the right to vote despite being subject to American law his entire life. The Constitution, specifically the Fourteenth Amendment, declares that all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens. However, the federal government insists that Afalava is not a citizen. The D.C. Circuit is currently hearing a federal lawsuit on the matter. The history of U.S. territorial citizenship is marked by racial discrimination, as seen in the Dred Scott case, which legitimized slavery, and the Gonzalez case, which denied Puerto Ricans full citizenship rights. The upcoming decision could finally grant citizenship to American Samoans, ending the last instance of territorial disenfranchisement in the U.S."

15651," Pope Francis faced a diplomatic dilemma regarding the Armenian genocide, balancing the need to acknowledge historical atrocities with the desire to maintain diplomatic relations. In a high-profile Mass commemorating the centenary of the Armenian genocide, Pope Francis quoted his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, who had used the term ""genocide"" in a 2001 document but avoided saying it aloud. This approach allowed Pope Francis to acknowledge the genocide without directly using the term, which could have angered Turkey, a key ally in the fight against ISIS. The Turkish government recalled its ambassador in response to Pope Francis's comments, underscoring the sensitive nature of the issue. Despite the controversy, Pope Francis encouraged his priests to speak frankly and bear the courage of their convictions, emphasizing the importance of honesty and conviction in the face of difficult issues."

15661," Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed a second remote-controlled robot into the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant after the first one broke down. The second robot collected data from all 11 points as scheduled and detected lower radiation levels and temperature than expected, indicating that cooling systems were working effectively. The yellow discoloration of the grating in the images remains unexplained, and the green glow could not be seen from other angles. The shape-shifting robots were sent in to assess the damage in one of the reactors that suffered a meltdown after a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. TEPCO says the site's still too dangerous for workers to enter, and the decommissioning work is estimated to cost $50 billion and will take years to complete."

15670," A Polish prince, Jan Zylinski, challenged Nigel Farage, a British politician, to a duel in Hyde Park over Farage's immigration policy. Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), has criticized Britain's membership in the European Union, claiming it prevents the country from managing its borders and controlling immigration. Zylinski, holding a sword that belonged to his father, a World War II war hero, criticized Farage's blaming of immigrants for traffic jams and challenged him to a duel in the traditional style of an 18th-century Polish aristocrat and an English gentleman. Farage declined the offer but suggested that Zylinski might agree with him that it's a tragedy for Poland that so many of its brightest and best young people have left. Zylinski also posted a video titled ""7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,"" highlighting Polish contributions to Britain, including the efforts of Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain, their work ethic, and easy integration into the community."
15673," Seven people, including Illinois State University associate men's basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch, died in a plane crash while returning from the NCAA tournament final. The aircraft, a Cessna 414, went down about 2 miles east of the Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington, near the ISU campus. The plane was coming from the NCAA Final Four championship game in Indianapolis. ISU President Larry Dietz expressed grief over the tragedy, describing the loss as profound. Torrey Ward was a standout player at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and played professionally in China before becoming a coach.

15690," Sofia Vergara is embroiled in a legal dispute with her ex-fiance, Nick Loeb, over two frozen embryos they created during their relationship. Loeb filed a lawsuit to prevent Vergara from destroying the embryos and wants to implant them in a surrogate. The case raises questions about the rights to embryos and the beginning of life.

15695," The Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, which lasted over seven days and involved more than 130 witnesses and 400 pieces of evidence, resulted in a first-degree murder conviction for the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd. The jury, which included individuals unfamiliar with Hernandez's football career, was deeply affected by the evidence, particularly the multiple gunshots and Hernandez's apparent indifference to Lloyd's death. The jurors emphasized that Hernandez's celebrity status did not influence their decision, highlighting their commitment to a fair trial. The verdict has left Hernandez facing life in prison without parole, while Lloyd's family continues to mourn their loss."
15696," A SkyWest Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York, due to an undisclosed issue that caused passengers to experience symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, and difficulty breathing. A nurse on board attended to three passengers who lost consciousness, including one who was initially very lethargic and turning gray.

The case highlighted the complexities of Hernandez's life, from his promising football career to his troubled personal life, including bar fights, drug use, and a shooting incident. The NFL and the Patriots were praised for their handling of the situation, swiftly cutting ties with Hernandez and not attempting to defend his character. The article emphasizes that despite the headlines, the majority of NFL players are law-abiding citizens, and it's impossible to predict who might commit such crimes."
15702," Louis Jordan, an inexperienced sailor, survived 66 days adrift on the Atlantic Ocean after his 35-foot Pearson sailboat capsized and broke its mast in a storm. He faced numerous challenges, including a broken shoulder, lack of food and water, and multiple capsizings. Jordan managed to collect rainwater and catch fish using his laundry as bait.

He is expected to return to his marina next week."
15708," The French prosecutor leading the investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 stated that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that ""so far no videos were used in the crash investigation"" and urged anyone with such footage to immediately hand it over to the investigators. This follows claims by two magazines, German daily Bild and French Paris Match, of a cell phone video showing the final seconds on board the plane as it crashed into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board. The publications described the video but did not post it on their websites. They said it was found by a source close to the investigation and contained cries of ""My God"" in several languages, metallic banging, and screams that intensified before ending abruptly. However, an official with France's accident investigation agency, the BEA, said they were not aware of any such video, and a French Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the crash site called the reports ""completely wrong"" and ""unwarranted."""
15714," A nuclear submarine undergoing repairs at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire, with the blaze originating from the rubber insulation between the light and pressure hulls during welding work.

15740," In a French chalk quarry, nearly 100-year-old graffiti has been discovered, providing a glimpse into the lives of World War I soldiers. The inscriptions, written in a dark, maze-like underground city, include personal details such as names, units, and hometowns. The site, rediscovered in the late 19th century and used as a refuge during the war, was purchased in 2013 by a consortium aiming to promote its historical significance. The graffiti, numbering 1,821 names, offers a human connection to the soldiers, some of whom were killed shortly after leaving their mark."
15744," The Rolling Stone article on a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia (UVA) has been retracted, but it has brought attention to the university's handling of sexual assault cases. UVA has never expelled a student for sexual assault, even when the student admitted to it. The Virginia attorney general has asked the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers to investigate UVA's handling of sexual assault allegations, including the discredited Rolling Stone article. The alleged gang rape occurred in 2012, and the victim, Jackie, reported it to the university the following spring. She also spoke publicly about the incident, but police did not pursue the case due to a lack of cooperation from Jackie.

The Rolling Stone article highlighted a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims of sexual assault. Many women came forward to share their experiences, including the use of a euphemism for the word ""rape"" and the presence of fraternities with reputations for being ""rapey."" Some women felt that the internal process for reporting rape was not worth it if their abuser would not be expelled.

The retraction of the Rolling Stone article has raised concerns that survivors may be hesitant to come forward with their stories. The article had opened up a conversation about the issue, and its retraction may have set back progress in addressing sexual assault on campus. The Columbia Journalism School's critique of the article highlighted the need for more thorough fact-checking and the potential for sensationalism to overshadow important issues."
15747," Jia Jiang, a Chinese-born, American-based entrepreneur, launched a ""100 Days of Rejection"" project to confront his fear of rejection after quitting his six-figure job to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams. The project, which included asking for $100 from a stranger and requesting a Krispy Kreme manager to create Olympic-themed donuts, went viral and led to media appearances, speaking engagements, and job offers. Jiang's goal was to demystify rejection and turn it into an opportunity, sharing his experiences in his book, Rejection Proof. Key takeaways from his project include understanding that rejection is often more about the rejector than the rejectee, viewing rejection as a numbers game, and using rejection as a tool for growth and innovation."
15753," The Ebola outbreak, the most severe public health emergency in modern times, has affected over 25,000 people, resulting in more than 10,000 deaths. While the epidemic's intensity has decreased, new cases are still being reported weekly, with the latest World Health Organization (WHO) report confirming 30 new cases.

15759," The passage discusses the fatal shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager in North Charleston, highlighting the critical role of video evidence in ensuring justice.

The author argues that body cameras can help improve police-community relations and reduce fear, while also serving as a deterrent against misconduct. The piece calls for broader social changes to address racial disparities and suggests that body cameras are a necessary interim solution to promote accountability and transparency in policing."
15778," The Shariya refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan houses thousands of Yazidis who fled the ISIS assault in Sinjar. The camp, consisting of over 4,000 tents, is located about 18 miles from the front lines with ISIS, where airstrikes are occasionally heard. The majority of the camp's occupants are from Sinjar, which is near the border with Syrian Kurdistan.

The Yazidis faced severe persecution from ISIS, with thousands taken captive. Men were given the choice to convert to Islam or be shot, while women and girls as young as 8 years old were taken as slaves. Ahlam, a Yazidi woman, recounts how her family was taken prisoner, forced to work, and how she managed to call her husband to inform him they were alive but prisoners.

Ahlam and her family eventually escaped and made it to Iraqi Kurdistan, where they were reunited with Mahmoud, Ahlam's husband. However, Ahlam's parents are still with ISIS, and the family continues to fear for their safety. Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, is advocating for international support and airstrikes to help defeat ISIS and rescue the captives."
15779," An American woman, Debra Lobo, was shot and wounded in Karachi, Pakistan, on Thursday. The assailants, riding a motorcycle, shot her while she was driving from the Jinnah Medical and Dental College, where she works as vice principal, to pick up her daughters from school.

She has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Christian Pakistani. Karachi police are investigating the incident."
15786," A Delaware family fell ill during a vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands, likely due to pesticide exposure. The father, Steve Esmond, remains unable to move or talk, while his teenage sons are in critical condition in a Philadelphia hospital. The mother, Theresa Devine, has been released from the hospital and is undergoing occupational therapy. The EPA found evidence of methyl bromide in the villa, a pesticide restricted in the U.S. due to its toxicity. The family was exposed after a fumigation at the resort, and the Justice Department has initiated a criminal investigation. Terminix, the pest control company involved, is cooperating with authorities and conducting an internal investigation."
15789," The American Pharmacists Association (APA) has adopted a policy banning its members from participating in executions, citing that such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers. This decision, made at the APA's annual meeting, aligns with the association's previous positions to oppose the use of the term ""drug"" for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participating in lethal injection cases. The APA's action follows increased public attention on lethal injection, including a Supreme Court decision to stay the execution of three death row inmates in Oklahoma due to concerns about the method's effectiveness and humane application. The APA's stance aligns with other professional medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American Board of Anesthesiology."
15791," The passage discusses the connection between climate change and public health, emphasizing the potential health impacts of climate change and the importance of addressing these issues. It highlights how climate change can affect air quality, increase the prevalence of diseases like asthma, and lead to more health problems for vulnerable populations. The passage also mentions the role of medical professionals in raising awareness about the health impacts of climate change and the potential for technology to help monitor and address these issues. Additionally, it references studies and statistics that illustrate the potential health risks associated with climate change and the need for action to mitigate these effects."
15800," A cyclist, Wang Pingan, had his mountain bike stolen just days before completing a 460-day, 29,200-kilometer journey through China. The theft occurred in Shenzhen, where Wang had locked his bike to check out electronics markets. The police recovered the bike, which had been sold twice, and returned it to Wang. Despite offers for a new bike, Wang had vowed to walk if he couldn't be reunited with his ""old lover,"" as the bike held special meaning to him. The police spokesman said they didn't want Wang to have a bad memory of Shenzhen."
15817," The passage describes the complex and perilous journey of migrants from various African and Middle Eastern countries to Europe, with Libya serving as a primary departure point. Driven by factors such as political repression, economic hardship, and conflict, these migrants face significant risks, including exploitation, violence, and the dangers of the journey itself. The role of smugglers and the evolving strategies of European countries to manage the influx are also highlighted, underscoring the human cost and the challenges of addressing this ongoing crisis."
11317," Walmart has emerged as a key indicator of shifting public opinion on social issues, particularly regarding gay rights. The company's opposition to a religious freedom law in Arkansas, where it is based, reflects a broader trend of businesses supporting workplace policies that promote gay equality. Walmart's actions, including its stance on the Arkansas law and its previous moves to protect gender identity and offer health benefits to same-sex partners, highlight the company's evolution on social issues. This shift is partly due to Walmart's diverse consumer base and recognition of changing societal views on gay equality. The company's opposition to the Arkansas law also puts it at odds with many in the Republican Party, which it has traditionally supported."
11323," Easter is a significant Christian holiday celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, following his Crucifixion on Good Friday. It is observed on different dates each year, determined by the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. The holiday's date is further complicated by the use of different calendars—the Gregorian and Julian—leading to separate Easter celebrations for Western and Eastern Orthodox Christians. Easter's traditions, including the Easter Bunny and colored eggs, have evolved over time, with the bunny possibly originating from German immigrants in the 1700s and the eggs from medieval Europe. These symbols, along with the holiday's astronomical connections, add to the rich and complex nature of Easter."
11332," The Japanese government has confirmed that its Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) has never encountered extraterrestrial unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that while the ASDF scrambles fighter jets to investigate unidentified flying objects that could violate Japanese airspace, they have never found any objects believed to have come from outer space. The discussion was prompted by a question from former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, who claims to have seen a UFO and believes in the existence of aliens. Inoki, known for his political achievements and unique appearance, has a history of promoting wrestling and has even attempted to replicate Dennis Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea."

11366," A woman left an explosives-laden handbag near a bus at the Bauchi Motor Park in Gombe, Nigeria, around 8:30 p.m., resulting in an explosion that killed five people and injured more than a dozen others. The bus was heading to Jos, and the woman, who pretended to be waiting for the bus to fill up, disappeared moments before the explosion.

The passage also references past diplomatic challenges, such as the 2009 Cartagena summit and the 2009 meeting with Hugo Chavez, and emphasizes the importance of clear vision and articulation of democratic values. It concludes with the suggestion that Obama has an opportunity to align the goals of the U.S. with those of Latin America, particularly in supporting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, to leave a lasting legacy in the region."
11384," The passage describes the pervasive issue of sexual harassment in India, focusing on the experiences of women in public spaces and the workplace. It highlights the prevalence of various forms of harassment, including groping, stalking, and inappropriate comments, and the societal tendency to overlook these acts as ""normal."" The author shares their personal experience of harassment at the age of 13 and the lasting impact it has had on them.

The passage also discusses the cultural and systemic barriers that prevent women from reporting harassment, such as fear of shame, family disrepute, and the reluctance of authorities to take complaints seriously. It emphasizes the importance of acknowledging harassment as unacceptable and the potential power women hold in shifting the culture around sexual harassment.

The author cites two high-profile cases in India where women spoke out against powerful men, resulting in significant consequences for the perpetrators. These cases serve as examples of the potential for change when women find the courage to report harassment. The passage concludes with a call to action, urging women to speak up and find allies to help overcome the barriers to reporting harassment."
11395," Mountaineers have resumed climbing Mount Everest for the 2015 season, following a deadly 2014 season where 16 Nepali Sherpas were killed in an avalanche. The April 18 accident, the deadliest in Everest's history, prompted debates about the risks faced by Sherpas and the dangers of climbing Everest. To reduce risks, the route through Khumbu Icefall, where the avalanche occurred, has been changed to a safer but longer central route. Nepal has issued 347 permits for climbers this year, a slight increase from last year. The new route means climbers will have to cross more crevasses and use more ladders, but it is expected to be safer. However, some climbers, like Alpenglow Expeditions, have chosen to climb from the Chinese side of Everest, where there is no icefall, due to safety concerns. The shift to the Chinese side has raised concerns among Nepali companies that rely on tourism dollars. Despite the risks, several mountaineers, including Jon Reiter, are returning to Everest this year. Reiter, who was spared from the avalanche last year, is heading back to base camp this year."
11400," The text discusses the growing trend of self-testing for health, particularly through blood tests, and its potential implications. It highlights the advice of public figures like Mark Cuban and Taylor Swift, as well as legislative changes in Arizona, to promote personal health monitoring. However, it cautions against the overuse of such tests, pointing out the risks of false alarms, unnecessary procedures, and anxiety. The text also references the potential for increased healthcare costs and the need for regulation to prevent misuse of diagnostic tests. It concludes by advocating for education about the limitations of medical data and the importance of informed decision-making in health testing."
11410," Canadian fighter jets conducted their first airstrike against ISIS in Syria, targeting a garrison near Raqqa, the group's de facto capital. The CF-18 Hornets successfully hit the target, marking Canada's expansion of airstrikes into Syria as part of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS. The mission, which followed similar strikes in Iraq since November, was declared a success, with Canadian aircraft and crews returning safely. The airstrike's impact on ISIS forces remains unclear."
11768," A set of female quintuplets was born in Houston on April 8, marking the first such birth in the world since 1969. The Busby family, including parents Danielle and Adam and big sister Blayke, welcomed Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate, and Riley Paige via C-section at 28 weeks and two days. The Busbys are documenting their experience on their blog, ""It's a Buzz World."" In other quintuplet news, the Rademachers, who were hoping for a second child, kept the gender of their twins, Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith, a secret from family and friends. The couple recorded their family's reactions to meeting the twins, which were uploaded to YouTube and have been viewed over 700,000 times."
11779," The U.S. government has revised its policy for individuals on the no-fly list, now informing them of their status and allowing them to dispute it. This change follows a federal judge's ruling that the old process violated due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. The revised policy, part of a settlement in an ACLU lawsuit, provides more transparency but still falls short of constitutional requirements, according to the ACLU. The new process allows individuals to request detailed information about why they are on the list and to dispute their status in writing, with the possibility of a final decision from the Transportation Security Administration. The number of people on the no-fly list, managed by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, remains classified."
11791," A Texas veterinarian, Dr. Kristen Lindsey, sparked outrage after posting a photo on Facebook showing her smiling while holding a dead cat by an arrow through its head, with a caption boasting about the act. The cat was reportedly the pet of an elderly couple, not a feral animal as Lindsey claimed. The clinic she worked for fired her, distanced itself from her actions, and is now dealing with the fallout. Animal rights activists are pushing for charges, while some supporters defend her as a good vet despite her poor judgment. The investigation is ongoing, and Lindsey could face charges for animal cruelty."
11795," A mother in Baltimore became an online sensation after being captured on video by CNN affiliate WMAR disciplining her son for reportedly participating in the riots. The woman, dressed in light blue jeans, a yellow lace tunic, and a cropped yellow jacket, was seen smacking her son in the head and yelling at him to get over to her. The boy, dressed in dark pants, a black hoodie, and a dark backpack, was initially wearing a mask but eventually turned toward his mother with his face uncovered.

11808," The passage describes the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in Nepal, focusing on the experiences of a small village community, Ravi Opi, located 30 kilometers east of Kathmandu. The earthquake has caused significant damage to infrastructure, including major cracks in the main highway and destruction of homes, leaving many residents displaced and fearful of aftershocks. The community is struggling with limited aid and support, with residents expressing fear and uncertainty about their future. The story highlights the personal tragedy of one family, the Koiraba family, who lost their 2-year-old daughter in the quake. The narrative underscores the widespread impact of the disaster and the urgent need for aid and support in the affected areas."
11817," Marvel Comics superhero Hawkeye, portrayed by Jeremy Renner, showcased his hidden talent for singing Ed Sheeran parodies on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.""

Hawking's version is available for download, and he has also featured on the Pink Floyd song ""Talkin' Hawkin'."""
11838," The passage recounts the author's personal experience of witnessing the Miami riots in 1980 at the age of 12, sparked by the acquittal of police officers in the beating death of Arthur McDuffie. It draws parallels to other major race riots in U.S. history, such as those in Harlem (1964), Watts (1965), Newark (1967), and Detroit (1967), highlighting the role of perceived police brutality and systemic injustices in triggering these events. The author reflects on the controversial view that riots can serve as a form of protest, forcing societal attention to racial and economic inequalities, as exemplified by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s statements on the necessity of addressing root causes of unrest. The text also discusses the author's participation in a panel on civil rights and the lessons learned about the complexities of riots as both destructive and potentially catalytic for change. It concludes with a call for nonviolent protest and societal reform, referencing the peaceful protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and the Justice Department's recommendations following the Michael Brown case."
11839," The Israeli military conducted airstrikes in the Golan Heights on Sunday night, targeting a group of militants attempting to plant a bomb on the Israeli border. The Israel Defense Forces reported that the airstrikes were carried out against four militants who crossed into the area from Syria.

11858," The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a severe outbreak of HIV in rural Scott and Jackson counties in Indiana, primarily among users of the prescription opioid Opana. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases and six more with preliminary positive test results. The outbreak has been ongoing since mid-December, and the CDC and state health leaders have been working to control the spread of the disease. The outbreak has highlighted the challenges of addressing public health issues in rural areas with limited health resources. The state has declared a public health emergency, and Indiana University has sent health volunteers to provide a weekly clinic and educate the population about the dangers of needle sharing. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence has extended a 30-day executive order that allows for a needle exchange, which has been shown to reduce new infections. The outbreak has also raised concerns about the spread of other diseases, such as hepatitis C, which has seen a 150% increase between 2010 and 2013, primarily among injection drug abusers. The situation in Indiana serves as a warning about the potential for infectious diseases to spread rapidly, especially in areas with limited health resources and high rates of drug abuse."
11860," A longtime friend of Joni Mitchell has filed a legal petition to be named the singer-songwriter's conservator. Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: ""At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs."" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. ""Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital."" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that ""the website"" was accurate. A doctor's capacity declaration stated that Mitchell will likely be unable, due to her medical condition, to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months."
11870," The passage discusses the potential conflicts of interest involving the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. It highlights concerns about foreign donors to the foundation and questions whether these donations influenced State Department decisions, such as the endorsement of the Keystone XL pipeline. The passage also mentions the financial struggles of the foundation, including deficits and internal management issues. Despite these concerns, the passage suggests that voters may prioritize other issues, such as unemployment and education, over the efficiency and ethics of the Clinton charities.

11877," Google's Waze app, which uses GPS navigation and crowdsourcing, allows users to pinpoint the location of police officers in the field. While the app is primarily used to avoid traffic tickets, it poses a significant risk to law enforcement officers. In 2014, ambush attacks on police officers were the leading cause of felonious deaths among law enforcement officers in the line of duty. The app's ""traffic cop"" feature, which alerts users to the presence of law enforcement, can be used by criminals to target police officers. Despite the potential risks, Google has refused to discuss the matter with law enforcement organizations. The company's refusal to address the concerns of the National Sheriffs' Association, an organization representing more than 3,000 sheriff's offices across the United States, has offended many in the law enforcement community."
11888," Simon Brann Thorpe's ""Toy Soldiers"" project uses Western Sahara's harsh desert landscape as a backdrop for soldiers posed as green plastic figurines, similar to popular toys. The project aims to provide a fresh perspective on war and conflict, challenging viewers to develop their own emotional, physical, and political responses. Thorpe's background in landscape photography contributes to the powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert, with all locations chosen being historic battle sites between Morocco and the Polisario Front. The project involved working with the Polisario Front military, positioning about 50-60 soldiers at a time, and spending nights under the stars. Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions about how images of war will be consumed in the future, given the diminishing attention spans and competition for them."
11900," A gunman shot and killed Ron Lane, a longtime employee, in the print shop on the third floor of a building at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina.

Kentucky, undefeated at 38-0 entering the game, struggled to score in the final minutes, going five minutes without a point. Wisconsin will face Duke, who defeated Michigan State 81-61, in the championship game. The Blue Devils, led by Justise Winslow's 19 points and Jahlil Okafor's 18, dominated the Spartans with strong defense and efficient offense."
11911," Saudi Arabia initiated airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen following the rebels' seizure of power and the government's ousting from the capital. The operation, dubbed Decisive Storm, aimed to restore the Yemeni government, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda. After a month of airstrikes, Saudi Arabia announced the end of Decisive Storm and the start of Operation Renewal of Hope, focusing on the political process. However, airstrikes resumed shortly after rebel forces attacked a Yemeni military brigade. The Houthis have called for peace talks but insist on a complete halt of attacks. The conflict has also seen U.S. drone strikes against al Qaeda militants in Yemen, with the U.S. stressing the importance of freedom of navigation and maritime security in the region."
11922," The Iraqi city of Ramadi, located 70 miles west of Baghdad, is under siege by ISIS militants, with fierce fighting engulfing the area. Falih Essawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, has warned that ISIS could take the city within hours and has called for reinforcements and air support. The situation is dire, with security rapidly collapsing, and at least 10 Iraqi security forces killed and over 100 wounded in the fighting. ISIS has made significant advances in several areas around Ramadi, and the city has been a focal point of intense fighting for months. The U.S.-led coalition has conducted airstrikes in the area, but the fall of Ramadi is not imminent, according to a U.S. military official. The ongoing conflict has caused a significant number of refugees to flee the city, with at least 150,000 people having left since Wednesday morning."
11932," Hillary Clinton should announce on Equal Pay Day that, if elected, she will take a 23% pay cut in solidarity with working women in America and won't accept a raise until the gender wage gap is closed. This symbolic gesture would highlight the 23% wage disparity between men and women nationwide and demonstrate her commitment to addressing the issue. The announcement would also serve as a populist move, aligning with her campaign's focus on ordinary Americans and the need for change."
11945," This passage describes the brutal treatment of women by modern Jihadi groups like ISIS and Boko Haram, highlighting how they use women as part of their strategy to build a caliphate. Women are captured, enslaved, and subjected to sexual violence, forced marriage, and oppressive restrictions. Unlike previous jihadist groups, these organizations actively incorporate women into their societal structures, viewing them as essential for establishing a functioning community under their brutal interpretation of Islamic law. The passage also notes the strategic use of rape as a weapon of war and the devastating impact on women's lives in areas controlled by these groups."
11948," SpaceX, a private space exploration company founded by Elon Musk, is attempting to land the bottom stage of a Falcon 9 rocket upright on a platform in the Atlantic Ocean after launching it from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station. The goal is to reduce the cost of space access by reusing rockets, similar to how airplanes are reused. The mission includes delivering over 4,300 pounds of supplies to the space station using the Dragon spacecraft, which will later return to Earth with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash, and other items. The Dragon will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off California. This is SpaceX's sixth mission to the International Space Station."
11979," The Boston Marathon bombing trial has concluded its testimony phase, with federal prosecutors presenting a compelling case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused of setting off a bomb that killed three people and injured many others. The defense has argued that Tsarnaev was under the influence of his older brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police days after the attack. The jury has been deliberating for over seven hours but has yet to reach a verdict. The trial will proceed to a second phase, the penalty phase, if Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts. The defense has maintained that Tsarnaev, who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, fell under the sway of his older, more radicalized brother."
12008," The text explores the declining interest in marriage among millennials, influenced by cultural, economic, and personal factors. It highlights that many millennials prioritize career, travel, and financial stability over traditional marriage and family life. Economic concerns, such as student debt, also play a significant role in delaying or avoiding marriage. The text also references Scandinavian attitudes toward marriage, where cohabitation and childbearing outside of marriage are common and socially accepted. The author reflects on their own journey to marriage later in life and ponders whether a society without marriage could be just as well off."

The offensive, which included U.S.-led airstrikes, resulted in the dismantling of hundreds of IEDs and the destruction of ISIS shelters. The victory sets the stage for Iraqi forces to attempt the retaking of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Concerns remain about potential reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population and the behavior of Iranian-backed militias."
12068," The Red Cross has called for a 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen to allow for the delivery of essential supplies and medical aid to the wounded and displaced. The U.N. Security Council met to discuss the situation, but no decision was announced. The conflict has resulted in a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of casualties and many more at risk of dying without immediate assistance. The situation is further complicated by the presence of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has taken advantage of the chaos to carry out attacks and free prisoners. The international community is struggling to find a solution to the crisis, with calls for a ceasefire and political talks between the warring factions."
12073," A New York Police Department detective, Patrick Cherry, has apologized for an angry exchange with an Uber driver that was caught on video and went viral. The incident occurred when the Uber driver gestured to the detective, who was in an unmarked car, to use his blinker while parking.

The detective has been placed on modified assignment pending an investigation, and the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau is looking into the incident. The detective has apologized to the police commissioner, the driver, and the passengers, and has expressed regret for his behavior.

The maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax will rise to $168,600. Beneficiaries will receive notices in early December, with an average benefit increase of over $50 per month. The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) estimates that a 3.2% COLA would increase the average monthly retiree benefit by $57.30."
13815," Tonee Turner, a 22-year-old Pittsburgh artist, was last seen on December 30, 2019, at Dobra Tea, a tea room in the city.

Anyone with information is urged to contact the Pittsburgh Police at 412-323-7800 or their local authorities immediately."
13816," Xanax, or alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine commonly prescribed for anxiety relief. It works by enhancing the effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that calms brain activity. Xanax is effective for short-term use, providing rapid relief for acute anxiety episodes. However, long-term use can lead to tolerance, requiring higher doses for the same effect, and increasing the risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. For chronic anxiety, alternative treatments such as therapy, lifestyle changes, and other medications may be more sustainable. Xanax should be used cautiously and under professional guidance, with a holistic approach to anxiety management being the most effective strategy."
13823," The Pentagon has deployed U.S. Army troops from Fort Cavazos in Killeen and Fort Bliss in El Paso to the Middle East to protect U.S. troops from drone and rocket attacks. The soldiers from Fort Bliss will operate a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, while those from Fort Cavazos will serve as air defense headquarters elements. The deployment is part of a broader effort involving 900 troops from various bases, including Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Fort Liberty, North Carolina. The troops are not going to Israel and are intended to support regional deterrence efforts and bolster U.S. force protection capabilities."
13827," Big Brother 25 spoilers suggest that the house wants Bowie Jane to backdoor Cameron Hardin, whom they view as a competition threat. However, Bowie is hesitant to target Cameron, as she is more focused on eliminating Felica Cannon and Cirie Fields, who she sees as threats to her game. Cory Wurtenberger has also approached Bowie about backdooring Cameron, but she is not interested in naming him as a replacement nominee. The Power of Veto competition will be held on Saturday evening, and the nominations will stay the same if Bowie, Jag, or Matt wins. If America Lopez, Cirie, or Felica wins, Bowie will have to name a replacement nominee, which could provide an opportunity to take a shot at Cory."
13829," Big Brother 25 saw Cameron Hardin, known for winning challenges and struggling with social connections, evicted in Week 10. His backdoor eviction was a united house decision, with Felicia Cannon notably accusing him of having an ""evil spirit.""

The three-inch implant, called HAMMR, will deliver immunotherapy drugs in a closed-loop system, continuously monitoring the patient's cancer and adjusting the dose in real-time. The technology, which could potentially eradicate cancer in as little as 60 days, is expected to begin human trials within five years, starting with recurrent ovarian cancer. The implant's ability to provide real-time data from the tumor environment and deliver precise drug administration could lead to more effective and personalized treatments for a broad range of peritoneal cancers."
13848," The Miami Dolphins are exploring trade options for Chase Young, a defensive lineman from the Washington Commanders, to address their need for consistent pressure on the quarterback. Despite the return of key players from injury, the Dolphins' defensive line has struggled to generate sacks, with Emmanuel Ogbah underperforming this season. Young, who has 5 sacks this season, is five years younger than Ogbah and could provide a significant upgrade to the Dolphins' defensive line. However, trading for Young would require the Dolphins to address their cap situation and potentially sign him to a long-term extension."
13850," In 1988, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) identified the remains of Chong Un Kim, a 26-year-old Korean immigrant, found in a Jenkins County dumpster.

The USCIS has implemented measures to expedite work permit applications, including education sessions, email and SMS alerts, and mobile biometric services. However, the agency's funding is limited and Congress should provide additional support to enable the processing of more work permits and TPS applications."
13874," China has launched its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines, enhancing its naval power projection capabilities and signaling a significant shift in its military strategy. These submarines, equipped with land-attack cruise missiles, mark a major advancement in China's ability to conduct precision strikes against land targets.

Corinthian, once enrolling over 70,000 students, is among the worst ""predator colleges,"" offering dubious degrees, burdening students with high debt, and consuming billions in federal funds annually. The U.S. Department of Education's decision to limit Corinthian's access to federal student aid last summer likely contributed to its closure.

Corinthian's aggressive recruitment tactics, including making hundreds of calls daily, have been widely criticized. The closure of Corinthian and other for-profit colleges is necessary to prevent further exploitation of students and to ensure that education serves as a pathway to a middle-class life."
