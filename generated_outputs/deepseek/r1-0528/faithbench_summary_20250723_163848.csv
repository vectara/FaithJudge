1.  **Attack Details:** Militants armed with guns and grenades attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul. They gained entry after detonating explosives at the gate and opened fire on staff and patients.
2.  **Resolution:** Commandos landed on the hospital roof and killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting.
3.  **Claim & Denial:** The so-called Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack. The Taliban denied any involvement.
4.  **Casualties:** More than 50 people were wounded, according to the defence ministry.
5.  **Condemnation:** President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, stating it ""trampled all human values"" and that hospitals are regarded as immune sites in all religions.
6.  **Timeline & Witness:** The attack began at 09:00 local time. A staff member witnessed an attacker disguised in a white coat opening fire.
7.  **Tactical Shift:** This attack marks a change in IS approach in Afghanistan. It's their first direct engagement with security forces in Kabul (previously targeting civilians/Shia gatherings) and they used a Taliban-associated tactic (blowing gates open). This suggests they may have increased resources and training.
8.  **IS Context in Afghanistan:** IS has been active in Afghanistan for two years, mainly in the east near Pakistan, struggling to widen its base. The government claims it has rooted them out of some eastern bases but not mountainous areas. The passage notes IS's history of attacks in the region since 2015.
9.  **Aftermath:** TV showed people hiding on window ledges. The interior ministry confirmed the operation ended over six hours later with all attackers dead. IS-affiliated media shared images from the attack. Deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah condemned the attack and vowed revenge."

2.  **Shortlist Composition:** The shortlist consists of three British writers (including former winner Howard Jacobson), two Americans, and one Australian (Richard Flanagan).
3.  **Shortlisted Authors & Books:**
    *   **Neel Mukherjee (British?):** *The Lives of Others* (5/2 favourite), set in 1960s Calcutta, focusing on family secrets and political activism.
    *   **Howard Jacobson (British):** *J* (3/1 in betting), a futuristic love story set in a world where the past is taboo. He won the prize in 2010.
    *   **Ali Smith (British):** *How To Be Both*, featuring two interlinking stories set in different centuries, allowing the reader to choose the starting point. She has been shortlisted twice before.
    *   **Joshua Ferris (American):** *To Rise Again at a Decent Hour*, exploring atheism through a New York dentist who finds fake online accounts in his name.
    *   **Karen Joy Fowler (American):** *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves*, narrated by a college student about her family, including a ""surprisingly special"" sibling. It is the best-selling shortlisted book (over 55,000 copies sold).
    *   **Richard Flanagan (Australian):** *The Narrow Road to the Deep North*, a love story set against the construction of the Thailand-Burma Death Railway in WWII. He is the only non-British Commonwealth representative.
4.  **Sales Information:** Fowler's novel is the best-seller (over 55,000 copies). Ferris's novel has sold just over 6,000 copies. Sales spiked for all shortlisted books after the announcement (e.g., Mukherjee's sales jumped from 97 to 507 copies per week).
5.  **Critical Opinion:** A professor criticizes the shortlist as ""weak,"" noting notable omissions. He believes Jacobson's *J* is the strongest but fears reluctance to award him again so soon after Mantel's double win. Jacobson's book was also negatively featured in a ""Top 10 Unfinishable Novels"" list, reviving debate about judging criteria (""literary merit"" vs. ""readable"").
6.  **Logistics:** Shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition. The Duchess of Cornwall will present the prize.

1.  **Decision:** Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, announced an unexpected one-year extension to his term (until 2019), surprising those who expected him to either leave in 2018 or extend until 2021.
2.  **Primary Reason:** The decision was driven entirely by personal family circumstances. His daughters face important educational milestones (A-levels and GCSEs) in 2018, and his family planned to return to Canada then. He stated the role requires ""total attention and devotion,"" and managing his family life was the key factor.
3.  **Rejected Factors:** The passage explicitly dismisses other possible reasons:
    *   It was *not* due to political pressure (e.g., from the Prime Minister who wanted a longer extension).
    *   It was *not* due to disillusionment with Brexit economic predictions or criticism of the Bank's forecasts.
    *   It was *not* related to government policy.
4.  **Professional Context:** While Carney recognized the professional challenge of leaving during the Brexit negotiations (expected to be underway in 2018), he only felt able to extend for one year. By 2019, the Article 50 process (formal Brexit negotiation period) should be complete."
