14-0,"# Summary of Hospital Attack in Afghanistan

Islamic State (IS) militants attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Afghanistan, using explosives to breach a gate before opening fire on staff and patients. Afghan commandos killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The attack left more than 50 people wounded, while the Taliban denied involvement. According to security analysts, this assault marks a tactical shift for IS in Afghanistan, as they directly engaged with security forces in Kabul rather than targeting civilian gatherings as in previous attacks. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as trampling ""all human values."" This incident is part of IS's expanding presence in Afghanistan since declaring its ""Khorasan Province"" in 2015, following several other major attacks in the country, including bombings at a rally, a mosque, and the Supreme Court."

14-2,"# Mark Carney's Decision to Extend Bank of England Term by One Year

Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing he would extend his tenure by just one year beyond his original 2018 end date, rather than staying until 2021 or departing as initially planned. This decision was primarily driven by family considerations - in 2018, two of his daughters will be completing important educational milestones (A-levels and GCSEs), making it an ideal time for his family to return to Canada.

From a professional standpoint, Carney recognized that departing in 2018 would place his exit in the middle of Brexit negotiations. By extending to 2019, he would remain until the Article 50 process should be complete, providing stability during this critical period while allowing a new Governor to guide Britain's economic future afterward.

Despite speculation about political tensions or reaction to Brexit criticism, those close to Carney maintain his decision was personal, though he acknowledged the role ""requires total attention and devotion"" which he intended to provide as long as possible."

The passage describes three main hacker groups operating in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by programmer Yevhen Dokukin, support Ukraine by hacking Russian government servers, using DDoS attacks against rebel websites, disrupting separatist funding channels, and accessing CCTV systems in rebel-held areas. They share obtained data with Ukrainian authorities.

On the pro-Russian side, Cyber Berkut (named after riot police used against Kiev protesters) targets Ukrainian government websites with anti-Western messaging. Their claimed activities include hacking during Biden's visit to Kiev, compromising electronic billboards, disrupting vote-counting systems, and leaking alleged documents about Ukrainian military operations.

The third group, Anonymous International (also known as ""Humpty Dumpty""), primarily publishes leaked Kremlin documents. Their Ukraine-related activities include releasing a letter from a Russian fighter suggesting locals didn't support separatists and leaking emails from a key rebel commander. Their website is blocked in Russia."

15-3,"# Study Reveals Significant Increase in Heavy Drinking Among Americans

A University of Washington study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that heavy drinking among Americans rose 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, with women's drinking rates increasing dramatically. The study, which tracked adult drinking patterns at the county level, revealed that 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers in 2012.

Women's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times the rate of men over the decade. For example, in Santa Clara County, California, women's binge drinking rose by nearly 36% compared to 23% for men.

Geographic variations were significant, with binge drinking rates ranging from 6% (Madison County, Idaho) to 36% (Menominee, Wisconsin). Alcohol abuse contributed to approximately 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010, with estimated costs exceeding $220 billion annually.

Experts attribute these increases to changing social norms for women, affluent populations in tech-heavy areas, cheaper alcohol in real terms, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies."

16-0,"# Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran: A Historic Boxing Rematch

The passage describes the significance of the 1980 rematch between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, positioned as one of boxing's most important fights in a series examining historically significant bouts. After losing a controversial first fight to Duran in Montreal, Leonard changed tactics for their November 25, 1980 rematch in New Orleans, using his superior speed and movement rather than engaging in a slugfest. Duran became increasingly frustrated as Leonard danced and jabbed, culminating in the infamous eighth round when Duran turned his back and quit, saying ""no mas"" (no more). This shocking surrender damaged Duran's reputation in Panama, though he eventually redeemed himself by winning the light-middleweight title in 1983. Leonard, who won their third fight in 1989, considered forcing Duran to quit a greater achievement than knocking him out. The passage frames this historic matchup as part of boxing's golden age in the middleweight divisions."
16-1,"# Rory McIlroy Eyes Masters Victory to Complete Career Grand Slam

Rory McIlroy believes it is ""unthinkable"" that he won't win the Masters during his career to complete the career grand slam. The 25-year-old world number one would join an elite group of only five other golfers (Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods) who have achieved this feat.

McIlroy considers his 2011 Augusta collapse—where he lost a four-shot lead with a final-round 80—to be ""the most important day"" of his career because of what he learned from it. He quickly rebounded to win the US Open two months later and has since added victories in the PGA Championship and The Open.

Despite having only one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, McIlroy feels Augusta is a course where he could potentially win multiple times. He views the golf course as his ""sanctuary"" from the pressure and hype surrounding major tournaments, particularly after navigating personal challenges during his successful previous season."

A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London—one of Britain's most expensive areas—is listed for sale at just £575,000, significantly below market value because it has only three years remaining on its lease.

10-0,"# Russian Su-24 Black Box Opened in Moscow

The black box of the Russian Su-24 jet shot down by Turkey was opened in Moscow before journalists and diplomats. Russian investigator Nikolai Primak reported that flight information appeared to be missing, with analysis results expected next week. The data could help resolve disputes over the jet's location when it was hit on November 24. Turkey claims the jet ignored warnings to leave its airspace, while Russia maintains it was shot down within Syrian airspace. The incident has severely damaged Russia-Turkey relations, with Russia imposing economic sanctions including a tourism ban. Both pilot and navigator ejected; the pilot was killed while the navigator was rescued. A Russian marine involved in rescue operations was also killed. Russia demands an apology from Turkey while sanctions continue."

10-4,"# Eugene Awarded 2021 IAAF World Championships

Eugene, United States, has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships. The IAAF Council bypassed the usual bidding process, calling it a ""unique strategic opportunity"" to bring the championships to the USA for the first time. Eugene had previously lost its bid for the 2019 event to Doha, Qatar. IAAF President Lamine Diack explained that the decision was strategic, taking advantage of strong support from public authorities, the private sector, the National Olympic Committee, NBC, and the public. This is not unprecedented, as the 2007 championships in Osaka, Japan were also awarded without a formal bidding process."

L/Bdr Parkinson, a serviceman seriously injured in a 2006 Afghanistan bombing, gained significant attention after carrying the Olympic torch on June 26. Despite suffering a brain injury that affected his speech, he has maintained his personality and sense of humor, now speaking unaided and walking with crutches after dedicated rehabilitation. Since his torch relay appearance, he has received over 5,000 Facebook friend requests, reaching the platform's limit for personal profiles. His mother Diane described the ""phenomenal"" response, including thousands of website visits, mail, emails, and requests for torch visits, which have greatly lifted his spirits.

Parkinson spends his time raising money for military charities and serves as patron of the Pilgrim Bandits organization."
13-1,"# Summary of Poldark TV Episode

The passage discusses a significant time jump in the TV show Poldark, where character Demelza Poldark gives birth in tomorrow night's episode despite barely showing her pregnancy in the previous episode. Within the first ten minutes, Ross Poldark (played by Aidan Turner) is shown with his newborn daughter. The timeline appears compressed and inconsistent - the previous episode ended with Demelza announcing her pregnancy, while the new episode starts with her eight months pregnant and quickly giving birth. Fans have noticed this inconsistency, with one tweeting about how pregnancies in Poldark seem to progress extremely rapidly. This isn't the first accelerated pregnancy in the show, as another character previously went to full term between episodes. Despite the timeline issues, the episode reinforces Ross's deep love for Demelza, showing that the heartthrob character is ""well and truly off the market."""
13-2,"# Summary of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in the UK

According to new figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 272 children with fetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalized in England last year. Experts warn this represents only a fraction of affected children. World Health Organization research suggests approximately 1 in 100 UK babies (roughly 7,500 annually) may suffer from learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to alcohol exposure in the womb.

The condition causes permanent disabilities, with Elizabeth Mitchell from the National Organisation for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome describing it as ""vastly under-diagnosed."" The case of 15-year-old Niamh Brown illustrates the lifelong impacts, as she requires assistance with daily tasks and will never live independently.

While current government guidance allows pregnant women limited alcohol consumption (maximum two units twice weekly), some experts believe pregnant women should abstain completely from alcohol."
13-3,"# Summary: Scotland Women's Football Team Nears Euro Qualification

Scotland's women's football team has won all five qualifiers and could secure their tournament spot with a victory against Iceland at Falkirk Stadium. Forward Lisa Evans (24) from Bayern Munich expressed the emotional stakes, having experienced heartbreaking play-off losses for Euro 2013 and the World Cup.

Iceland, ranked 20th globally (one above Scotland), is also unbeaten after four matches. The upcoming fixtures between these teams will likely determine who tops the group, though six of eight group runners-up will also qualify automatically for next summer's finals in the Netherlands.

The current Scottish squad features 12 of 20 players competing internationally, including BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Evans recently won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich in her first season there, celebrating alongside stars from the men's team. She believes the diverse international experience of the Scottish players brings valuable skills and perspectives to the national team as they pursue their first major finals appearance."

A light aircraft touched down at Aero Acres airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida without deploying its landing gear, causing it to skid along the runway on its belly. The incident was captured on video showing the plane's propellers hitting the runway and its wings bouncing from impact. After realizing the mistake, the 85-year-old pilot Chris Georgaklis, who has nearly 50 years of flying experience, re-engaged the engines and took off again. Remarkably, despite the damaged propellers, Georgaklis managed to fly 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale where he landed safely with his dog Buddy.

12-0,"# Summary: Rare Omura's Whale Found in Western Australia

An Omura's whale, a species once feared extinct, was discovered washed up on a remote beach in Exmouth, Western Australia, after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This marks the first sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff initially had difficulty identifying the 5.68-meter juvenile female, ultimately confirming its species through DNA profiling.

Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the discovery ""highly significant"" as very little is known about Omura's whales, which were first scientifically described only in 2003. Typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, these whales have a sleek body shape and unique skeletal features. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton in a few years for further scientific investigation and possible museum display."

12-3,"# Earthquake in Northern Italy

A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 35km north of Lucca, Italy at a depth of 15.5km. The tremor, with its epicenter in Garfagnana, was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, with no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Following the quake, aftershocks occurred, phone lines went down, power was cut in affected areas, and schools were evacuated as a precaution. Italy has a history of seismic activity, including a 2009 L'Aquila earthquake that killed nearly 300 people, and two earthquakes in the same region last May that killed over 20 people. An INGV expert described this as a ""classic"" medium-strong earthquake for the region.

Though no longer in a medically induced coma, she remains unresponsive—not reacting to visitors or familiar voices, with her eyes not following people. This assessment contradicts Bobby Brown's recent statement that his daughter was ""awake"" and ""watching"" him. The Brown family attorney clarified that while her condition has improved and doctors indicate she will have a long life, she has begun rehabilitation, and ""the quality of her life will not be known for years to come.""
