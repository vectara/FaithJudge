14-0,"Here is a concise summary of the passage:

**The Attack**: Four militants attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan. One attacker detonated explosives at the hospital gate, then the group opened fire on staff and patients. The attackers were killed by commandos after several hours of fighting. Over 50 people were wounded.

**Attribution**: The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack. The Taliban denied involvement.

**Significance**: This marks a tactical shift for IS in Afghanistan - their first direct engagement with security forces in the capital. Previously, they had targeted civilian gatherings, particularly Shia Muslims.

**Context**: IS established its presence in Afghanistan in 2015 (declaring Khorasan Province) and has carried out multiple attacks since then, including:
- July 2016: ~80 killed in Kabul rally bombing
- November 2016: 30+ killed in Kabul mosque attack
- Recent Supreme Court attack: 22 killed

**Current Situation**: IS has been primarily active in eastern Afghanistan near the Pakistan border but appears to be expanding operations. The Taliban is also conducting attacks, having recently begun their Spring offensive.

**Response**: President Ashraf Ghani condemned the hospital attack as trampling ""all human values,"" noting hospitals are considered immune sites in all religions."

14-2,"Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, announced he would extend his term by one year until 2019, rather than leaving in 2018 as originally planned or staying until 2021. This decision surprised many who expected him to choose between the original 2018 departure date or a full eight-year term ending in 2021.

The key factor in Carney's decision was his family circumstances. In 2018, one of his four daughters will be finishing A-levels and another completing GCSEs, making it an ideal time for the family to return to Canada. Carney had taken office in 2013, before Brexit was a consideration.

The Brexit referendum result on June 23 created a dilemma for Carney - leaving in 2018 would mean departing during crucial EU exit negotiations. While he recognized the professional challenge and told colleagues he ""wanted to serve,"" he ultimately chose a compromise that would see him through the completion of the Article 50 process while allowing his family to return to Canada as planned.

Carney emphasized this was ""an entirely personal decision"" unrelated to government policy. Sources close to him dismissed suggestions of tension with Prime Minister Theresa May (who wanted him to stay until 2021) or that criticism of the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts influenced his decision."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, a prominent Sunday Times columnist since 1993, died after being diagnosed with cancer, which he described as the ""full English"" of cancers. The Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens called him ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper.

Gill was known for dictating his copy over the phone due to dyslexia and was praised for his brilliant, fearless writing style. His final column about his diagnosis will appear in the Sunday Times.

Throughout his career, Gill courted controversy with provocative articles, including shooting a baboon in Tanzania, making derogatory comments about the Welsh, and using offensive language about Clare Balding. He was once ejected from Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.

Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill studied art before becoming a writer in the 1980s. He was married twice - first to Cressida Connolly, then to current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with whom he had two children. His cancer diagnosis prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins.

Despite his controversial reputation, colleagues and fellow journalists paid tribute to him as a brilliant writer and kind man who never produced a boring sentence in his career."
14-4,"The passage describes cyber warfare activities related to the Ukraine conflict, focusing on three main hacking groups:

**Ukrainian Cyber Troops**: Led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin, this pro-Ukrainian group claims to have hacked Russian interior ministry servers and police email accounts. They use DDoS attacks to disable rebel websites, disrupt separatist funding through payment systems, monitor CCTV cameras in rebel areas, and hijacked printers to print pro-Ukrainian messages. Dokukin provided hacked data to Ukraine's security service, which volunteer group Inform Napalm analyzed, finding evidence of wounded Russian military servicemen being evacuated from Ukraine.

**Cyber Berkut**: An anti-Western, pro-Russian group named after riot police, opposing what they call Kiev's ""genocide."" They hacked Ukrainian government websites during VP Biden's visit, claiming to have retrieved US military assistance documents. Other claimed activities include hacking electronic billboards to show graphic anti-Ukrainian content, disrupting election vote-counting systems, leaking defense ministry data, and blocking President Poroshenko's website.

**Anonymous International (Shaltay Boltay/Humpty Dumpty)**: A Russian group known for publishing leaked Kremlin documents, though it's unclear if they hack or receive insider information. They published a letter from a Russian fighter suggesting locals don't support separatists and leaked emails from rebel commander Igor Strelkov. Their website is blocked in Russia.

All three groups present themselves as independent activists, though the passage notes uncertainty about their actual independence from government sponsorship."

15-3,"A major study by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that heavy drinking among Americans increased 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, with women driving much of this increase. The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, tracked drinking patterns at the county level for the first time.

Key findings include:
- In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers
- Women's binge drinking rates increased seven times faster than men's nationwide
- In Santa Clara County, California, women's binge drinking rose 36% compared to 23% for men
- Despite increased heavy drinking, overall alcohol consumption rates remained relatively stable

The study defined heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two for men, while binge drinking was defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion.

Geographic variations were significant, with binge drinking rates ranging from 6% in Madison County, Idaho to 36% in Menominee, Wisconsin. Heavy drinking ranged from 2% in Hancock County, Tennessee to 22% in Esmeralda County, Nevada.

Experts attribute the increases to changing social norms making it more acceptable for women to drink like men, cheaper alcohol prices relative to inflation, increased alcohol advertising ($3.45 billion spent in 2011), and weakened alcohol control policies. The study notes that alcohol-related deaths reached 88,600 in 2010, with excessive drinking costing over $220 billion annually."

16-0,"The passage discusses the upcoming Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight, describing it as potentially the biggest fight financially and most significant of this century. It then focuses on one of boxing's historic fights: the second bout between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran on November 25, 1980, in New Orleans.

In their first fight, Duran had controversially outpointed Leonard amid scoring confusion. For the rematch, Leonard changed tactics, using his speed and movement rather than engaging in a slugfest. This frustrated Duran throughout the fight. In the eighth round, after Leonard taunted him and landed a clean left to his face, Duran shocked the boxing world by turning his back and quitting, famously saying ""no mas"" (no more).

The incident stunned observers, as Duran was known as a fierce warrior. Though he claimed stomach cramps, his manager admitted he quit due to embarrassment. The loss damaged Duran's reputation in Panama until he rebuilt it three years later by winning the light-middleweight title. Leonard won their third fight in 1989 but considered making Duran quit his greatest achievement against him."
16-1,"Here's a concise summary of the passage:

Rory McIlroy, the world number one golfer, believes it's ""unthinkable"" that he won't win the Masters at some point to complete the career grand slam. At 25, he aims to become only the sixth player in history to win all four major titles, joining Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.

McIlroy views his 2011 Masters collapse, where he lost a four-shot final-round lead and finished with an 80, as the most important day of his career. He learned crucial lessons from that experience, which helped him win his first major at the US Open two months later. He has since won four majors total (US Open 2011, US PGA 2012, and both the Open and US PGA in 2014).

Despite having just one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, McIlroy remains confident about eventually winning at Augusta. He achieved his 2014 success while dealing with personal challenges, including calling off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki and a costly legal dispute with his former management company. He views the golf course as his ""sanctuary"" from external pressures and looks forward to using this approach at Augusta."

16-4,"A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, is being sold for £575,000 - significantly below market value for the exclusive area. However, the property has only three years remaining on its lease, making the effective cost £191,000 per year or £15,000 per month, comparable to rental prices in the area.

The 1,990 sq/ft maisonette on Egerton Place requires modernization and includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift access, parking, and communal garden. It's one of two similar properties being sold with short leases, with the second priced at £595,000.

If renovated and the lease extended, the property could be worth £6-7.5 million. However, extending the lease for 90 years would likely cost between £3.35-4.5 million. The current freeholder is believed to be the Welcome Trust.

Estate agents report high interest despite the unusual circumstances, with potential buyers including locals, developers, and end users. The building dates from 1893 and has housed notable residents including Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, son of Charles Dickens. Experts warn that while the price appears attractive, the lease extension premium makes it a complex investment opportunity."

An Omura's whale, a species once feared extinct, was discovered washed up on a remote beach in Exmouth, Western Australia, following Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This marks the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. The 5.68-meter juvenile female was initially difficult to identify, requiring DNA profiling for confirmation by Department of Parks and Wildlife staff.

The ""black box"" from a Russian Su-24 jet was opened in Moscow on Friday, with Russian investigators reporting that flight information appeared to be missing. The jet was shot down by Turkish F-16 fighters on November 24, causing a major diplomatic crisis between Russia and Turkey.

- Russia maintains the jet was in Syrian airspace when shot down

Casualties included:
- The pilot (killed by militants after ejecting)
- A Russian marine on a rescue mission
- A rescue helicopter was destroyed

The incident has led to:
- Severely damaged Russia-Turkey relations
- Russian sanctions against Turkey, including a ban on package holidays
- President Putin accusing Turkey of subservience to the US and ""creeping Islamisation""

Eugene had previously failed in its bid for the 2019 championships, which went to Doha, Qatar. However, a recent presentation convinced the IAAF of Eugene's capability to host the event.

IAAF President Lamine Diack explained that the decision was strategic, taking advantage of unprecedented cooperation between public authorities, private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and enthusiastic public support. He acknowledged this departed from normal procedure but emphasized the opportunity to access a key market for the sport's global development.

13-4,"A light aircraft made a belly landing at Aero Acres residential airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida, after the pilot failed to deploy the landing gear. The Aerostar plane touched down on its belly, with its propellers hitting and ricocheting off the runway while the wings bounced from impact. 

Upon realizing the mistake, the 85-year-old pilot Chris Georgaklis, who has nearly 50 years of flying experience, gave full throttle and managed to take off again despite the damaged propellers. He then flew 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale where he landed safely, accompanied by his dog Buddy.

The incident was captured on video by an observer who initially thought the plane was doing a fly-by before realizing it was attempting to land without landing gear. The most common cause of such ""gear-up"" or ""belly"" landings is pilot error, though mechanical failure can also be a factor. The FAA is investigating the incident."
