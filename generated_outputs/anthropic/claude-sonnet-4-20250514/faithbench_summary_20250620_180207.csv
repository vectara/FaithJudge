Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, announced he would extend his term by just one year until 2019, surprising many who expected him to either leave in 2018 as originally planned or stay until 2021. 

**Key points:**

- **Decision rationale**: The extension was primarily driven by personal family considerations rather than political or professional factors
- **Family timing**: Two of his four daughters will be completing A-levels and GCSEs in 2018, making it an ideal time for the family to return to Canada's education system
- **Brexit context**: While Carney recognized the professional difficulty of leaving during Brexit negotiations, he felt unable to commit to the full extension until 2021 with his family departing in 2018
- **Timeline alignment**: The one-year extension should allow the Article 50 Brexit process to complete, after which a new Governor will handle Britain's post-Brexit economic future
- **No political pressure**: Sources dismiss suggestions of tension with Prime Minister Theresa May, emphasizing this was entirely Carney's personal decision

The decision represents a compromise between professional duty during a critical period and family obligations."

16-0,"This passage discusses the historic boxing rivalry between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, presented as part of a series on fights that shaped boxing history. Here are the key points:

**Background**: Their fights helped launch the ""golden age of boxing"" in the middling weight divisions, featuring legendary fighters like Leonard, Duran, Thomas Hearns, and Marvin Hagler.

**First Fight**: Duran controversially defeated Leonard by unanimous decision in Montreal's Olympic Stadium, though the scoring was initially confused and later corrected due to a judge's mathematical error.

**Second Fight (November 25, 1980)**: The rematch in New Orleans' Louisiana Superdome became infamous when Duran quit mid-fight. Leonard changed tactics from the first bout, using his speed and movement instead of engaging in a slugfest. After more than seven rounds of frustration, Duran famously said ""no mas"" (no more) and walked away in the eighth round.

**Aftermath**: Duran's quitting shocked the boxing world and humiliated him in his home country of Panama, where he lost endorsements and public support. Though he claimed stomach cramps, his manager said he quit due to embarrassment. It took Duran three years to restore his reputation by winning the light-middleweight title in 1983.

**Legacy**: Leonard won their third fight in 1989 and considered forcing Duran to quit more satisfying than a knockout would have been."

Rory McIlroy believes it's ""unthinkable"" that he won't eventually win the Masters to complete golf's career Grand Slam. The 25-year-old world number one would become only the sixth player to achieve this feat, joining legends like Nicklaus and Woods.

- McIlroy has struggled at Augusta National with only one top-10 finish in six appearances
- His 2011 Masters collapse (leading by four shots, finishing with an 80) was a crucial learning experience that he calls ""the most important day of my career""
- He rebounded from that collapse to win the US Open two months later, then added three more majors (2012 PGA, 2014 Open and PGA)
- Despite personal challenges in 2014 (calling off his wedding and legal disputes), he found the golf course served as his ""sanctuary""
- McIlroy is confident he can win multiple Masters titles once he captures his first green jacket, viewing Augusta as a course where he can excel

The Northern Irishman emphasizes that completing the Grand Slam is now a career-long goal and expects to use the golf course as an escape from the mounting pressure and hype surrounding his Masters quest."

At age 75, Jack Nicklaus achieved a hole-in-one on the 130-yard fourth hole during Augusta National's par-3 contest, his first ace at the venue. Playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw, Nicklaus had jokingly predicted making a hole-in-one earlier that morning. His achievement was part of a record-tying day with five total aces, matching the 2002 record. Colombian golfer Camilo Villegas also made two holes-in-one (on the fourth and eighth holes) but lost the contest title to Kevin Streelman in a playoff. The passage notes Nicklaus's legendary career, including winning his first Masters green jacket in 1963 at the youngest age ever, his sixth in 1986, and being one of five golfers to complete the career grand slam."
11-3,"Here is a concise summary of the passage:

An Omura's whale, a species feared extinct, was discovered washed up on a remote beach in Exmouth, Western Australia, following Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This marked the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. The 5.68-meter juvenile female was initially difficult to identify and required DNA profiling for confirmation by Department of Parks and Wildlife staff.

The discovery is considered highly significant because little is known about Omura's whales, which were only first described scientifically in 2003. The species is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters around Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. These whales have distinctive features including a sleek body shape and unique skeletal characteristics with 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin.

The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton in several years for further scientific study and potential museum display. The findings will help improve field identification guides and understanding of the whale's regional distribution."

Russia opened the black box from a downed Su-24 jet in Moscow on Friday, but officials reported that flight data appeared to be missing. The jet was shot down by Turkish F-16 fighters on November 24, killing the pilot and a Russian marine during rescue operations, while the navigator survived.

The incident has created a major diplomatic crisis between Russia and Turkey, with both countries disputing where the jet was located when hit. Turkey claims the Russian aircraft ignored warnings to leave Turkish airspace, while Russia maintains it was shot down over Syrian territory.

Russia has imposed economic sanctions on Turkey, including banning package holidays that could cost Turkey billions. President Putin has accused Turkey of subservience to the US and ""creeping Islamisation."" Both countries are involved in Syria but hold opposing positions despite both claiming to oppose ISIS. Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey, and analysis of the black box data is expected next week."

An explosion at a chemical plant in Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, China injured six people and sparked a large fire. The plant produces paraxylene (PX), a potentially carcinogenic chemical used in polyester production. The blast occurred Monday night at an oil storage facility following an oil leak, with five people injured by broken glass and hospitalized. Over 600 firefighters responded and brought the fire under control by Tuesday morning. This is the plant's second explosion since July 2013. The facility was originally planned for Xiamen but was relocated to its current remote location in 2007 following public protests over pollution concerns. PX plants have been controversial in China, sparking demonstrations in multiple cities despite such protests being illegal."

Davina Ayrton (formerly David), now 34, was convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl in a Portsmouth garage in autumn 2004. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and changed her name in 2012, denied the charges. The victim testified she was attacked while two friends slept nearby, despite her shouting for Ayrton to stop. 

Judge Ian Pearson remanded Ayrton into custody at a male prison in Winchester ahead of sentencing on March 4, citing risks of self-harm and failure to appear. The court noted Ayrton had attempted suicide the previous summer, and special detention protocols were established. Ayrton disclosed the attack to a care home worker in 2014, which contributed to the case. The judge described it as an unusual and difficult case."

Eugene, United States has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships. The International Association of Athletics Federations Council bypassed the usual bidding process, citing a ""unique strategic opportunity"" to host the championships in the USA for the first time. Eugene had previously failed to secure the 2019 event, which went to Doha, Qatar instead. IAAF President Lamine Diack explained that the decision was strategic, allowing them to take advantage of aligned support from public authorities, private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and an enthusiastic public. The 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan was also awarded without a bidding process, establishing precedent for this approach."

L/Bdr Parkinson, who suffered a serious brain injury in a 2006 bomb attack in Afghanistan, carried the Olympic torch on June 26th in Doncaster. Despite losing his speech initially, he has recovered and now speaks unaided while maintaining his personality and humor. He currently spends 12 hours daily in gym and rehabilitation, walks with crutches, and raises money for military charities as patron of Pilgrim Bandits.

His torch-carrying appearance generated massive public response - over 5,000 Facebook friend requests (hitting the platform's limit), 19,000 page hits on a single update, hundreds of visit requests, and increased mail addressed simply to ""Ben, please Mr Postie."" His mother described the support as ""phenomenal,"" saying Ben is ""bouncing and buoyed up"" by the response. Facebook suggested he consider creating a public page instead of a personal profile due to his public figure status. The Olympic torch relay involves 8,000 carriers over 70 days and 8,000 miles, culminating in London's opening ceremony on July 27th."
13-1,"This passage discusses a recent episode of the TV show Poldark, where the character Demelza gives birth to a daughter within ten minutes of the episode's start. The main criticism centers on the show's unrealistic timeline - Demelza went from barely showing pregnancy in the previous week's episode to being eight months pregnant and then giving birth almost immediately in the current episode. 

The passage notes that Ross Poldark (played by Aidan Turner) has become popular with female viewers, though his character appears committed to Demelza despite originally marrying her out of duty. The rushed pregnancy timeline mirrors a similar issue with another character, Elizabeth, whose pregnancy also progressed unnaturally quickly between episodes. Fans have commented on social media about this recurring pattern of accelerated pregnancies in the show."

In England, 272 children with fetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalized last year due to brain damage from prenatal alcohol exposure. However, experts warn the actual number may be much higher - World Health Organization research suggests at least 1 in 100 UK babies (approximately 7,500 annually) could suffer learning, behavioral, and physical problems from alcohol exposure in the womb.

The condition is described as permanent and under-diagnosed. A case example involves 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who requires daily assistance, has no sense of danger, and will never live independently due to fetal alcohol syndrome from her birth mother's drinking.

Associated medical issues include liver, kidney and heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. While the government currently advises pregnant women to avoid alcohol or limit consumption to two units twice weekly maximum, experts advocate for complete abstinence during pregnancy."

Scotland's women's football team has won all five qualifiers and will host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday, with victory nearly securing their place in next summer's finals in the Netherlands. Both teams are unbeaten - Scotland with five wins and Iceland with four wins from four matches, ranked 20th and 19th in the world respectively.

Forward Evans (24, Bayern Munich) emphasizes the emotional significance after Scotland previously lost play-offs for Euro 2013 and last year's World Cup. The winner of Friday's match and the September 20 return fixture in Reykjavik will likely top the group, though Scotland is well-positioned to qualify automatically as one of the best six group runners-up.

The current squad includes 12 players based outside Scotland (5 in England, 4 in Sweden, 2 in the US), including BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Evans recently won the German Bundesliga with Bayern Munich in her first season and believes playing in top international leagues benefits the national team's development and competitiveness."

An 85-year-old pilot named Chris Georgaklis attempted to land his Aerostar aircraft at Aero Acres residential airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida, without deploying the landing gear. The plane belly-landed on the runway, with its propellers striking the ground and causing damage. After realizing his mistake, the pilot re-engaged the engines and took off again despite the damaged propellers. Remarkably, he successfully flew 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and landed safely, accompanied by his dog Buddy. Georgaklis, who has nearly 50 years of flying experience, managed this despite the high risk of engine failure from the propeller damage. The incident was captured on video, and the FAA is investigating. Gear-up landings typically result from pilot error (forgetting to deploy landing gear) or mechanical failure."

A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 35km north of Lucca, Italy at a depth of 15.5km. The tremor occurred at 15:48 local time with its epicenter in Garfagnana and was felt across a wide area including Milan, Florence, Bologna, and Modena. While there were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage, the quake caused power outages and phone line disruptions in the Garfagnana area, and schools were evacuated as a precaution.

Italy experiences frequent seismic activity, with notable recent earthquakes including a deadly 2009 L'Aquila quake that killed nearly 300 people and May 2012 tremors in the same region that left over 20 dead. The L'Aquila disaster led to controversial manslaughter convictions of six scientists and an official in 2012 for allegedly providing misleading safety assessments before the fatal earthquake."
