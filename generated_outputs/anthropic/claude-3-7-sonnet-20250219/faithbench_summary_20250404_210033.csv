14-0,"# Summary of Hospital Attack in Afghanistan

Islamic State militants attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul using explosives, guns, and grenades. Four attackers, who gained entry after detonating explosives at a gate, were killed by commandos after several hours of fighting. The attack resulted in multiple casualties with over 50 wounded. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as trampling ""all human values."" 

This marks a tactical shift for IS in Afghanistan, as they directly engaged security forces in Kabul rather than targeting civilian gatherings. Despite government claims of rooting out IS from bases in eastern Afghanistan, the group has continued to carry out significant attacks, including a July 2016 suicide bombing that killed about 80 people and a Supreme Court attack the previous month killing 22. The Taliban denied involvement in this hospital attack."

14-2,"# Summary of Mark Carney's Bank of England Term Extension

Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing a one-year extension to his term rather than either leaving in 2018 as originally planned or extending to 2021. This decision was primarily driven by family considerations. With two daughters finishing important educational milestones in 2018, his family planned to return to Canada that year. While Carney recognized the professional challenge of leaving during Brexit negotiations, he felt a one-year extension until 2019 would allow him to see through the Article 50 process while still accommodating his family's needs. He emphasized this was ""an entirely personal decision"" not reflecting any tension with Prime Minister Theresa May or reaction to criticism of the Bank's Brexit forecasts."

Adrian Gill, a prominent Sunday Times columnist, died after being diagnosed with what he called ""the full English"" of cancers. Known for his distinctive writing style, Gill was described by Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens as ""a giant among journalists"" and ""the heart and soul"" of the paper he joined in 1993.

Gill was renowned for his dazzling, fearless writing and for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia. While highly respected for his eloquence, his career was marked by controversy, including offensive comments about Wales, Norfolk, and the Isle of Man, and a censured review of Clare Balding.

Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill overcame dyslexia to become a writer, starting with art reviews before joining Tatler and then the Sunday Times. He was previously married to Cressida Connolly and later to current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, with whom he had two children. Before his death, he became engaged to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins."

15-3,"# Summary: Study on Rising Heavy Drinking in America

A University of Washington study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that heavy drinking among Americans increased 17.2% between 2005-2012, with binge drinking rates rising significantly, especially among women. The study, which tracked adult drinking at the county level, revealed that while 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers in 2012, the overall percentage of people who drink any alcohol remained stable.

Women's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times the rate of men's over the decade. Experts attribute this trend to changing social norms, affluence in certain regions, relatively cheaper alcohol prices, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. The research noted that alcohol was responsible for approximately 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010, with excessive drinking estimated to cost over $220 billion annually."

In the eighth round, after Leonard's psychological tactics and precise punches, Duran shockingly quit by turning his back and saying ""No mas"" (no more). This humiliating surrender damaged Duran's reputation in Panama, though he eventually redeemed himself by winning the light-middleweight title in 1983.

10-3,"# Summary of Court Case

A 34-year-old individual named Davina Ayrton (formerly David) was found guilty of raping a 15-year-old girl in a Portsmouth garage in autumn 2004. Despite denying the charge, Ayrton was remanded into custody at a male prison in Winchester and will be sentenced on March 4. Judge Ian Pearson noted this was an unusual case and deemed Ayrton a flight risk and danger to herself. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, changed her name in 2012 but had not made physical changes to her body. The victim reported shouting at Ayrton to stop the attack while two others slept nearby. In 2014, Ayrton confessed to the attack to a worker at her care home in Hampshire."

13-1,"# Summary of Passage

The passage discusses a rapid pregnancy timeline in the TV show Poldark. In tomorrow night's episode, Demelza Poldark gives birth to a daughter within the first ten minutes, despite barely showing in the previous episode. The timeline is notably compressed - Demelza announces her pregnancy at the end of the previous episode, then suddenly appears eight months pregnant at the start of the new episode, and gives birth minutes later with no indication of time passing. Fans have noticed this accelerated pregnancy, with one tweeting about how pregnancies in ""Poldark times"" seem to conclude ""in the next 10 minutes."" The passage also notes that this isn't the first time the show has used this technique, as another character named Elizabeth previously went through a full-term pregnancy between episodes. The passage also mentions that Ross Poldark (played by Aidan Turner) appears devoted to Demelza despite initially marrying her out of duty."
13-2,"# Summary: Foetal Alcohol Syndrome Hospitalizations in England

According to new figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 272 children disabled by foetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalized in England over the past year. However, experts warn the actual number affected is likely much higher. World Health Organisation research suggests at least 1 in 100 UK babies (approximately 7,500 annually) may suffer learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to alcohol exposure in the womb.

Elizabeth Mitchell from the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome describes the condition as ""an enormous problem"" that is ""vastly under-diagnosed."" The article highlights 15-year-old Niamh Brown's case, who requires assistance with daily activities and will never live independently. Other medical issues associated with the syndrome include organ problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy.

Current UK government guidance advises pregnant women to avoid alcohol or limit consumption to two units no more than twice weekly, though Mitchell advocates for complete abstinence during pregnancy."
13-3,"# Scotland Women's Football Team Close to Euro Qualification

Scotland's women's football team has won all five qualifying matches and needs a victory against Iceland at Falkirk Stadium to nearly secure their place in the European Championships. Lisa Evans, a 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward, expressed that missing out would be ""devastating"" after previous play-off losses for Euro 2013 and the World Cup.

Iceland, ranked 20th in the world (one place above Scotland), is also unbeaten with four wins. The upcoming match and return fixture in Reykjavik will likely determine the group winner. With the top six runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland is well-positioned to reach the finals in the Netherlands without needing a play-off.

Evans is among 12 players in the 20-person squad who play outside Scotland. She recently won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich and believes that having more players in top global leagues benefits the national team. She noted that the German league is ""arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness"" and that players abroad bring ""different culture"" and ""new way of playing"" to the national team."

12-0,"# Summary of Omura's Whale Discovery

An Omura's whale, a species once feared extinct, was found washed up on a remote beach in Exmouth, Western Australia, following Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This represents the first sighting in Western Australia and only the second in Australia.

Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the discovery ""highly significant"" as the species was only scientifically described in 2003 and little is known about it. Typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, Omura's whales have distinctive features including a sleek body shape and unique skeletal characteristics. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton later for scientific study and possible museum display."
