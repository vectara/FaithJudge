**The Attack:** Militants detonated explosives at Afghanistan's Sardar Daud hospital gate, then opened fire on staff and patients. Four attackers were killed by commandos after several hours of fighting, with over 50 people wounded.

**Responsibility:** The Islamic State (IS) claimed the attack, while the Taliban denied involvement.

**Strategic Significance:** This represents a tactical shift for IS in Afghanistan - their first direct engagement with security forces in the capital. Previously, they primarily targeted civilian gatherings, especially Shia Muslims.

**Broader Context:** Since establishing their ""Khorasan Province"" in 2015, IS has conducted multiple attacks in Afghanistan, including major bombings in Kabul that killed dozens. The hospital attack suggests IS now has enhanced resources and military training to expand their operations beyond their traditional eastern strongholds near the Pakistan border.

**Government Response:** President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as violating ""all human values,"" while officials vowed to avenge the victims. The government claims to have eliminated some IS bases but acknowledges they still control mountainous areas in the east."

14-2,"**Summary:**

Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, announced he would extend his term by one year beyond the original 2018 end date, rather than serving the full eight years until 2021 as many expected. The decision was primarily driven by personal family considerations - specifically, his daughters' education timeline, with one finishing A-levels and another completing GCSEs in 2018, making it an ideal time to return to Canada's education system.

While Carney acknowledged the professional difficulty of leaving during Brexit negotiations and understood that staying until 2021 might provide market stability, he felt he could only extend one additional year given his family's planned departure in 2018. Prime Minister Theresa May supported his decision despite preferring he stay until 2021. The timing means Carney will oversee the Article 50 process completion, after which a new Governor will guide Britain's post-Brexit economic future. The decision was described as entirely personal, with no political pressures or policy disagreements influencing it."

15-3,"**Core Summary:**

A major University of Washington study found that heavy drinking among Americans increased 17.2% between 2005-2012, with the rise primarily driven by women's changing drinking patterns. By 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers.

**Key Findings:**
- Women's binge drinking rates increased seven times more than men's nationwide
- Heavy drinking defined as >1 drink/day for women, >2 for men; binge drinking as 4+ drinks for women, 5+ for men in a single occasion
- Geographic variation was significant (binge drinking ranged from 6% to 36% across counties)

**Impact:** Alcohol-related deaths totaled 88,600 in 2010, with excessive drinking costing over $220 billion annually.

**Explanations:** Researchers cite changing social norms making women's heavy drinking more acceptable, increased wealth in tech centers, relatively cheaper alcohol prices, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies.

**Methodology:** The study analyzed data from 3.7 million Americans aged 21+ through CDC's ongoing telephone health survey, representing the first county-level tracking of adult drinking patterns."

16-0,"**Summary:**

This passage discusses the historic boxing rivalry between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, part of boxing's ""golden age"" in the classic middling weights. Their first fight saw Duran controversially defeat Leonard by decision amid scoring confusion. In their rematch on November 25, 1980, in New Orleans, Leonard changed tactics from slugging to using his superior speed and movement. After being frustrated and psychologically pressured by Leonard's style, Duran infamously quit in the eighth round, telling the referee ""no mas"" (no more). 

This shocking surrender by one of boxing's most heroic warriors stunned the world. Despite Duran's claims of stomach cramps, his manager stated he quit due to embarrassment. The incident devastated Duran's reputation in Panama, leading to pulled endorsements and public anger. It took three years for Duran to restore his standing by winning the light-middleweight title in 1983. Leonard won their third encounter in 1989 and considered forcing Duran to quit his greatest achievement - ""better than knocking him out.""

The passage frames this as part of a series examining fights that shaped boxing history, opening with mention of the anticipated Mayweather-Pacquiao bout."

Rory McIlroy, the world number one, believes it's ""unthinkable"" that he won't eventually win The Masters to complete the career grand slam.

- Calls that 2011 collapse ""the most important day of his career"" because of the lessons learned
- Bounced back to win the US Open two months later, then added the 2012 US PGA and both the Open and US PGA last year

**Current Perspective:**
McIlroy views completing the grand slam as a ""career-long goal"" and believes Augusta is a course where he can win multiple times. Despite personal challenges last year (calling off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki and a costly legal dispute), he uses the golf course as his ""sanctuary"" from external pressures and distractions."

A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London is being sold for £575,000 - significantly below typical prices for the expensive area - but comes with a major catch: only 3 years remain on the lease. 

**Key Details:**
- **Property:** 1,990 sq/ft maisonette on Egerton Place with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, reception room, and communal amenities
- **Condition:** Unmodernised and requires renovation
- **True Cost:** Works out to £191,000/year or £15,000/month (equivalent to local rental rates)

- Current freeholder is the Welcome Trust

**Market Response:**
Estate agents report unusual interest despite the timing, with calls from locals, developers, and end users. However, property consultants warn that while it ""looks cheap,"" the massive lease extension premium makes it a complex investment that might work best as a short-term rental before returning to the freeholder.

At age 75, Jack Nicklaus hit a hole-in-one on the 130-yard fourth hole during the par-3 contest at Augusta National, marking his first ace at the prestigious course. Playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw, Nicklaus was part of a record-tying day that featured five total hole-in-ones (matching the 2002 record). Colombian golfer Camilo Villegas also achieved two aces that day (4th and 8th holes) but lost the par-3 contest to Kevin Streelman in a playoff. The passage notes Nicklaus' legendary Masters history, including winning his first green jacket in 1963 as the youngest champion and capturing six total Masters titles, making him one of five golfers to complete the career grand slam."

An Omura's whale, a species feared extinct, was discovered washed up on a remote beach in Exmouth, Western Australia, following Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This marks the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. 

The 5.68-meter juvenile female was initially difficult to identify and required DNA profiling for confirmation by wildlife authorities. The discovery is considered highly significant because very little is known about Omura's whales - they were only first described scientifically in 2003 and are typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan.

The species has distinctive features including a sleek body shape and unique skeletal characteristics. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton in a few years for further scientific research and potential museum display. Scientists hope the findings will improve field identification guides and understanding of the whale's regional distribution."
11-4,"Here's a concise summary of the key information:

**Discovery**: An Omura's whale, previously feared extinct, was found washed up on a remote beach in Exmouth, Western Australia, following tropical cyclone Olwyn.

**Significance**: This marks the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. The discovery is considered ""highly significant"" by scientists since very little is known about this rare species.

**Details**: The specimen was a 5.68-meter juvenile female that required DNA profiling for identification. Omura's whales were only first scientifically described in 2003 and are typically found in tropical/subtropical waters around Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan.

**Scientific Value**: The whale has unique characteristics including a sleek body shape, four digits on each pectoral fin, and 53 vertebrae (though the passage contains a conflicting reference to 63 vertebrae). The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton in several years for further research and potential museum display.

**Research Impact**: The discovery will help scientists improve field identification guides and better understand the species' regional distribution."

The black box from a Russian Su-24 jet shot down on November 24 was opened in Moscow, but Russian investigators report missing flight data that could have resolved the key dispute over the aircraft's location when hit. Turkey claims the jet ignored warnings to leave Turkish airspace, while Russia maintains it was shot down within Syrian territory.

The incident has created a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries. The Su-24 was downed by Turkish F-16s, resulting in the pilot's death (killed by ground militants), while the navigator survived. A Russian marine and helicopter were also lost during rescue operations.

Russia has imposed economic sanctions on Turkey, including banning package holidays that could cost Turkey billions, and has demanded an apology. President Putin has accused Turkey of subservience to the US and ""creeping Islamisation."" Analysis of the available black box data is expected to be released next week."

An explosion at a controversial paraxylene (PX) chemical plant in Zhangzhou city, Fujian province, China injured six people and sparked a large fire. The blast occurred Monday night at an oil storage facility following an oil leak. Five people were hurt by broken glass and hospitalized, while over 600 firefighters responded to control the blaze.

The plant produces paraxylene, a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in polyester manufacturing. This facility has a history of incidents, experiencing another explosion in July 2013. The plant itself is controversial - originally planned for the densely populated city of Xiamen, it was relocated to its current remote location in 2007 following public protests over pollution concerns. PX plants have generally sparked demonstrations across China in recent years due to environmental and health worries."

Davina Ayrton (formerly David), now 34, was convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl in a Portsmouth garage in autumn 2004. Despite denying the charge, she will be sentenced on March 4th. The judge remanded her to custody at a male prison in Winchester, citing risks of self-harm and failure to appear for sentencing.

Key details: Ayrton has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer. She changed her name in 2012 and currently lives in a care home in Hampshire. The rape occurred while two others slept in the garage; the victim clearly remembered the attack despite having consumed minimal alcohol. In 2014, Ayrton confessed to the crime while speaking to a care home worker.

The judge described it as an unusual and difficult case, with special protocols established for Ayrton's detention."

Eugene, USA has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships. The International Association of Athletics Federations council bypassed the usual bidding process, citing a ""unique strategic opportunity"" to hold the championships in the USA for the first time. Eugene had previously lost its bid for the 2019 event to Doha, Qatar, but a recent presentation convinced the IAAF of the city's capabilities. 

IAAF President Lamine Diack explained the decision was strategic, capitalizing on alignment between public authorities, private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and public enthusiasm. He noted this departure from standard procedure would help access a key market and support global sport development. The 2007 Osaka championships were also awarded without a bidding process."

L/Bdr Parkinson, who suffered a brain injury in a 2006 Afghanistan bomb attack, carried the Olympic torch on June 26 and subsequently received overwhelming public support. Despite his injury affecting his speech initially, he has recovered to speak unaided and maintains his personality and humor. He walked for nearly 30 minutes with the torch, supported by an assistant, while flanked by hundreds of spectators.

Following his torch-carrying appearance, Parkinson received over 5,000 Facebook friend requests (hitting the platform's limit), thousands of website visits, extensive mail, and hundreds of requests to visit locations with the torch. His mother described the response as ""phenomenal,"" noting that Ben feels ""buoyed up"" and ""elated"" by the support.

Parkinson dedicates 12 hours daily to gym and rehabilitation, walks with crutches, and serves as patron of military charity Pilgrim Bandits, raising funds for various military causes. Facebook suggested he transition to a public page to accommodate the high volume of connection requests. His torch-carrying was part of the 70-day, 8,000-mile Olympic flame journey involving 8,000 carriers leading to the London Olympics opening ceremony on July 27."
13-1,"This passage discusses the TV show Poldark, focusing on the birth of Ross and Demelza Poldark's baby daughter. The main criticism centers on the unrealistic timeline of Demelza's pregnancy, which progresses from announcement to 8 months pregnant to giving birth within just 10 minutes of screen time in tomorrow's episode. This compressed timeline mirrors a previous pregnancy storyline with character Elizabeth. Fans have noticed this pattern and commented on social media about how pregnancies in the show happen unnaturally quickly. The passage also notes that while Ross Poldark (Aidan Turner) initially married his former kitchen maid Demelza out of duty, he clearly now loves her deeply, and that Turner has become popular as a television heartthrob."

New official data reveals 272 children with foetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalized in England last year due to brain damage from prenatal alcohol exposure. However, experts warn the true scale is likely much larger - WHO research suggests approximately 7,500 UK babies annually (1 in 100) may suffer learning, behavioral, and physical problems from alcohol exposure in the womb.

The condition is permanent and severely under-diagnosed. A case example is 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who requires daily assistance and cannot live independently due to foetal alcohol syndrome diagnosed at age 5.

Associated medical complications include liver, kidney, and heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. While current government guidance advises pregnant women to avoid alcohol (or limit to 2 units twice weekly maximum), experts advocate for complete abstinence during pregnancy.

The National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome describes this as ""an enormous problem"" that represents just the ""tip of the iceberg"" of a vastly under-recognized public health issue."

Scotland's women's football team has won all five qualifiers and will host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday in a crucial match that could secure their place at next summer's finals in the Netherlands. Both teams are unbeaten - Scotland with five wins and Iceland (ranked 20th, one place above Scotland) with four wins from four games.

Forward Evans (24, Bayern Munich) is determined not to miss out again after Scotland's previous play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's World Cup. The winner of Friday's match and the return fixture in Reykjavik on September 20 will likely top the group, though Scotland is well-positioned to qualify automatically as one of the best six group runners-up.

The current squad includes 12 players based outside Scotland, including Evans who recently won the women's Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. Evans believes international experience enhances the national team's performance as they aim for their first major tournament finals."

A light general aviation aircraft (Aerostar) made a belly landing without deploying its landing gear at Aero Acres residential airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida. The incident was captured on video, showing the plane touching down normally before skidding along the runway on its belly, with propellers striking the ground and wings bouncing from impact. 

After realizing the mistake, the pilot re-engaged the engines and took off again, despite damaged propellers. The 85-year-old pilot, Chris Georgaklis—an experienced aviator of nearly 50 years—successfully flew the damaged aircraft 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale where he landed safely. He was accompanied by his dog, Buddy.

The video maker noted the distinctive sound of propellers hitting the runway and expressed amazement that the engines continued running despite the impacts. Gear-up landings typically result from human error (forgetting to deploy landing gear) or mechanical failure. The FAA is investigating the incident."

**Current Earthquake:**
A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 35km north of Lucca, Italy at 15:48 local time, with its epicenter in Garfagnana at a depth of 15.5km. The tremor was widely felt across northern Italy, including Milan, Florence, Bologna, and Modena, but caused no immediate injuries or damage. The quake disrupted power and phone services in the Garfagnana area, prompted school evacuations as a precaution, and was followed by several smaller aftershocks.

**Context:**
Italy is earthquake-prone, with this latest tremor occurring in the same region where earthquakes killed over 20 people in May 2012 (the strongest being magnitude-6). The passage also references the devastating 2009 L'Aquila earthquake that killed nearly 300 people, after which six scientists and an official were convicted of manslaughter in 2012 for providing misleading reassurances about earthquake risks that may have caused people to stay indoors rather than seek safety.

An INGV expert described the latest quake as a typical ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"" earthquake for the area that ""came out of nowhere."""

The family's attorney later clarified that while her condition has improved and she has moved out of ICU and opened her eyes, she is beginning a lengthy rehabilitation process with an uncertain prognosis - the quality of her future life will not be known for years. Bobby Brown's optimistic comments were attributed to his ""emotional state"" at the time."
