14-0,"Four militants attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, detonating explosives at the gate before opening fire on staff and patients. The attack lasted several hours before commandos killed all four attackers. More than 50 people were wounded in the assault.

The Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban denied involvement. This marked a tactical shift for IS in Afghanistan - their first direct engagement with security forces in the capital, having previously targeted civilian gatherings.

President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack on the 400-bed hospital, calling it an assault on ""all human values."" Witnesses described attackers in white coats firing on everyone inside, including guards, patients, and doctors.

IS has been active in Afghanistan since establishing its ""Khorasan Province"" in 2015, primarily operating in eastern areas near Pakistan. The group has claimed several major attacks, including bombings that killed 80 people in July 2016 and 22 at the Supreme Court last month. The hospital attack's Taliban-like tactics suggest IS now has expanded resources and military training capabilities."
14-1,"The passage discusses the Booker Prize shortlist, with Neel Mukherjee's ""The Lives of Others"" (about 1960s Calcutta family dynamics) as the 5/2 betting favorite. This is the first year the prize is open to all English-language authors regardless of nationality. 

The six shortlisted authors include three British writers (Howard Jacobson with ""J"", Ali Smith with ""How To Be Both""), two Americans (Joshua Ferris with ""To Rise Again at a Decent Hour"", Karen Joy Fowler with ""We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves""), and one Australian (Richard Flanagan with ""The Narrow Road to the Deep North"").

Karen Joy Fowler's novel is the best-selling with over 55,000 copies sold. The shortlist announcement significantly boosted sales for all nominated books. The winner will be announced at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night, with BBC coverage. This is the prize's 46th year, with a judging panel chaired by AC Grayling. Shortlisted authors receive £2,500 and a special edition of their book."
14-2,"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney announced he would extend his tenure by just one year beyond his original 2018 departure date, surprising many who expected him to either leave as planned or stay until 2021. The decision was primarily driven by personal family considerations - specifically, his daughters would be completing their A-levels and GCSEs in 2018, making it an ideal time for the family to return to Canada. 

Carney, who took office in 2013, faced a changed landscape after the Brexit referendum in June 2016. Leaving in 2018 would mean departing during crucial EU exit negotiations. While Prime Minister Theresa May preferred he stay until 2021, she left the decision to him. Carney's compromise allows him to see through the Article 50 process (expected to complete by 2019) while honoring his family's original plans. He emphasized this was entirely a personal decision, balancing his professional obligations with family circumstances."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, a prominent Sunday Times columnist since 1993, died after being diagnosed with what he called the ""full English"" of cancers. The editor Martin Ivens described him as ""a giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper. Known for dictating his copy due to dyslexia, Gill was both celebrated for his brilliant writing style and notorious for controversial articles, including shooting a baboon in Tanzania and making offensive comments about various groups and places. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, he studied art before becoming a writer in the 1980s. He was married twice - first to Cressida Connolly, then to current Home Secretary Amber Rudd - and had four children. His cancer diagnosis prompted his engagement to Nicola Formby, his partner of 23 years. His final column about coming to terms with his diagnosis was to be published in the Sunday Times."
14-4,"The passage describes cyber warfare activities during the Ukraine-Russia conflict, focusing on three main hacker groups:

**Ukrainian Cyber Troops**: Led by programmer Yevhen Dokukin, this pro-Ukrainian group has hacked Russian interior ministry servers and police email accounts. They discovered data suggesting Russian military servicemen were wounded in Ukraine. The group uses DDoS attacks to disable rebel websites, targets separatist funding accounts, monitors hacked CCTV systems for military movements, and hijacked printers to spread pro-Ukrainian messages.

**Cyber Berkut**: A pro-Russian, anti-Western group named after riot police that opposes Ukraine's government. They hacked Ukrainian government websites during VP Biden's visit, claiming to have retrieved US military assistance documents. The group also hacked electronic billboards to display graphic anti-Ukrainian content, claims to have disrupted Ukraine's electronic voting systems, and published an alleged conversation suggesting Ukrainian forces downed flight MH17.

**Anonymous International** (Shaltay Boltay/Humpty Dumpty): A Russian activist group that publishes leaked Kremlin documents, though it's unclear whether through hacking or insider sources. They've released material about the Ukraine conflict, including a letter suggesting locals don't support separatist forces and emails from former FSB colonel Igor Girkin. Their website is blocked in Russia.

All three groups present themselves as independent activists rather than government-sponsored entities."

15-3,"A major study from the University of Washington found that heavy drinking among Americans increased 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, driven primarily by rising rates among women. The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, was the first to track drinking patterns at the county level.

Key findings include:
- Women's binge drinking rates increased seven times more than men's over the decade
- In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers
- Overall alcohol consumption remained relatively unchanged despite increases in excessive drinking
- Geographic variations were significant, with binge drinking ranging from 6% in Madison County, Idaho to 36% in Menominee, Wisconsin

The CDC defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women or two for men, while binge drinking is four or more drinks for women or five for men on a single occasion monthly.

The study attributes the increases to several factors: changing social norms making it more acceptable for women to drink heavily, an influx of affluent professionals in tech hubs, alcohol becoming cheaper relative to inflation, increased advertising ($3.45 billion in 2011), and weakened alcohol control policies. The public health impact is substantial, with 88,600 deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and annual costs exceeding $220 billion."

16-0,"This passage, part of a series on fights that shaped boxing history, focuses on the Sugar Ray Leonard vs Roberto Duran rivalry, particularly their infamous second fight on November 25, 1980, in New Orleans. After losing a controversial decision to Duran in their first bout, Leonard changed tactics for the rematch, using his superior speed and movement rather than engaging in a slugfest. This frustrated Duran, who shockingly quit in the eighth round, turning his back and saying ""no mas"" (no more). The incident stunned the boxing world, as Duran was known as a fierce warrior. Though Duran claimed stomach cramps, his manager admitted he quit from embarrassment. The defeat damaged Duran's reputation in Panama until he rebuilt it three years later by winning the light-middleweight title. Leonard won their third fight in 1989 and considered making Duran quit as a greater achievement than a knockout. The passage begins by noting that the upcoming Mayweather-Pacquiao fight will be the biggest financially and most significant of this century."

Despite having just one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, McIlroy views his 2011 final-round collapse at Augusta—where he blew a four-shot lead with a closing 80—as the most important day of his career because of the lessons learned. He rebounded from that disappointment by winning the US Open two months later, followed by victories in the 2012 US PGA and both the Open and US PGA last year. McIlroy's recent success came despite personal challenges including calling off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki and a costly legal dispute with his former management company. He views the golf course as his ""sanctuary"" from pressure and is eager to achieve what he considers would be an ""incredible"" accomplishment at Augusta."

16-4,"A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, London, is being marketed for £575,000 - significantly below typical prices for the exclusive area. However, the property has only three years remaining on its lease, making the effective cost £191,000 per year or £15,000 per month, comparable to local rental rates.

The 1,990 sq/ft maisonette on Egerton Place requires modernization but features three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, parking, and communal garden access. If renovated and the lease extended, the property could be worth over £6 million. However, extending the lease for 90 years would likely cost between £3.35-4.5 million through negotiations with the freeholder, believed to be the Welcome Trust.

Estate agents report significant interest in this rare opportunity, noting that properties with such short leases seldom appear on the market in prime London locations. A second similar property is also available for £595,000. Experts warn potential buyers that while the initial price appears attractive, the substantial cost of lease extension makes this a complex investment decision."

Omura's whales are typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, restricted to tropical and subtropical waters. The species has a sleek body shape with unique skeletal features, including multiple vertebrae (the passage mentions both 53 and 67) and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried for future skeleton recovery for scientific study and potential museum display."

10-0,"The passage describes the opening of a Russian Su-24 jet's black box in Moscow, which revealed missing flight data. The jet was shot down by Turkish F-16 fighters on November 24, creating a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Turkey. Turkey claims the jet violated its airspace despite warnings, while Russia maintains it was shot down in Syrian airspace. The incident resulted in the death of the pilot and a Russian marine during rescue attempts, while the navigator survived. This has severely damaged Russia-Turkey relations, with President Putin criticizing Turkey's government and Russia imposing sanctions, including a ban on package holidays. Both countries are involved in Syria but hold opposing positions despite both claiming to oppose ISIS. The black box analysis is expected next week and could help clarify the jet's location during the incident."
10-2,"An explosion at a paraxylene (PX) chemical plant in Zhangzhou city, Fujian province, China, injured six people and caused a major fire. The blast occurred Monday night at an oil storage facility due to an oil leak, with five people hospitalized for injuries from broken glass. Over 600 firefighters responded and brought the fire under control. The plant produces PX, a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in polyester production. This was the plant's second explosion (previously in July 2013). The facility has a controversial history - originally planned for densely populated Xiamen, it was relocated to Zhangzhou in 2007 after public protests over pollution concerns. PX plants have sparked illegal but occasionally violent demonstrations across China in recent years."
10-3,"A 15-year-old girl was raped by David Ayrton (now called Davina) in a Portsmouth garage in autumn 2004, while two others slept nearby. The victim, who had consumed minimal alcohol, clearly recalled the attack and tried to stop it by shouting, but her friends didn't wake up. Ayrton, now 34 with learning difficulties, denied the charge but was convicted. The judge remanded Davina into custody at a male prison in Winchester due to suicide and flight risks, with sentencing set for March 4. Davina had attempted suicide last summer and changed her name in 2012. In 2014, Ayrton disclosed the attack to a care home worker in Fordingbridge, Hampshire."
10-4,"Eugene, USA has been awarded the 2021 IAAF World Championships by the IAAF Council, which bypassed the usual bidding process citing a ""unique strategic opportunity"" to host the event in the USA for the first time. Eugene had previously failed to secure the 2019 championships, which went to Doha, Qatar. IAAF President Lamine Diack justified the decision by highlighting unprecedented cooperation between public authorities, private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and enthusiastic public support. This marks the second time the bidding process has been bypassed, following the 2007 championships awarded to Osaka, Japan."
13-0,"L/Bdr Ben Parkinson, seriously injured in a 2006 bomb attack in Afghanistan, carried the Olympic torch on June 26th in Doncaster. The brain injury initially took his speech, though he now speaks unaided. He walked for nearly half an hour with assistance, flanked by hundreds of supporters.

Since the torch relay, Parkinson has received over 5,000 Facebook friend requests, hitting the platform's limit for personal pages. His mother reports overwhelming support including 19,000 hits on updates and increased mail. Facebook suggested he create a public page rather than a personal profile to accommodate the attention.

Parkinson spends 12 hours daily in gym and rehabilitation, walks with crutches, and dedicates time to raising money for military charities as patron of Pilgrim Bandits. The torch relay involves 8,000 people carrying the flame 8,000 miles over 70 days to London's Olympic opening ceremony on July 27th."
13-1,"The passage discusses an upcoming episode of the TV show Poldark where Demelza Poldark (played by Eleanor Tomlinson) gives birth to a daughter within the first ten minutes. Ross Poldark (played by Aidan Turner), described as a heartthrob, is shown gazing lovingly at his new baby. Though he initially married Demelza, his former kitchen maid, out of duty, he clearly loves her. The passage criticizes the show's unrealistic pregnancy timeline, which jumps from the pregnancy announcement in the previous episode to Demelza being eight months pregnant and then giving birth within minutes in the new episode. This mirrors a previous pregnancy storyline with the character Elizabeth. Fans noticed these compressed timelines and commented on social media about how pregnancies in Poldark seem to last only minutes."
13-2,"Here's a concise summary of the passage:

New figures reveal that 272 children disabled by foetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalized in England over the past 12 months. However, experts warn the actual number affected is likely much higher, with WHO research suggesting at least 1 in 100 UK babies (approximately 7,500 annually) may suffer learning, behavioral, and physical problems from alcohol exposure in the womb. The condition is permanent and under-diagnosed. 

The syndrome can cause severe disabilities, including deformed limbs, problems with liver, kidneys, and heart, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. The passage includes the example of 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who requires help dressing and will never live independently.

Currently, UK government guidance advises pregnant women to limit alcohol consumption to no more than two units twice weekly, though some experts advocate for complete abstinence during pregnancy."
13-3,"The Scotland women's football team has won all five qualifiers and hosts Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday, with victory likely securing their place in next summer's finals in the Netherlands. Forward Evans, 24, expressed determination to avoid another heartbreak after Scotland lost play-offs for Euro 2013 and the previous year's World Cup. 

Iceland, ranked 20th in the world (one place above Scotland), is also unbeaten with four wins. The Friday match and September 20 return fixture in Reykjavik will likely determine the group winner. With the best six of eight group runners-up qualifying automatically, Scotland is well-positioned to avoid another play-off.

Evans, who plays for Bayern Munich, is one of 12 Scottish players based abroad. She recently won the Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern and celebrated with the men's team, including Ribery and Robben. The squad includes BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little, who plays for Seattle Reign.

Evans believes the experience of players competing in top international leagues strengthens the national team as they pursue qualification for their first major tournament finals."
13-4,"A light aircraft made a belly landing at Aero Acres residential airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida, after the pilot failed to deploy the landing gear. The Aerostar plane scraped along the runway with its propellers hitting the tarmac, creating a distinctive sound. Upon realizing the error, the pilot immediately re-engaged the engines and took off again despite the damaged propellers. The 85-year-old pilot, Chris Georgaklis, who has nearly 50 years of flying experience, managed to fly 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale with his dog Buddy and landed safely. The FAA is investigating the incident. Such gear-up landings typically result from either human error (pilot forgetting to lower the gear) or mechanical failure."

12-3,"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 35km north of Lucca, Italy, at a depth of 15.5km. The tremor, centered in Garfagnana at 15:48 local time, was felt across a wide area including Milan, Florence, Bologna, and Modena. While there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, the quake caused power outages, downed phone lines, and school evacuations in the affected area. Several aftershocks followed.

The earthquake highlights Italy's seismic vulnerability. The same region experienced deadly quakes in May that killed over 20 people. Italy is still dealing with the aftermath of the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake that killed nearly 300 people, which led to the 2012 conviction of six scientists and an official for providing falsely reassuring information before that disaster."

Despite her father Bobby Brown's emotional statement that she is ""awake"" and ""watching"" him, sources indicate her neurological state is unchanged. She has moved out of ICU and begun rehabilitation, with doctors suggesting she could live a long life, though the family attorney notes the quality of that life won't be known for years."
