15-3,"A major study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, largely due to rising rates among women.

Women's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36% in Santa Clara County, California, and nationwide, while men's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times. Despite the increases in heavy drinking, the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time. The study suggests that social norms are changing, with women's drinking habits becoming more accepted, and that factors such as changed social norms, increased affluence, and increased advertising of alcohol may contribute to the rise in binge drinking."
