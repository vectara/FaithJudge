* 5-star rating: The food was really good, I was happily surprised. It was raining really hard outside so my only option was to Uber Eat something to my hotel room. The fajitas had a lot of flavor and was a pretty big portion. The rice was cooked very well, the only thing that could've used more flavor was the side of beans. I forgot was to ask for utensils so make sure to ask if you're getting delivery. I ordered a shrimp fajitas with a side order of steak, total was about 38 with the delivery fees. Would order again.
* 1-star rating: Absolutely terrible pickup experience. My husband placed the order and I went to pick it up. When I arrived they said they had no order. Then they said they found the order, handed me a bag and charged me $72. I looked in the bag and found three items that we didn't order. Then She said oh no the order actually wasn't placed. Oh okay, so you were going to give me random food I didn't order? Replaced the order in person and waited 20 min. Horrible experience.
* 5-star rating: It was raining and we were looking for a warm meal. Staff was extremely friendly as we ordered at the counter. My husband and I spilt the chicken fajitas and it was perfect with a side of beans and rice. Tortillas seemed handmade and the salsas were delicious. Hibiscus margarita was fantastic!!"

  - The Mike is very service-oriented, friendly and gave great advice. He made it all very simple, and for me that could be a challenge, the speakers were set up to provide great sound.
  - I celebrated my birthday with 15 friends recently, and rented a private event room in a local restaurant here in Santa Barbara. Mike was there right on time to set up the system and show me how to use it. When we were done for the night, we left the system there for him to pick up. Everything I needed was provided: a couple of mics, a few songbooks, and a signup sheet. The system itself was very easy to use, and I appreciated being able to adjust as needed, from the key of the song to the volume of both the music and the singer. It's nice not to have to shout to be heard over karaoke in a regular bar, and I loved being able to adjust the key even mid-song! The song selection was big and varied, and having the songbook available as a PDF was very helpful: several of us downloaded the PDF onto our phones/tablets, which made it easier to search for songs, both during and before the event. My friends and I had a blast! We loved not having to wait hours till our next turn, and experimenting with songs that we would ordinarily be too shy to try ""in public"". What a terrific service overall, and at such a great price. Can't wait to use this again for our next event!

  - We just used this service for about the fifth time...we use it for all of our parties. Pro Karaoke Systems not only provides you with instant party entertainment, but the owner makes the whole experience SO easy. First he emailed us a PDF version of the song book weeks in advance so we could pick out a few songs ahead of our event. The machine comes with easy to follow personalized instructions and the owner will deliver and walk you through the whole setup as well. And last but not least, every time we've used this service the machine is always up to date with the latest hit songs, which makes the party that much more fun. Highly recommended!"
