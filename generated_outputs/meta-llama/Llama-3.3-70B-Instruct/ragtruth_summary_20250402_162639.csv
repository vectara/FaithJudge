An outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors found that Rolling Stone's article about a gang rape at the University of Virginia was ""deeply flawed"" due to failures in reporting, editing, and fact-checking. The magazine apologized for the damage caused by the story. The question arises whether the University of Virginia, Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, or other fraternities can sue for defamation. According to the law, a plaintiff must prove that a false and defamatory statement was made with the requisite intent, and that it harmed their reputation. However, there are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff, and groups like fraternities generally cannot sue. Phi Kappa Psi may argue that an exception applies, as the defamatory story was imputed directly to individual members, but Rolling Stone's lawyers may counter that the group is too large and fluid. To succeed in a defamation case, the plaintiffs would need to show tangible damages, which could be a challenge."

The author highlights Paul's questionable stance on the Civil Rights Act, his opposition to protections for DREAMers, and his condescending behavior at historically black colleges. The author concludes that Paul's views are outdated and disqualifying for a presidential candidate, and that the American people deserve a leader who will respect and build upon the progress made in civil rights over the last five decades."

The Summit of the Americas in Panama offers US President Barack Obama an opportunity to improve ties with Latin American nations, which have drifted away from the US due to its focus on domestic and Middle Eastern issues. The US has lost influence in the region to countries like China, Russia, and Iran. Obama's meeting with Cuban President Raul Castro is a historic moment, but the US needs to build on this and strengthen its relationships with its neighbors. The US has had past diplomatic disasters at similar summits, and Obama must avoid mistakes and articulate a clear vision for the region, focusing on democracy, human rights, and economic growth. By doing so, he can leave a lasting legacy in the region and show that the US is a true partner in improving the lives of Latin Americans."

A new book, ""Clinton Cash,"" will raise questions about donations from foreign governments and companies, including those with business before the US government. While these issues are potentially serious, they may not resonate with voters who are more concerned with issues like jobs, unemployment, and taxes. The Clinton Foundation has a history of poor management, running deficits and accepting donations from companies and governments seeking to curry favor. However, unless the book reveals new information, these concerns may not significantly impact Clinton's campaign, as voters seem to be prioritizing other issues and Clinton remains a strong contender for the presidency."

11932,"Here is a concise summary of the passage:

The author suggests that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should announce a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to show solidarity with working women in America. This would mean Clinton would take a salary of $308,000 instead of the standard $400,000. The author argues that this symbolic gesture would be a powerful way for Clinton to highlight the issue of equal pay and demonstrate her commitment to addressing it. The idea is proposed as a way for Clinton to connect with ordinary Americans and show that she is a champion for the middle class, despite her own wealth and perceived distance from everyday people."
11945,"Here is a concise summary of the passage:

The treatment of women by modern Jihadi groups, such as ISIS and Boko Haram, is a key part of their radical strategy to build a ""caliphate"" or Sharia-ruled state. These groups use women as spoils of war, subjecting them to forced marriage, sexual slavery, and rape, which is seen as a way to humiliate the enemy and establish control. Women are not just abused and discarded, but are incorporated into the daily life of territories ruled by these groups, where they are subjected to restrictive rules and abuses. The groups justify their treatment of women as being in line with Islamic law, and the brutality is not just sadistic, but a methodical attempt to control women and establish a repressive society."

Prosecutors argue that Tsarnaev intentionally carried out a terrorist act, targeting civilians, while the defense claims that his older brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind and Dzhokhar was simply following him. The trial has featured emotional testimony and graphic evidence, including videos and photos of the bombing and its aftermath. If found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a penalty phase to determine Tsarnaev's sentence."
12008,"The passage discusses the changing views on marriage among millennials. The author spoke with a group of 21-year-old journalism students from Kent State University, who expressed a lack of urgency to get married, prioritizing their careers, travel, and financial stability instead.

The passage also cites statistics on divorce rates and the increasing number of adults who have been married multiple times, as well as a Pew Research report that found 50% of respondents, particularly those between 18 and 29, are okay with society being just as well off without marriage and children. The author also explores the concept of ""sambo"" (living together) in Scandinavia, where marriage is not seen as a necessity, and notes that these countries rank high in quality-of-life surveys. Ultimately, the author questions whether a society without marriage would be just as well off as one with it."
