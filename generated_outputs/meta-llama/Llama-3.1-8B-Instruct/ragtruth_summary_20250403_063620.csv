A Rolling Stone article about a gang rape at the University of Virginia was found to be deeply flawed by a Columbia Journalism School review. The article's publication may lead to defamation lawsuits from the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and its members. However, the university cannot sue due to its public status. The fraternity's ability to sue depends on whether the article's defamatory statements can be considered ""of or concerning"" the group, which is a requirement for a defamation claim. The ""small group"" exception may apply if the defamatory language is easily imputed against individual members. The members of the fraternity would need to show financial harm and establish that the article's statements were false and published with intent or negligence."

The author, a former Kentucky State Senator, criticizes Rand Paul's presidential campaign announcement. Paul's message of inclusion is seen as hypocritical, given his record on voting rights and civil rights legislation.

Emy Afalava, a decorated American veteran born in American Samoa, has been denied the right to vote despite being subject to American law his whole life. The Constitution states that all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens. However, the federal government has denied Afalava citizenship, citing a technicality. This injustice is part of a larger issue affecting American Samoans, who are the last U.S. island territory residents still waiting to become citizens. The passage highlights two Supreme Court cases, Dred Scott and Isabel Gonzalez, which legitimized racial discrimination and denied citizenship to African-Americans and Puerto Ricans, respectively. The author argues that it's time to rectify this historical injustice and grant citizenship to American Samoans."

Pope Francis faced a dilemma when commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, where over 1 million Armenians died at the hands of the Turks. Historians and 20 countries consider the killings a genocide, but Turkish officials disagree. Previous popes had avoided labeling the event as genocide, instead using softer language. Pope Francis quoted a 2001 document by Pope John Paul II, which referred to the killings as ""the first genocide of the 20th century,"" to commemorate the event. This move was seen as a way to maintain continuity with previous papal statements while avoiding direct confrontation with Turkey. Turkey recalled its Vatican ambassador and summoned the Vatican's ambassador for a meeting, with the Turkish Foreign Minister calling the Pope's comments ""unacceptable."""

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old convicted of the Boston Marathon bombing, is facing a sentencing phase where the jury will decide whether he should be sentenced to life or death. The prosecution presented victim impact statements from the families of the victims, including William A. Campbell Sr., whose 29-year-old daughter Krystle was killed in the blast. The victims' families described their loved ones as kind, smart, and beautiful people who were taken away in a senseless act of terror.

The sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found guilty of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombing, is underway. Survivors and family members of those killed in the attack shared their stories in court, often describing gruesome and heartbreaking details. 

Steve Woolfenden, a biomedical researcher, testified about his experience when the bomb went off. He was holding his 3-year-old son Leo's stroller and was severely injured, but managed to check on Leo and comfort him. A good Samaritan helped Woolfenden and Leo to safety.

Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon, testified that the injuries he saw in Boston were similar to those he witnessed in war zones. Heather Abbott, who lost her heel in the blast, testified about her experience and the difficult decision she made to have her leg amputated.

Marc Fucarile, another marathon attendee who was injured in the blast, recounted his experience and described the severe burns and injuries he sustained. He hopes to save his left leg, but it's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee.

The prosecution showed close-up video of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed in the blast, and Dr. King testified about the likely cause of his death. Martin's parents, Bill and Denise, are opposed to Tsarnaev receiving the death penalty.

The defense is expected to try to soften the portrayal of Tsarnaev by calling witnesses to explain his difficult upbringing. The jury must decide whether Tsarnaev will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison."

She worked as a brick maker and later a shoeshine, eventually saving enough to buy a shoeshine kit. Dahou's daughter, Houda, credits her mother with providing a stable home and education, and Dahou's determination to protect her daughter is what drove her to dress as a man. After an interview on Egyptian television, Dahou was offered a kiosk and cash advance by the governor of Luxor province, but only if she agreed to meet with him in male attire. Dahou has since gained praise as a woman, including being crowned one of Egypt's ideal mothers by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi."

The investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 continues. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin stated that no video footage from the plane has been used in the investigation, but he urged anyone with such footage to come forward. Two magazines, Bild and Paris Match, reported that a cell phone video showing the final seconds of the flight was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site, but officials, including a BEA official and a French Gendarmerie spokesman, denied the existence of such a video.

The investigation into the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, revealed that he had battled depression in 2009 and had told his Lufthansa flight training school about it. Lufthansa allowed him to continue training and put him in the cockpit despite knowing about his depression. Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators that he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, who deemed him unfit to work due to psychological issues.

The investigation is looking into whether Lubitz feared losing his pilot's license due to his medical condition, which may have been the motive for the crash. French President Francois Hollande said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week. The recovery of the victims' personal belongings, including cell phones, will start on Wednesday."

Gusky has documented over 1,800 names, with 40% being Australian, 55 being American, and 662 yet to be identified.

15744,"Here's a concise summary of the passage:

The University of Virginia (UVA) is under investigation for its handling of sexual assault cases on campus. Despite a student admitting to sexual assault, the university has never expelled a student for such a violation. The UVA is being investigated by the Virginia attorney general and the U.S. Department of Education due to allegations of mishandling sexual assault cases. 

A Rolling Stone article about a gang rape at a UVA fraternity house was retracted after it was found to contain inaccuracies. However, the article did bring attention to a culture on campus that is not sensitive to victims of sexual assault. Many women came forward to share their experiences, including a euphemism for rape being used by students, and a culture of judging women based on their clothing. 

The university has since admitted to not expelling any students for sexual assault and has implemented a zero-tolerance policy, although the policy's definition is unclear. An investigation by the Columbia Journalism School found that the Rolling Stone writer could have avoided the mistake by making a few more phone calls to friends of the alleged victim. 

Survivors and advocates are concerned that the retraction of the article may set back progress in addressing the issue of sexual assault on campus, and may discourage victims from coming forward."

4. Don't run away after a no, but instead be confident and collaborative.
5. Ask why you were rejected and find solutions to solve that why.
6. Set a number of how many no's you can take.
7. Be invincible by gradually expanding your comfort zone.

The author, a defense attorney, is disturbed by the video of Officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott in the back while he was fleeing. The author believes that if Slager had been wearing a police body camera, the incident might have been prevented. Body cameras can help prevent police shootings and increase accountability, as they can deter officers from misbehaving and provide evidence in investigations. However, the author acknowledges that body cameras are only a temporary solution and that the underlying problem is racial bias within the criminal justice system. The author suggests that addressing this bias will require broad social changes, including tougher hiring standards, more training for officers, and addressing disparities in income, education, and opportunities."

A roundtable discussion on climate change and public health was held at Howard University's College of Medicine, featuring President Barack Obama, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. The discussion focused on the personal impact of climate change on health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. 

Asthma was highlighted as a personal issue for Dr. Murthy, who has cared for patients with the condition. Climate change is expected to worsen asthma and other health problems, with a recent study finding that 7 out of 10 doctors reported climate change contributing to more health problems among their patients.

The World Health Organization estimates that climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050, primarily due to malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure, and under-nutrition. The Environmental Protection Agency notes that the impacts of climate change on health will depend on various factors, including a community's public health and safety systems, individual behavior, and economic status.

President Obama emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for public health, citing the improvement in air quality in Los Angeles as an example of what can be achieved through action. He noted that companies like Google and Microsoft are developing apps to help individuals monitor air quality in real-time, and encouraged families and parents to join with healthcare professionals to pressure elected officials to take action on climate change."

- Migrants travel through established smuggling routes, facing risks such as kidnap, robbery, and being cheated or left stranded.
- The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has tracked migrant flows through North Africa, with Eritreans and Syrians making up half of the migrant traffic to Europe last year.
- The ""push factor"" of instability and upheaval in Africa and the Middle East, combined with the perception that Libya's doors are open, has led to a massive increase in migrants trying to reach Libya.
- West Africans, particularly from Senegal, Mali, Guinea, and Gambia, are also migrating to Libya for economic reasons, often with unrealistic expectations of finding riches in Europe.
- The IOM is seeing a spike in would-be migrants from West Africa, with many being single men in their twenties who have sold their possessions to fund their journey.

Walmart, a major American retailer, has spoken out against a religious freedom law in its home state of Arkansas, citing concerns about discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. This move has been seen as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's opposition to the law has put the company at odds with some in the Republican Party, which it has traditionally supported. The company's stance is part of a broader trend of businesses speaking out in favor of gay equality, with many CEOs and companies across the country opposing similar laws in Indiana and Arkansas. This backlash has put pressure on Republican leaders, including presidential candidates, to walk a fine line between protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination."
11323,"Here's a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

Easter is a significant event in the Christian faith, celebrating the completion of Christ's mission of salvation through the Crucifixion and Resurrection. The holiday has picked up peripheral trappings, such as the Easter bunny and colorful eggs, which have origins in pagan traditions and German customs.

The date of Easter is determined by moon phases, specifically the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. This rule was established by Christian bishops at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. However, the timing of Easter can vary due to the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars used by Western and Eastern Orthodox Christians.

The holiday is connected to Passover, a Jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in Egypt, as Jesus was crucified around the time of Passover. A blood moon, which appeared during Passover and Easter, is not a coincidence, as both holidays are determined by moon phases.

The Easter bunny and eggs have origins in German customs, with the first known mention of the bunny and eggs in writing dating back to 1682. The tradition of coloring eggs can be done using Kool-Aid, as suggested by YouTube science geek Grant Thompson."

Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani informed the Diet (parliament) that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) has never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object (UFO). This response was given in response to a question from former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki, who asked if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats and if research was being done into alien visitors. Inoki, who claims to have seen a UFO, admitted that he didn't know personally if aliens existed. This exchange is not the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet, with a previous defense minister pondering the legal ramifications of a defense against an invasion from outer space in 2007."

The passage discusses the Summit of the Americas in Panama, where US President Barack Obama met with Cuban President Raul Castro, marking a historic moment in normalizing diplomatic ties. However, the passage emphasizes that this meeting should not be the sole focus of the summit. The US has been losing influence in Latin America to China, Russia, and Iran, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance to reverse this trend. The passage highlights past diplomatic disasters, such as the 2012 Cartagena summit, where the US Secret Service agents were caught hiring prostitutes, and the 2009 summit where Hugo Chavez outplayed Obama. The passage also criticizes the Obama administration's handling of Venezuela, which has handed the repressive regime of Nicolas Maduro a stick to beat the US with.

The author shares a personal experience of being groped on a crowded train in Mumbai at the age of 13, which she kept secret for 25 years. She notes that this experience likely contributed to her phobia of trains. The author highlights the prevalence of street harassment in India, citing a study that found 80% of women in Mumbai have been street harassed. She emphasizes that this harassment is not limited to physical contact, but also includes staring, commenting, and other forms of intimidation. The author argues that many people, including women, downplay or ignore these forms of harassment, which can have a significant impact on women's lives. She notes that only a handful of women have reported harassment to official channels, and that speaking out about harassment can be difficult due to cultural and societal barriers. However, the author highlights two recent cases in India where women came forward to report harassment and achieved some level of justice, and argues that women need to find the courage to speak up to create change."

The Nepal Ministry of Tourism has issued 347 permits this year, a slight increase from last year. The local Nepalese committee has recommended that climbers limit the weight of their gear to avoid overloading ladders on the new route. Some companies, like Alpenglow Expeditions, have decided to stop climbing from the Nepal side and instead use the northern route from China, which has become more popular due to concerns about safety. The shift in popularity has raised concerns among Nepali companies that climbers will divert to the Chinese side, which could impact Nepal's tourism industry."

11838,"The passage describes the author's personal experience of witnessing the Miami riots in 1980, following the acquittal of four police officers who beat an unarmed motorcyclist to death. The author reflects on the parallels between the 1980 Miami riots and recent events in Baltimore, Los Angeles, and other cities, where police actions against African-American men have led to widespread protests and violence.

The author notes that the immediate catalysts for the 1960s riots were police actions, and that the same pattern has repeated itself in recent years. However, the author also suggests that riots can be a form of ""purposeful uprising"" against unjust institutions, and that they can galvanize local and national government officials to address the root causes of the unrest.

The author draws on historical examples, including the 1967 Detroit riot and the 1992 Los Angeles riots, to illustrate the ways in which riots have been used as a means of drawing attention to systemic injustices. The author also highlights the importance of nonviolent civil disobedience and legislative channels in advancing the civil rights agenda.

The passage concludes by reflecting on the recent Baltimore riots and the ways in which they have been quashed, but also notes that the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard. The author suggests that the key to preventing future riots is to address the underlying conditions of poverty, racism, and police brutality that lead to them."

The outbreak is linked to the use of the prescription opioid Opana, which is often injected multiple times a day, increasing the risk of needle sharing and infection. The CDC and state health leaders are working together to control the outbreak, which has been ongoing since mid-December, and have implemented measures such as a temporary clinic, education campaigns, and a needle exchange program. The outbreak highlights the growing threat of infectious diseases, particularly in isolated rural areas with sparse health resources, and serves as a warning to remain vigilant against the spread of HIV and other diseases."

The Hillary Clinton presidential campaign is expected to face criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the Clinton family. A new book, ""Clinton Cash,"" by Peter Schweizer, will expose these issues. The Clinton Foundation received donations from countries like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, as well as Canada's foreign affairs department, which promoted the Keystone XL pipeline. The State Department's analysis of the pipeline's environmental impact was minimal, leading to questions about whether the donation influenced the decision. Other banks and companies with business before the U.S. government were also donors to the Clinton Global Initiative. However, the author notes that until a clear exchange of money for favors appears, it's hard to say what's wrong with donating to charity. The Clinton foundations have been criticized for poor management, running deficits, and cutting deals that raise ethical questions. The author suggests that voters will likely judge Hillary Clinton on issues like unemployment, schools, and taxes rather than the efficiency and ethics of her charities."

In 2014, ambush attacks on police officers were the leading cause of felonious deaths of law enforcement officers.

Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe created a project called ""Toy Soldiers"" to challenge the desensitization of images of war through mainstream media. He traveled to Western Sahara, a disputed region in northwestern Africa, where he posed soldiers from the Polisario Front as green plastic figurines in the harsh desert landscape. The project aims to create a visual metaphor that encourages viewers to develop their own emotional, physical, and political response to war and conflict. Thorpe's background in landscape photography allowed him to effectively place the soldiers in historic locations of battles between Morocco and the Polisario Front. The project highlights the lack of coverage of the Western Sahara conflict, which has been ongoing since the 1970s, and aims to raise questions about how images of war will be consumed in the future."

ISIS and Boko Haram, two violent Islamist groups, have a distinct strategy when it comes to treating women. Their goal is not just to kill or abuse women, but to incorporate them into their daily life and subject them to strict controls and abuses. This is part of their plan to build a ""caliphate"" with Sharia-ruled laws, where women are viewed as property of men. The groups use women as a tool to establish social structures and a functioning community, even if it means enslaving and subjugating them. This approach is different from previous generations of jihadis, such as al Qaeda, which viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal. The treatment of women by ISIS and Boko Haram has been documented by human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, and has resulted in widespread abuse, including rape, forced marriage, and sexual slavery."

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 21-year-old accused bomber, faces life in prison or the death penalty for his role in the April 15, 2013, attack that killed three people and injured many others. Prosecutors have presented a compelling case, showing graphic videos and testimony from survivors and victims' family members. They argue that Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, were equally guilty and that Tsarnaev's actions were intentional and terrorist in nature. The defense, led by Judy Clarke, has maintained that Tamerlan was the instigator of the plot and that Dzhokhar was only following his brother. The jury has sent out two questions to be addressed on Wednesday, and the trial will proceed to a penalty phase if Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts."

A journalist shares her conversation with a group of 21-year-old journalism students from Kent State University, who expressed their reluctance to get married due to financial concerns and a desire for independence. They prioritize their careers and personal goals over marriage and children. The passage also cites a Pew Research report, which found that 50% of respondents, including 66% of adults between 18 and 29, believe that society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children.

The article also references a study by the American Enterprise Institute, which suggests that marriage is correlated with economic well-being, but it is unclear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage to economic benefit or the other way around. The passage also mentions that Scandinavians, particularly in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, have a low marriage rate, with many couples choosing to have children out of wedlock.

The author reflects on her own experiences and those of her husband, who got married at 38 after initially being hesitant due to her parents' divorce.

The city was liberated after a fierce battle, with Iraqi forces discovering vehicles laden with explosives and buildings that may be booby-trapped. The liberation of Tikrit is a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had previously failed to retake the city. However, officials are concerned about the behavior of the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen, who may take ""scorched earth"" reprisals against the Sunni population, potentially stoking local anger and jeopardizing the government's ability to hold onto Tikrit. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back the city of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city."

Xanax, a medication used to treat anxiety, has a debated effectiveness. It belongs to the benzodiazepine class, which works by enhancing GABA in the brain, providing a calming effect.

The passage discusses the mental health of airline pilots, specifically the case of Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525. Lubitz had a history of psychiatric issues, including depression, which were not detected during his training and employment with Lufthansa and Germanwings. The author, an airline pilot, notes that pilots often have to compartmentalize personal problems and that stress is a normal part of the job. However, Lubitz's case highlights the importance of detecting and addressing mental health issues in pilots.

The author questions how Lubitz's illness was missed despite several red flags, including:

* His passion for glider flying, which involves teamwork and interaction with others
* His successful completion of a highly competitive selection process to join Lufthansa's flight program
* His participation in a rigorous training program, which included intense supervision and evaluation
* His disclosure of a previous diagnosis of depression to Lufthansa
* His untypical behavior of taking a leave from his training

The author suggests that the combination of stress from the job, the stigma of mental illness, and the lack of adequate medical leave benefits may have contributed to Lubitz's tragic actions. The passage concludes that the accident was likely preventable and that it is the purpose of accident investigation to learn from such tragedies and prevent them from happening again."

Corinthian Colleges Inc. has announced the shutdown of its remaining 28 campuses, which is seen as a positive development in the effort to hold for-profit colleges accountable. These colleges, also known as ""predator colleges,"" have been criticized for offering dubious degrees, saddling students with high amounts of debt, and receiving tens of billions of dollars in federal money each year. The U.S. Department of Education has curtailed Corinthian's access to federal student aid, and hundreds of its graduates have joined a ""debt strike"" to protest their loans. The article argues that the remaining for-profit colleges should be closed, and students who are not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should have their debts forgiven. The article also highlights the questionable track record of for-profit colleges, including high default rates, aggressive recruitment tactics, and high costs compared to public colleges."

Kabul, Afghanistan, has undergone significant changes since the NATO presence. The city has grown in size but shrunk in scope, with many areas once occupied by foreigners now empty. The legacy of America's longest war is evident, with many Afghans struggling to find work due to being blacklisted after being fired from their jobs as English speakers for NATO. These individuals, who once thrived on their language skills, now live in isolation, fearing reprisals and unable to visit their families. The city's infrastructure, including roads and supply chains, has been left behind, with many trucks and machines gathering dust. The once-thriving economy has been replaced by uncertainty, with the Taliban's influence still present. The city's lights, a symbol of the commitment to the future, continue to shine, but their longevity is uncertain as the last American troops prepare to leave by the end of next year."
11885,"A Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years found the following about award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes:

- Southwest Airlines offered the most award tickets (11.9 million) and the highest percentage of award tickets (11.5% of total passenger seats).
- JetBlue offered the lowest percentage of award seats (4.5% of total 19.7 million U.S. seats) and the fewest number of award tickets (892,000 one-way passenger tickets).
- The ranking from highest to lowest award-seat availability is: Southwest, Delta, United, American, and JetBlue.
- Southwest's unique combination of features, including no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations, contributed to its high award-seat availability.
- The study also found that award tickets aren't actually free, as the cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and airlines profit from passengers not using their miles."
