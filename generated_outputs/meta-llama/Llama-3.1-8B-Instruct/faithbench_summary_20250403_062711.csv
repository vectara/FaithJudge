14-0,"Here's a concise summary of the passage:

Militants affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) attacked the Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, detonating explosives at the gate and opening fire on staff and patients. The attack, which began at 09:00 local time, resulted in the deaths of four attackers and over 50 people wounded. The IS group claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban denied involvement. This marks a change in IS's approach, as they have previously targeted civilian gatherings and now used a more conventional method of blowing open gates to allow gunmen to enter. The attack suggests that IS may have gained resources and military training, potentially leading to more such assaults in the coming months."

Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing a one-year extension of his term, rather than staying until 2021 or leaving in 2018 as originally planned. The reason for this decision was personal: his daughters' education schedules, with two finishing their A-levels and GCSEs in 2018, made it an ideal time for his family to return to Canada. This decision was not influenced by government pressure or criticism of the Bank's economic forecasts, but rather by Carney's desire to devote his full attention to the role for as long as possible."
