Militants, later claimed to be from the Islamic State (IS) group, attacked a 400-bed hospital in Afghanistan, killing at least several people and wounding over 50. The attackers, armed with guns and grenades, gained entry after detonating explosives at a gate and opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos killed the four attackers after several hours of fighting. The attack is seen as a change in approach by IS in Afghanistan, as it is the first time they have directly engaged with security forces in the capital. The Taliban has denied involvement. The attack has been widely condemned by Afghan leaders, including President Ashraf Ghani and de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah. The incident suggests that IS may have gained more resources and military training, potentially leading to more such assaults in the future."

A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, largely due to rising rates among women. The study defined heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, and binge drinking as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion. The rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men. In 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. The study attributed the increase in excessive drinking to changing social norms, increased affluence, decreased alcohol prices, and increased alcohol advertising. The consequences of excessive drinking are significant, with an estimated 88,600 U.S. deaths attributed to alcohol in 2010 and a cost of over $220 billion per year."
