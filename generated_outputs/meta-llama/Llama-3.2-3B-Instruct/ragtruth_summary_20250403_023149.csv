A Columbia Journalism School review found that Rolling Stone's article about a gang rape at the University of Virginia was deeply flawed due to institutional failures in reporting, editing, and fact-checking. The magazine's managing editor apologized for the story and its fallout. The question now is whether the fraternity members, Phi Kappa Psi, or other fraternities on campus can sue Rolling Stone for defamation. 

The Virginia Supreme Court's definition of defamation requires a false statement that harms the person's reputation, and the plaintiff must show the defendant knew the statement was false or acted negligently. However, the university cannot sue for defamation as a public entity. Fraternities, being groups, generally cannot sue for defamation unless the statements are about a ""comparatively small group of persons"" and the defamatory part can be easily imputed against all members. Phi Kappa Psi may argue that the ""small group"" exception applies, but Rolling Stone's lawyers may counter that the group is too large and fluid."

The author, a Kentucky State Senator, criticizes Rand Paul's presidential campaign announcement, which she believes is hypocritical given his record on voting rights and civil rights legislation. Paul has a history of questioning landmark laws, including the Civil Rights Act, and has expressed views that are outdated and disqualifying for a presidential candidate. The author argues that Paul's campaign message of ""expanding the Republican Party"" rings hollow, as his policies do not reflect his words. She believes that Paul's views on issues such as voting rights, education, and women's choices are not aligned with the values of the American people, and that he is not a suitable candidate for the presidency."

Emy Afalava, an American Samoan born in a U.S. territory, is fighting for his right to citizenship and the right to vote. The 14th Amendment of the Constitution states that anyone born in the United States is a citizen, but Afalava has been denied this right due to the federal government's insistence that he is not a citizen. This is a result of a long-standing injustice that began with the Dred Scott case, which legitimized slavery and denied rights to free African-Americans. Similar injustices have been perpetuated against Puerto Ricans and other island residents, who have been denied citizenship and the full rights of U.S. citizens. Afalava and other American Samoans are now seeking to right this wrong in a federal lawsuit, and a decision could come soon."

Pope Francis faced a dilemma when commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, in which an estimated 1-1.5 million Armenians died at the hands of the Turks. Historians and 20 countries consider the killings a genocide, but Turkish officials dispute this label. Previous popes, including John Paul II and Benedict XVI, had avoided using the term ""genocide"" to avoid offending Turkey. Pope Francis quoted John Paul's 2001 document, which used the term, but in a roundabout way, to acknowledge the tragedy without directly labeling it a genocide. This move was seen as a way to maintain continuity with his predecessor and avoid angering Turkey, which has become a key ally against ISIS persecution of Christians. However, Turkey responded angrily to the Pope's comments, recalling its Vatican ambassador for consultations and summoning the Vatican's ambassador for a meeting."

Aaron Hernandez, a former NFL player, was convicted of first-degree murder in the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez showed no remorse during the trial, instead displaying arrogance and bravado. Despite his troubled past, including reports of bar fights, marijuana use, and failed drug tests, Hernandez was drafted by the New England Patriots and initially seemed headed for greatness. However, his life unraveled, and he was eventually let go by the team after being charged with murder. The author argues that Hernandez's arrogance in court was not the issue, but rather the evidence against him, which the jury carefully considered and found guilty. Hernandez was sentenced to life without parole, and the author believes that the NFL and Patriots handled the case correctly, not trying to justify or downplay Hernandez's actions."

The author is discussing the 2015 shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager, which was captured on video. The author believes that if Slager had been wearing a police body camera, the outcome might have been different, and Scott would likely still be alive. The author argues that body cameras can help prevent police shootings and reduce tension between law enforcement and minority communities. However, the author also acknowledges that body cameras are only an interim solution, as the underlying problem is a bias against black men in the criminal justice system.

15817,"Here is a concise summary of the passage, covering the core pieces of information described:

Migrants from over 20 countries, including Eritreans, Somalis, Syrians, and West Africans, are attempting to reach Europe via Libya, driven by various motivations such as repression, military service, clan warfare, and economic instability. The majority of migrants (over 80%) in 2014 headed to the Libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation. They face numerous risks, including desert and mountain crossings, kidnapping, robbery, and being cheated or left stranded.

The ""push factor"" is greater than the ""pull"" of Europe, with upheavals and instability across Africa and the Middle East contributing to the massive increase in migrant numbers. Eritreans, in particular, are fleeing authoritarian government, poverty, and indefinite military service. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has tracked migrant flows through North Africa for years.

The journey is often perilous, with migrants facing destitution and violence upon return. The number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in Europe has risen threefold in 2014. The Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime estimates that about half of West African migrants pass through the town of Agadez in northern Niger, while others travel through Morocco, Algeria, and Turkey.

European countries are struggling to tackle the migrant crisis, with some countries increasing security measures along their borders. However, the smugglers' networks appear to be small groups or individuals, and the arrival of the Islamic State in Libya has further complicated passage. The IOM and other organizations are working to provide assistance to migrants and combat human trafficking."
11317,"Here is a concise summary of the passage:

Walmart's opposition to a religious freedom law in Arkansas has sparked a debate on gay rights and discrimination. The company's CEO, Doug McMillon, called for the law to be vetoed, and the governor ultimately agreed to fix the language. This move is seen as a sign of growing support for gay rights in the heartland. Walmart's stance is part of a broader trend of businesses, including Apple and the NCAA, speaking out against similar laws. The company's evolution on these issues is attributed to its diverse consumer base and recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views on gay equality. The backlash against the law has also led to a shift in the Republican Party's stance, with some prominent Republicans, such as former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, urging the party to support ideas that promote gay equality and help the middle class."
11323,"Here is a concise summary of the passage:

The passage explores the history and traditions surrounding Easter, a cornerstone event in the Christian faith. It begins with the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which is celebrated on Good Friday and Easter Sunday, respectively. The passage then delves into the complexities of determining the date of Easter, which is tied to the Jewish holiday of Passover and the timing of moon phases. The date of Easter is determined by a combination of astronomical occurrences, including the vernal equinox and the full moon, and is celebrated by different Christian denominations on different days.

The passage also touches on the origins of Easter traditions, such as the use of eggs and the bunny, which have pagan roots. The bunny is believed to have originated in Germany, where it was associated with the tradition of hiding eggs during Lent. The use of eggs as a symbol of Easter is thought to have originated from the practice of boiling and preserving eggs during Lent, when they were abundant.

The Summit of the Americas in Panama is a crucial opportunity for the US to improve ties with its neighbors in Latin America, which have drifted away due to the US' focus on internal challenges and instability in the Middle East. The US has lost influence in the region to China, Russia, and Iran, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance to reverse this trend. However, the US has a history of diplomatic and PR disasters at hemispheric summits, including the 2009 summit in Cartagena, where Hugo Chavez embarrassed Obama and the US. To succeed, Obama must articulate a clear vision and rally neighbors behind it, while also addressing human rights and democracy concerns in the region. The meeting with Cuban President Raul Castro is a positive step, but the US must also address its relations with Venezuela, where the Obama administration's recent actions have been misinterpreted. If Obama plays his cards right, he can show the people of Latin America that the US is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives and leave a lasting legacy in the region."

The author recounts a traumatic experience of being groped on a crowded train in Mumbai at the age of 13. This incident, along with similar stories of women and girls being harassed in public spaces, highlights the pervasive nature of sexual harassment in India. A study found that 80% of women in Mumbai have been street harassed, and many women choose to limit their hours outside or change their behavior to avoid harassment. The author notes that many people, including women, downplay or overlook forms of harassment, and that victims often face barriers in reporting incidents. However, recent cases in India, such as the resignation of a UN climate change chair and the arrest of a media company founder, demonstrate that speaking out against harassment can lead to change. The author emphasizes the importance of women finding the courage to speak up and acknowledges the need for allies to help clear barriers to reporting incidents."

This year's climbing season on Mount Everest has resumed after a deadly season in 2014, when 16 Nepalis died in an avalanche triggered by a piece of glacial ice. The Nepal climbing season ended early due to the risk of climbing the treacherous Khumbu Icefall, where the avalanche occurred. To reduce risks, the route through the icefall has been changed to a longer, safer path. The Nepal Ministry of Tourism has issued 347 permits this year, a slight increase from last year. However, some companies, such as Alpenglow Expeditions, have decided to stop climbing from the Nepal side due to the increased danger. The northern route from China has seen a significant increase in registrations, with 320 people registered to climb this year, compared to 184 last year. The shift in popularity from Nepal to China has raised concerns among Nepali companies, which rely heavily on tourism dollars to support their guides and families."

The author discusses the growing trend of self-testing and the potential consequences of increased access to lab tests. Mark Cuban and Taylor Swift have encouraged people to get tested, while Arizona has passed legislation allowing individuals to get lab tests without a doctor's order. However, the author argues that this freedom to test can lead to unnecessary medical care, increased anxiety, and unnecessary procedures. The author cites examples of how excessive testing can lead to false alarms, unnecessary treatment, and even increased medical problems. The author concludes that while regulation and education are necessary, outright outlawing individual freedom to test is not the solution, but rather finding a balance between freedom and responsible medical care."

The author recalls attending a peaceful protest in Miami in 1980, where four police officers were acquitted in the beating death of an unarmed motorcyclist, Arthur McDuffie. The author's parents were community leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement, and they raised her to understand the importance of youth involvement in the movement. The author reflects on the 1960s wave of riots, which were often sparked by perceived unjust police action, and how they played a role in advancing the civil rights agenda. She notes that the same issues persist today, with the 2015 Baltimore riots sparked by the death of suspect Freddie Gray in police custody. The author attended a panel discussion on the topic, where she learned that riots can be both destructive and purposeful, and that they often stem from feelings of hopelessness and dehumanization. She also notes that the aftermath of riots can lead to positive change, as seen in the response to the Ferguson protests following the shooting of Michael Brown. The author concludes that the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard, and that the power of nonviolence can be a powerful tool for change."

A severe HIV outbreak has occurred in rural Indiana, specifically in Scott and Jackson counties, with 142 people testing positive for HIV, including 136 confirmed cases and six preliminary positive test results. The outbreak is linked to users of the prescription opioid Opana, which requires injection multiple times a day, leading to needle sharing and increased risk of infection. The area has limited health resources, with only one doctor specializing in infectious diseases. In response, the CDC, state health leaders, and Indiana University have deployed additional resources, including a temporary clinic and door-to-door education efforts.

The upcoming book ""Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich"" by Peter Schweizer is expected to raise questions about conflicts of interest involving the Clinton family and big foreign donors to charities run by the Clintons. The book will likely prompt Team Clinton to put Hillary Clinton on the road, where she can hold informal meetings with ordinary Americans. The Clintons have received donations from countries such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, and some of these donors have business before the US government. However, it is unclear whether these donations directly or indirectly influenced government decisions. The Clinton Global Initiative, a sister group to the Clinton Foundation, has also received donations from banks under investigation or fined by government agencies. While these issues are serious, they may not be enough to sway voters, who are more concerned with issues like unemployment, schools, and taxes. The author suggests that the Clintons' charities have been plagued by poor management and financial issues, and that the book may not reveal anything new or shocking."

Google's Waze app, which provides real-time traffic information and location tracking, poses a significant risk to police officers and deputies. The app's ""traffic cop"" feature allows users to identify the location of law enforcement officers, making them vulnerable to attack. In 2014, ambush attacks on police officers were the leading cause of felonious deaths in the line of duty. The author argues that Google's marketing of Waze, despite the risks, is irresponsible and that the company should work with law enforcement to ensure the safety of both motorists and police officers.

11932,"Here is a concise summary of the passage:

The author discusses Hillary Clinton's announcement on Equal Pay Day, where she proposes taking a 23% pay cut to stand in solidarity with working women in America. The author argues that this move would symbolically highlight the 77-cent-on-the-dollar pay gap between men and women, and would demonstrate Clinton's commitment to addressing the issue. The author also notes that this move would be a populist gesture, aligning with Clinton's campaign launch and rebranding efforts. However, the author questions whether Clinton's wealth and privileged background make her a suitable candidate to represent the interests of ordinary Americans. The author concludes that while the move may be seen as a stunt, it could also serve a noble purpose in highlighting the importance of addressing the gender pay gap."

The article discusses the unique and brutal treatment of women by modern-day Jihadi fighters, such as ISIS and Boko Haram. These groups use women as a key part of their strategy to build a ""caliphate"" and impose Sharia law. Women are often captured, enslaved, and subjected to forced marriage, sexual slavery, and repeated assault. The groups view women as essential to establishing a functioning community, even if they are treated as property. The article highlights the use of rape as a weapon of war, ethnic cleansing, and a means to humiliate the enemy. ISIS and Boko Haram are going to great lengths to justify their treatment of women under Islamic law, and the consequences for women who are captured are dire, with many attempting suicide due to the oppressive and fear-filled lives they are forced to live."

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, is on trial for his role in the Boston Marathon bombing that killed 3 people and injured many more. The bombing occurred on April 15, 2013, and was carried out by Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, who died in a shootout with police days later. The prosecution presented a case that Tsarnaev and his brother were radicalized and planned the attack to ""wake up"" the mujahedeen, or holy warriors, and to punish the US for its policies towards Muslims. The defense argued that Tamerlan was the mastermind and that Dzhokhar was only following his brother's lead. The jury has deliberated for over 7 hours and sent out two questions, which will be addressed when they return to court on Wednesday. If found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a penalty phase, where the jury will weigh aggravating and mitigating factors to determine the sentence."
12008,"Here is a concise summary of the passage:

The author, a millennial, had a conversation with a group of journalism students from Kent State University about marriage. The students, all in their early twenties, expressed a lack of interest in getting married, citing financial concerns, a desire for independence, and a focus on personal success. They also pointed out that many people in their generation have been married multiple times, and that the pressure to get married is not as strong as it was in previous generations. The author notes that this trend is not unique to their generation, as a Pew Research report found that 50% of respondents aged 18-29 were okay with people having priorities other than marriage and children. The author also explores the idea that marriage may not be as essential to happiness as previously thought, citing examples from Scandinavia where many couples choose to live together without getting married. Ultimately, the author leaves the question of whether a society without marriage would be just as well off as one filled with ""I dos"" open to interpretation."

The Iraqi government, led by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, has announced a significant victory, which marks the end of ISIS' nine-month dominion over the city. The liberation of Tikrit is seen as a crucial step towards retaking the city of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, with up to 25,000 Iraqi troops planning to return to Mosul in April or May. The victory comes after a year of fighting, with the Iraqi government and coalition forces using airstrikes and surprise tactics to defeat ISIS.

The situation is exacerbated by the presence of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the eastern part of the country. The United Nations Security Council met to discuss the situation, but a draft resolution calling for a halt to airstrikes was rejected due to missing key elements.

Xanax (alprazolam) is a commonly prescribed medication for anxiety, but its effectiveness has been debated. It works by enhancing the effects of GABA in the brain, providing quick relief for acute anxiety episodes.

The shutdown of Corinthian Colleges Inc.'s 28 remaining campuses is a positive development in holding for-profit colleges accountable. These colleges, which enroll 13% of the nation's college students but account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, have questionable track records and operate aggressively to recruit students. They offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high debt, and receive 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. The author argues that the remaining for-profit colleges should be closed, and students who are not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should have their debts forgiven. The author cites statistics showing that for-profit college graduates often make less than high school dropouts and that the industry's practices are devious and exploitative. The author concludes that it is time to ""lay the smackdown"" on predatory for-profit colleges and ensure that they do not continue to operate."

The city of Kabul, Afghanistan, has undergone significant changes since the end of the US-led NATO war. The city's population has grown five times, and many neighborhoods that were once inhabited by foreigners are now empty. The US Embassy and NATO have declined to comment on the situation. Five men who spoke English were fired from their jobs and blacklisted, leaving them isolated and fearful of reprisals. Many Afghans who worked for NGOs and contractors are struggling to find new employment, and some have been left with expensive vehicles that are no longer in demand. The city's infrastructure, including roads and supply chains, has been severely impacted by the war. Despite the uncertainty, many Afghans are still committed to rebuilding their country, and the city's lights and wedding palaces continue to shine, albeit with a sense of uncertainty and a possible end to the US presence in the country."

A Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips found that Southwest Airlines had the highest award-seat availability, offering 11.9 million award tickets and 11.5% of total passenger seats. Southwest's unique features, such as no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a large route map, contributed to its high award-seat availability. The study also found that Delta Air Lines came in second with 5.6 million U.S. award seats, followed by United Airlines with 5 million and American Airlines with 3.5 million. However, award tickets are not free, and the cost of miles is built into the purchase of miles-earning products. The study also found that passengers who redeemed miles on cheaper routes, such as American Airlines' Los Angeles-San Francisco route, often didn't get the best value for their miles. In contrast, award tickets on more expensive routes, such as Delta's Chicago-Los Angeles route, were more valuable. The study also ranked airlines by customer satisfaction, with Southwest having the highest score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66), and United (63)."

Prosperity gospel pastor Creflo Dollar is defending his campaign to buy a Gulfstream G650 jet, which costs $65 million, by claiming that the devil is trying to discredit him. Dollar stated that he never asked his congregation for donations for the plane and that the criticism is based on a lack of understanding of the ministry's needs. He cited two accidents involving his old plane as reasons for seeking a new one. Dollar's original request for donations was met with criticism on social media and nationwide media reports, but the church's gift page is still open for donations. Dollar claims that the church has over 3 million supporters worldwide who want him to come to their locations, and that the new plane will be used for ministry purposes."
