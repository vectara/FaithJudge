A militant attack occurred at the Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, where four attackers armed with guns and grenades gained entry after one detonated explosives at the gate. The attackers, affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) group, were killed by commandos after a several-hour battle. The attack resulted in over 50 injuries and claimed the lives of four people. The Taliban denied involvement, while the IS group claimed responsibility for the attack. This marks a change in the IS group's approach, as they previously targeted civilian gatherings and have now engaged directly with security forces in the capital. The attack highlights the growing threat of extremist groups in Afghanistan, with the IS group and Taliban both carrying out attacks in the country."

A major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found that heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, largely due to rising rates among women.

The study also found that women's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times the rate among men nationwide. The increases in heavy drinking and binge drinking are driven by changing social norms, with women trying to catch up to men in binge drinking. The study analyzed data from 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older and found that 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers in 2012. The study also noted that excessive drinking costs the US over $220 billion per year and attributed 88,600 US deaths to alcohol in 2010."
