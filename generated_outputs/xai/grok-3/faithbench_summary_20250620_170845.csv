14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Afghanistan, starting with an explosion at the gate followed by gunfire on staff and patients. The assault, which began at 09:00 local time, resulted in over 50 people wounded and was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, though the Taliban denied involvement. Commandos killed all four attackers after several hours of combat. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as a violation of human values. This incident marks a shift in IS tactics in Afghanistan, as it’s the first direct engagement with security forces in the capital, using methods similar to the Taliban. IS, active in Afghanistan since 2015, has previously targeted civilians and has struggled to expand its base beyond the eastern regions near Pakistan. The government has had limited success in dislodging IS from mountainous areas. Both IS and the Taliban have recently intensified attacks in the region."

14-2,"Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, decided to extend his term by one year beyond his original 2018 departure, opting for a 2019 exit instead of staying until 2021. This decision, surprising to many in the City and government, was influenced primarily by personal family considerations rather than political pressure or disillusionment with Brexit's economic impact. Carney's choice coincided with significant family milestones, as two of his daughters will be completing key educational stages in 2018, prompting a planned family return to Canada. Despite professional challenges posed by Brexit negotiations and the desire to provide market stability, Carney emphasized that his decision was personal, unrelated to government policy or economic forecasts. There was no reported tension with Prime Minister Theresa May, who supported a longer extension but left the decision to Carney. By 2019, the Article 50 process for Brexit is expected to be complete, after which a new Governor will take over."

They have provided data to Ukraine's security service and collaborated with volunteer group Inform Napalm to uncover evidence of Russian military involvement in Ukraine. On the opposing side, Cyber Berkut, an anti-Western group, aims to disrupt Ukraine's military plans, accusing Kiev of genocide under U.S. influence.

15-3,"A major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, published in the American Journal of Public Health, reports a 17.2 percent increase in heavy drinking among Americans from 2005 to 2012, with a significant rise among women. Heavy drinking is defined by the CDC as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two for men over the past month, while binge drinking is consuming four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month. The study highlights that women's binge drinking rates increased over seven times faster than men's nationwide, with a notable 36 percent rise in Santa Clara County, Calif., compared to 23 percent for men. In 2012, 8 percent of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers. The study also notes regional variations, with the lowest binge drinking rate in Madison County, Idaho (6 percent) and the highest in Menominee, Wis. (36 percent). Factors contributing to increased drinking include changing social norms, economic affordability of alcohol, increased advertising, and relaxed alcohol control policies. Despite the rise in heavy drinking, the overall percentage of people consuming any alcohol has remained stable. The study links excessive drinking to 88,600 deaths in 2010 and an annual cost of over $220 billion."

Described in scientific journals only since 2003, the Omura's whale is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters of Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. This discovery is significant for whale scientists due to the limited knowledge about the species, and it is expected to improve field identification guides and understanding of its regional distribution. The whale's carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton later for further study and potential museum display. The species is noted for its sleek body and unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin."

The 5.68 m juvenile female was identified through DNA profiling by the Department of Parks and Wildlife, despite initial difficulties. Described in scientific journals only since 2003, the Omura's whale is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters of Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. This discovery is significant for whale scientists due to the limited knowledge about the species, and it is expected to enhance field identification guides and understanding of its regional distribution. The whale's carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton later for further study and potential museum display. The species is noted for its sleek body and unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin."

10-0,"The ""black box"" of the downed Su-24 jet was opened in Moscow, revealing missing flight information that could clarify the jet's location during the incident. The analysis of the data is expected next week. The incident, occurring on November 24, has severely strained Russia-Turkey relations, with Russia imposing sanctions, including a ban on package holidays potentially costing Turkey billions. Turkey claims the jet violated its airspace despite warnings, while Russia asserts it was in Syrian airspace. The downing by Turkish F-16s resulted in the pilot's death by militants and the navigator's rescue, alongside the loss of a Russian marine and a helicopter during the rescue operation. Both nations are deeply involved in Syria, holding opposing views despite a shared opposition to the Islamic State. Russian President Putin has criticized Turkey, accusing it of subservience to the US and ""creeping Islamisation,"" while Russia demands an apology from Turkey."
10-2,"An explosion at a chemical plant producing paraxylene (PX), a carcinogenic chemical used in polyester production, in Zhangzhou city, Fujian province, China, injured six people, five of whom were hurt by broken glass and hospitalized. The blast, caused by an oil leak at an oil storage facility, occurred on Monday night and led to a massive fire, which was controlled by over 600 firefighters by Tuesday morning. No toxic chemical spill was reported. Local residents heard the explosion, felt tremors, and shared images of the fire on Weibo. This plant, previously the site of a 2013 explosion with no casualties or leaks, was relocated from Xiamen to its current remote location due to pollution concerns and public backlash in 2007. PX plants have been controversial in China, sparking protests, sometimes violent, despite demonstrations being illegal."
10-3,"In 2004, a 15-year-old girl was raped by David Ayrton, now known as Davina, in a Portsmouth garage. Ayrton, currently 34, denied the charge but was remanded into custody at a male prison in Winchester, with sentencing scheduled for March 4. Judge Ian Pearson noted the risk of Ayrton not attending court or posing a danger to herself if released on bail. The case, described as unusual and challenging, was heard at Portsmouth Crown Court. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide the previous summer, changed her name in 2012 and discussed her sexuality during the trial, stating no physical changes or medications were undertaken. The victim recalled the incident clearly, despite having consumed minimal alcohol, and noted that her shouts during the attack did not wake others present. Ayrton later confessed to the assault in 2014 to a care home worker in Fordingbridge, Hampshire. Special protocols for her detention have been established."
10-4,"The city of Eugene in the United States has been selected to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships, a decision made by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Council. This choice bypassed the standard bidding process due to a unique strategic opportunity to host the event in the USA for the first time. Although Eugene lost the bid for the 2019 event to Doha, Qatar, a recent presentation convinced the IAAF of Eugene's capability to stage the championships. IAAF President Lamine Diack highlighted the collaboration of public authorities, private sector, National Olympic Committee, NBC, and an enthusiastic public as key to this opportunity. This decision, while a departure from usual procedures, aims to access a key market and support the global development of athletics, similar to the non-bidding award of the 2007 Championships to Osaka, Japan."
13-0,"L/Bdr Parkinson, based in Doncaster, was seriously injured in a 2006 bomb attack in Afghanistan, resulting in a brain injury that initially took his speech. Despite this, he has retained his personality and humor, now speaks unaided, and has shown remarkable determination in his recovery. He spends 12 hours a day in gym and rehab, walks with crutches, and dedicates time to raising money for military charities as a patron of Pilgrim Bandits. On June 26, he carried the Olympic torch for nearly half an hour, supported by an assistant, during its 8,000-mile, 70-day journey to the London Olympic Games opening on July 27. His participation has led to overwhelming public support, with over 5,000 friend requests on Facebook, though the platform limits personal pages to 5,000 friends. His page has seen 19,000 hits on a single update, and he has received numerous messages, mail, and requests to visit places with the torch. His mother, Diane, described the response as ""phenomenal,"" noting Ben's elation. Facebook suggested he switch to a public page or use the subscribe feature to manage the high volume of requests."
13-1,"In the upcoming episode of the show, Demelza Poldark, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, becomes a mother to a new baby daughter, with Ross Poldark, portrayed by Aidan Turner, showing affection towards the child. Despite Ross being a popular heartthrob among viewers, his heart is committed to Demelza, whom he married out of duty but now credits for making him a better man. The timeline of Demelza's pregnancy is notably accelerated in the series, jumping from the announcement to her being eight months pregnant and then giving birth within minutes in the same episode. This rapid progression mirrors a previous pregnancy storyline with another character, Elizabeth, and has been humorously noted by fans on Twitter, who comment on the unusually quick pregnancies in the show's timeline."
13-2,"Summary:
Last year, 272 children in England were hospitalized due to brain damage from foetal alcohol syndrome, as reported by the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Experts suggest the actual number affected by maternal alcohol consumption could be higher. World Health Organization research indicates that at least 1 in 100 babies in the UK, roughly 7,500 annually, may experience learning, behavioral, and physical issues due to alcohol exposure in the womb. Elizabeth Mitchell from the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome highlighted the severity and under-diagnosis of the condition, noting affected children do not recover. A case example is 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who struggles with daily tasks and was diagnosed with the syndrome at age five due to her birth mother's drinking. Additional health issues linked to alcohol during pregnancy include liver, kidney, heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. The UK government advises pregnant women to avoid alcohol, with a maximum of two units twice a week if they do drink, though Mitchell advocates for complete abstinence during pregnancy."
13-3,"The passage focuses on the Scottish women's national football team, who have won all five of their qualifiers and are set to host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium. A victory in this match, and the return fixture in Reykjavik on September 20, could secure their place at the finals in the Netherlands next summer, potentially without needing a play-off, as the best six of eight group runners-up also qualify automatically. Iceland, ranked 20th in the world (one place above Scotland), is also unbeaten with four wins and is the top seed in the group. Scottish forward Lisa Evans, a 24-year-old Bayern Munich player, expresses the team's determination to avoid past disappointments of missing major tournaments like Euro 2013 and the previous World Cup. She highlights the emotional significance of qualifying and the importance of fan support at Falkirk. Evans also discusses her recent Bundesliga win with Bayern Munich and the benefits of playing in top foreign leagues, noting that 12 of the 20 squad members play outside Scotland, which she believes strengthens the national team through diverse experiences and competitive environments."
13-4,"In Fort Pierce, Florida, a light general aviation aircraft, an Aerostar, attempted to land at Aero Acres Residential Airpark without deploying its landing gear, resulting in a belly landing. The incident, captured on video, showed the plane skidding on the runway, with its propellers hitting the ground and sustaining damage. Despite the impact, the pilot, 85-year-old Chris Georgaklis, who has nearly 50 years of flying experience, re-engaged the engines and took off again. Remarkably, he flew 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and landed safely with his dog, Buddy, on board. The video maker noted the unforgettable sound of the propellers striking the runway and was amazed that the engines remained operational. Gear-up landings are often caused by human error or mechanical failure, and the FAA is investigating the incident."

Ahead of the fight, McGregor unveiled a new tiger tattoo on his stomach, adding to his existing gorilla tattoo on his chest, and shared it on Instagram with a menacing caption. McGregor believes he has more motivation to win the title than Aldo has to defend it for the eighth time, claiming Aldo lacks desire for the fight. Their rivalry was evident during a promotional tour in Dublin at the end of March, where McGregor grabbed Aldo's belt in front of 5,000 supporters, highlighting their tense relationship with less than three months until the fight."
12-3,"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 35km north of Lucca, Italy, at a depth of 15.5km, with the epicenter in Garfagnana. The tremor, which occurred at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), was felt in cities including Milan, Florence, Bologna, and Modena. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, though phone lines and power supplies were disrupted in Garfagnana, and schools in the area were evacuated as a precaution. Several lower-magnitude aftershocks followed. Italy, prone to seismic activity, has experienced devastating quakes in the past, including a 2009 earthquake in L'Aquila that killed nearly 300 people and a magnitude-6 quake in the same region last May that killed over 20. The recent quake was described as ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"" by Alessandro Amato of Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV). Additionally, the passage references the 2012 conviction of six scientists and an ex-official for manslaughter related to misleading reassurances before the L'Aquila quake."

Despite no longer being in a medically induced coma, the 22-year-old shows no response to visitors or familiar voices and has a tracheostomy. Cissy Houston expressed sadness over the possibility of Bobbi living in this condition indefinitely and hopes for a miracle. Contrarily, Bobby Brown recently stated that his daughter's condition had improved, claiming she is awake and watching him, though he was described as being in an emotional state during these remarks. An attorney for the Brown family confirmed an improvement in her condition, noting she is out of ICU and in rehabilitation, but emphasized that the quality of her future life remains uncertain and will be determined over years."
