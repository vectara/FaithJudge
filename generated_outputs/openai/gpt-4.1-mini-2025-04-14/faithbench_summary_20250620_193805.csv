14-0,"Militants from the Islamic State (IS) group attacked Kabul's Sardar Daud hospital by detonating explosives at the gate and opening fire on staff and patients, resulting in over 50 wounded. Afghan commandos killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. This marked IS's first direct engagement with security forces in the capital, signaling a shift toward more militarized assaults similar to Taliban tactics. The Taliban denied involvement. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as a violation of human values. IS has operated in Afghanistan since 2015, mainly in the east near Pakistan, targeting civilians and rival groups, but has struggled to expand its base. Recent attacks include a suicide bombing at Kabul's Supreme Court and other deadly assaults. Afghan forces claim to have cleared some IS bases but not mountainous strongholds. The attack raises concerns about increased IS capabilities and potential future assaults in Kabul."

14-2,"Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by deciding to extend his term by only one year beyond his original 2018 end date, rather than staying until 2021 as widely expected after the Brexit referendum. While extending to 2021 could have provided market stability during Brexit negotiations, Carney’s decision was primarily personal: his family wished to return to Canada in 2018 for his daughters' education. He emphasized the choice was personal and unrelated to government policy or political pressure. Although Theresa May wanted him to stay until 2021, she left the decision to him. Carney acknowledged the challenge of leaving during Brexit talks but felt a one-year extension was the best compromise, with a new Governor to take over after the Article 50 process concludes."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, a prominent Sunday Times columnist known for his sharp wit and fearless writing, died suddenly after being diagnosed with multiple cancers, which he described as the ""full English"" of cancers. Diagnosed months earlier and undergoing chemotherapy, Gill remained stoical and grateful.

14-4,"The passage describes cyber warfare activities related to the Ukraine conflict, involving three main hacker groups: the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, Cyber Berkut, and Anonymous International. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Yevhen Dokukin, conduct DDoS attacks, hack Russian servers, monitor rebel-held areas via hijacked CCTV, and disrupt separatist funding. They share hacked data with Ukrainian security services, though officials claim to use only trusted sources. Cyber Berkut, an anti-Western group aligned with Russian rhetoric, targets Ukrainian government websites, leaks sensitive documents, hacks electronic billboards with propaganda, and claims to have interfered with elections and vote counting. They also allege Ukrainian responsibility for downing flight MH17, a claim unverified elsewhere. Anonymous International, known for leaking Kremlin documents, focuses on Russian domestic affairs but also releases information related to Ukraine, including communications from Russian fighters and rebel commanders. Their website is blocked in Russia. Overall, these groups engage in hacking, information leaks, and cyber disruptions to influence the conflict narrative and operations."

15-3,"A study by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that heavy drinking among Americans increased 17.2% from 2005 to 2012, driven mainly by rising rates among women. Heavy drinking is defined as averaging more than one drink per day for women and two for men, while binge drinking involves consuming four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion. Women's binge drinking rates rose significantly, with some counties seeing increases up to 36%. Despite more heavy drinking, the overall percentage of people who drink alcohol remained stable. The study, the first to track drinking patterns at the county level, noted geographic variations in binge and heavy drinking rates. Excessive drinking contributes to about 88,600 U.S. deaths annually and costs over $220 billion per year. Experts attribute the rise to changing social norms, greater acceptance of female drinking, economic factors, cheaper alcohol prices, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. The study analyzed data from 3.7 million adults via the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System."
4-0,"The Giants started short-handed with player-coach Derrick Walser, but Jeff Dimmen tied the game for the Panthers.

16-0,"The passage discusses the significance of the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight, highlighting it as potentially the biggest and most important boxing event financially and culturally this century. It then reflects on one of boxing history's pivotal rivalries—the trilogy between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran during boxing's golden age. Their first fight ended controversially with Duran winning a disputed decision. In the rematch, Leonard used speed and movement to frustrate Duran, who famously quit in the eighth round by saying ""no mas,"" shocking the world and damaging his reputation in Panama. Duran later restored his status by winning a title in 1983. Leonard won their third fight decisively in 1989 but valued most the psychological victory of making Duran quit."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy, world number one golfer, considers winning the Masters at Augusta National essential to completing the career Grand Slam, joining only five others who have won all four major titles. Despite a disappointing final-round collapse in the 2011 Masters, which he calls the most important day of his career, McIlroy learned valuable lessons that helped him secure his first major win at the 2011 US Open and subsequent major victories. At 25, he has only one top-10 Masters finish but is determined to win multiple green jackets. Last year, despite personal challenges including calling off his wedding and a costly legal dispute, McIlroy achieved extraordinary success. He views the golf course as a sanctuary from external pressures and is focused on playing his best at Augusta amid the hype."

16-4,"A three-bedroom, 1,990 sq ft maisonette in Knightsbridge's exclusive Egerton Place is on sale for £575,000, significantly below neighboring property prices, due to having only three years left on its lease and needing renovation. The lease's short duration means the effective cost equates to typical rental rates (£15,000/month). Extending the lease to 90 years could raise the property's value to around £6 million but would cost an estimated £3.35-4.5 million. A second, larger maisonette nearby is priced at £595,000 with similar conditions. The properties, built circa 1893 with historic significance, rarely come to market with such short leases. Agents note strong interest but warn buyers of the high premium and risks involved in lease extension."

The analysis, expected next week, may clarify the jet's location when hit, amid disputes: Turkey claims the jet violated its airspace despite warnings, while Russia insists it was shot down over Syria. The incident escalated tensions, leading Russia to impose sanctions on Turkey, including a package holiday ban. The downing resulted in the pilot's death, a marine's death during rescue, and a destroyed helicopter. Both countries, involved in Syria with opposing stances, remain in conflict over the event."
10-2,"An explosion at a paraxylene (PX) chemical plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, China, injured six people and caused a large fire. The blast, triggered by an oil leak at an oil storage facility, led to five injuries from broken glass; all were hospitalized. Over 600 firefighters controlled the blaze by Tuesday morning. Residents nearby reported hearing the explosion and feeling tremors. The plant, producing a carcinogenic chemical used in polyester manufacturing, had a previous explosion in 2013 without casualties. PX plants have sparked protests in China due to pollution concerns, leading to the Zhangzhou plant's relocation from the densely populated city of Xiamen after backlash in 2007."
10-3,"In 2004, a 15-year-old girl met David Ayrton at a Portsmouth garage, where Ayrton, now 34 and known as Davina, allegedly raped her while two others slept nearby. Ayrton denied the charge and will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded Ayrton into custody, likely at a male prison in Winchester, citing risks if released on bail. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide the previous summer, has protocols in place for her detention. She changed her name in 2012 and stated during the trial that she had not undergone physical or medical changes related to her sexuality. The victim, who had consumed minimal alcohol, clearly recalled the attack and reported it to a care home worker in 2014."
10-4,"Eugene, USA, has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) council bypassed the usual bidding process, citing a unique strategic opportunity to hold the event in the USA for the first time. Eugene had previously lost its 2019 bid to Doha, Qatar, but a recent presentation convinced the IAAF of Eugene's capability to host. IAAF President Lamine Diack emphasized the collaboration between public authorities, the private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and the public as key factors. This decision, though unusual, aims to advance the global development of the sport. The 2007 championships in Osaka were also awarded without bidding."
13-0,"L/Bdr Ben Parkinson, seriously injured in a 2006 Afghanistan bomb attack, carried the Olympic torch on 26 June, walking for nearly half an hour with assistance.

Since carrying the torch, he has received over 5,000 Facebook friend requests—the platform's limit for personal pages—leading to overwhelming public support through messages, website visits, and mail. Facebook suggests public figures like Ben use pages or subscribe features to manage large followings.

13-1,"Demelza Poldark, previously barely showing, is now the proud mother of Ross Poldark’s newborn daughter in the latest episode. Despite marrying Demelza out of duty, Ross expresses genuine affection for her, though the rapid pregnancy timeline—from announcement to birth within minutes—has drawn criticism from fans. This quick progression mirrors a past instance in the show where another character’s pregnancy was similarly fast-tracked between episodes, prompting viewers to comment humorously on the accelerated timelines."
13-2,"Last year, 272 children with disabilities caused by foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were hospitalized in England, though experts warn the true number affected by prenatal alcohol exposure is likely much higher. WHO research estimates that about 1 in 100 UK babies—around 7,500 annually—suffer learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to alcohol exposure in the womb. FAS is a severe, lifelong condition that is under-diagnosed. Affected individuals, like 15-year-old Niamh Brown, often require lifelong support. Associated medical issues include liver, kidney, heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. While government guidelines currently allow limited alcohol consumption during pregnancy, some experts advocate for advising complete abstinence."

Iceland, ranked just above Scotland, remains unbeaten, making their upcoming matches crucial for group leadership.
