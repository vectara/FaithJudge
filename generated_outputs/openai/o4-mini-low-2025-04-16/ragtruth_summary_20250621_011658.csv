15599,"Blue Bell Creameries has shut down its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant after listeria monocytogenes was found in a 3-ounce ice cream cup produced there. The CDC warned consumers and institutions on Friday not to eat any Blue Bell products made at that facility—specifically 3-ounce servings in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T—though other Blue Bell ice cream is not affected. This is the company’s first-ever product recall in its 108-year history, and follows a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital where five people fell ill and three died; at least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream. Genetic tests linked listeria from a hospital-recovered cup and factory samples, and in a separate Texas outbreak, patient isolates from 2010–2014 matched recovered ice cream samples. Investigations are ongoing to determine whether these illnesses are caused by exposure to Blue Bell products. The company recalled other items made at its Texas plant in early March and added 3-ounce cups, but continues to assure customers that half-gallons, pints, quarts, three-gallon tubs and other 3-ounce cups are not included in the recall. Listeriosis is a serious infection that primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and immunocompromised individuals; about 1,600 people in the U.S. become seriously ill each year and roughly 16 percent of cases are fatal."
15601,"An independent review by Columbia Journalism School professors found that Rolling Stone suffered an “institutional failure” in reporting, editing, supervision and fact‐checking its now‐discredited story of a UVA gang rape. The magazine’s managing editor apologized to readers and to those harmed by the article, including members of Phi Kappa Psi and other UVA students and administrators. Under Virginia law (Jordan v. Kollman), libel requires publication of a false, defamatory statement made with the requisite intent, but must be balanced against free‐speech protections; true statements and pure opinion are not actionable. Individual fraternity members, as private persons, would need to prove a false factual statement about them, reputational harm and that Rolling Stone knew or should have known the story was false. UVA itself—a public institution—cannot sue for defamation, and groups generally lack standing unless they are a small, identifiable class whose members can show individualized harm. Phi Kappa Psi could invoke a “small‐group” exception, but Rolling Stone could counter that its membership is too large and fluid; other fraternities would face even greater obstacles. Finally, plaintiffs must also demonstrate actual financial or reputational damage, making successful defamation suits rare."
15604,"A longtime Kentucky legislator—who in 1967 became the State Senate’s first woman and first person of color—criticizes Senator Rand Paul’s 2016 presidential bid as hollowly “inclusive.” She argues that, despite Paul’s claims to broaden GOP outreach, his record shows opposition to landmark civil-rights and voting-rights laws, the Department of Education, women’s reproductive choices, DREAMer protections, and federal anti-discrimination standards for private businesses. She recalls his dismissive remark that “we have an African-American President” as proof he downplays the need for stronger voting-rights safeguards. In her view, Paul’s outdated positions and condescending overtures, especially on minority issues, disqualify him from national leadership, and Americans deserve a candidate committed to building on—not rolling back—half a century of progress."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau, who in 1996—at age 34 and already a married mother of four—began an illegal affair with her 13-year-old student Vili Fualaau, gave birth to his child and served over seven years in prison for their relationship. Released in 2005, the two married soon afterward and now have two teenage daughters; they’ll mark their 10th wedding anniversary on May 20. In an upcoming ABC “20/20” interview with Barbara Walters (airing Friday), Mary Kay, now 53, explains how their marriage endures despite their age gap, outlines her plans to teach again and seek removal of her registered-sex-offender status. Vili, 31, speaks candidly about his struggles with alcoholism, depression and why he believes the system failed him as a minor."
15616,"Kanye West and photographer Daniel Ramos have quietly settled the civil lawsuit Ramos filed after West assaulted him and tried to grab his camera at LAX in July 2013. Last year West pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery in that incident and was given two years’ probation, anger-management classes and community service. Ramos and attorney Gloria Allred had sought general and punitive damages for interference with his lawful work. The trial set for next week was dismissed once the parties reached a settlement that included West’s apology to Ramos—evidenced by a handshake captured in a photo—and, according to Allred, sent the message that celebrities are not above the law. The passage also notes that West avoided criminal charges in a separate January 2014 Beverly Hills altercation by settling civilly. CNN’s Sonya Hamasaki contributed to the report."
15617,"Blues legend B.B. King, 89, was briefly hospitalized for dehydration related to his Type II diabetes but was released the same day and is now resting at home with his grandchildren. King thanked well-wishers in a statement and was described by family publicist Angela Moore as a “trouper” unwilling to let fans down. No details were given on the hospital or location. Known as “Blues Boy” from his Beale Street disc-jockey days, King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and has 30 Grammy nominations. His signature Gibson guitar “Lucille” debuted in the 1980s. Among his hits are “The Thrill Is Gone,” “There Must Be a Better World Somewhere” and “When Love Comes to Town.” Last year he also battled dehydration and exhaustion, canceling the rest of a Chicago tour."
15623,"Chris Copeland, a 31-year-old forward for the Indiana Pacers, was stabbed early Wednesday after leaving New York’s 1OAK nightclub in Chelsea with a companion, Katrine Saltara. Though the knife attack occurred out of view—in front of the nearby Fulton Houses project—a 1OAK statement said staff immediately assisted Copeland and called for help as he and Saltara bled back toward the club. A 22-year-old Brooklyn man was arrested at the scene; charges are pending. Copeland suffered wounds to his left elbow and abdomen and is in stable condition; Saltara and a second woman also incurred non-life-threatening cuts. Shortly afterward, Atlanta Hawks players Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha—who had played a game in Atlanta the night before—rushed outside to check on Copeland, allegedly pushed through police, and were arrested on obstruction and related charges (Sefolosha also faces resisting-arrest). Both Hawks say they will contest the charges. The Pacers and Hawks organizations are reviewing the incident."
15627,"Twenty years after her death, Tejano star Selena is set to return as a “walking, talking, singing and dancing” digital embodiment called “Selena the One.”  Developed by Nevada’s Acrovirt LLC with intimate data on her mannerisms, the project—endorsed by her sister Suzette Quintanilla—is meant to introduce Selena to new fans without “replacing” her legacy.  Scheduled for a 2018 launch, the hologram will release new songs and videos, collaborate with today’s artists and tour.  An Indiegogo campaign starting April 16 seeks $500,000 in funding.  The Fiesta de la Flor tribute in Corpus Christi follows on April 17–18."
15628,"Alaska Airlines Flight 448 departed Seattle-Tacoma for Los Angeles Monday afternoon when the pilot, 14 minutes into the flight, heard pounding from the pressurized, temperature-controlled cargo hold and returned to the airport. The noise came from a Menzies Aviation ramp agent—one of four loading baggage—who had climbed in and fallen asleep. Passengers reported hearing banging and faint screams; a federal air marshal inside the cabin banged back and warned crew as the plane made an emergency landing within seven minutes. Emergency vehicles met the aircraft on the tarmac. The agent was hospitalized as a precaution, passed a drug test, and was discharged; his shift had begun at 5 a.m. and officially ended before departure. Alaska Airlines is investigating; all ramp staff carry security badges and undergo background checks. Flight 448, with 170 passengers and six crew, ultimately reached Los Angeles early that evening."
15634,"Emy Afalava, a decorated U.S. veteran born and raised under American law in American Samoa (a U.S. territory since 1900), has been denied citizenship—and thus the right to vote—despite the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee that “all persons born … in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens.” Afalava and other American Samoans have brought a federal lawsuit in the D.C. Circuit to correct this injustice. Historically, the United States treated birth on its soil as an automatic path to citizenship, a principle only derailed by the 1857 Dred Scott decision, which denied African-Americans citizenship until it was nullified by the Civil War–era Fourteenth Amendment. Yet racial prejudice resurfaced in the early 20th century’s Insular Cases and in the 1904 Supreme Court review of Puerto Rican Isabel Gonzalez’s attempt to enter New York. Although the Court ruled Puerto Ricans were not “aliens,” it refused to recognize them as citizens, reinforcing second-class status for territorial residents. Over the past century, inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have acquired full citizenship rights; today, only American Samoans like Afalava remain excluded."
15638,"Iman (25) and Siham (27) Hashi are sisters who fled Mogadishu in 1991 and grew up as refugees in Canada, where they discovered a passion for music. Now based in Los Angeles, they’re recording their debut Afro-pop album—a pop-and-hip-hop fusion with African percussion—working with producer Elijah Kelley and writing most tracks themselves. Signed to Warner Brothers, they cite influences from Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, the Spice Girls and contemporary artists.  

Beyond music, they serve as spokeswomen for UNHCR, having begun by tweeting about family in Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camp and moving on to benefit concerts in Toronto, San Diego and major events like World Refugee Day at the Kennedy Center. They also launched “Wish Creatively,” a socially conscious jewelry line that channels proceeds to women’s income-generation projects in Kenya and Somalia.  

With most of their album mixed and pending a rollout plan, the sisters aim to redefine the refugee narrative and use their growing platform to inspire others and give back to their homeland."
15651,"Pope Francis confronted a familiar tension this past Sunday in Rome: whether to speak out forcefully or tread lightly as both spiritual leader to nearly a billion Catholics and head of a diplomatic state. Marking the centenary of the Armenian slaughter by Ottoman Turks—widely called the first genocide of the 20th century but disputed by Turkey—he quoted a 2001 document by St. John Paul II that used the term “genocide,” thereby upholding Vatican continuity on this sensitive issue. Previous popes had avoided the word in public remarks to placate Turkey, an important partner against ISIS’s persecution of Christians. Turkey reacted by recalling its Vatican ambassador and condemning Francis’s “unacceptable” reference. The episode illustrates Francis’s blend of mercy and moral bluntness: he has brokered landmark diplomatic initiatives (U.S.–Cuba detente, Israeli–Palestinian prayer service) yet has also urged force against ISIS, warned of societal “Mexicanization,” and defended religious honor. On Monday, he encouraged priests to speak fearlessly and stand by their convictions, just as the early apostles did."
15652,"National Park Week runs April 18–26, with all 407 National Park Service sites—including the 128 that normally charge fees—offering free admission on its weekend (Saturday and Sunday). The event, hosted by the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation, features activities such as night-time astronomy parties, Revolutionary War programs, Earth Day celebrations and Junior Ranger programs. Visitors can find nearby parks at FindYourPark.com, get more ideas at nationalparkweek.org, and share their experiences with #FindYourPark on social media and at FindYourPark.com."
15661,"Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) sent a second remote‐controlled robot into the damaged Fukushima Daiichi reactor (ruined by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami) and captured a mysterious green glow, along with some yellow discoloration on a grating—its causes are unknown. The probe recorded lower‐than‐expected radiation and temperatures, suggesting the plant’s cooling systems are working. Akira Ono, chief of the Fukushima Daiichi plant, called the mission “a great step forward” for gathering data needed in decommissioning. The first robot, deployed April 10, stalled after 10 meters when its path was blocked and was abandoned on April 12 after completing two‐thirds of its planned survey. The second robot, sent in on April 15, successfully gathered radiation and temperature readings at all 11 targeted points. Four years after the disaster, radiation inside the three ruined reactors remains too high for people to enter; full decommissioning is expected to cost about $50 billion and take many years."
15665,"During the sentencing phase of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s trial for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, jurors heard victim-impact testimony describing both the physical devastation and the emotional void left by his attacks. Four people were killed—29-year-old Krystle Campbell; Chinese graduate student Lingzi Lu; 8-year-old Martin Richard; and MIT Officer Sean Collier—and their families spoke of lives cut short and “holes” in their hearts. Prosecutors portrayed Tsarnaev as unrepentant, “viewing the people he killed as the enemy,” and urged the jury to consider whether he should receive the death penalty. Survivors such as high-school senior Gillian Reny recounted bone-shattering injuries and scenes of “blood everywhere,” while restaurant manager Celeste Corcoran described having both legs amputated and living with constant, agonizing phantom pain. Photographs of the victims’ smiles and family gatherings contrasted sharply with an image of Tsarnaev defiantly flipping the camera the day of his arraignment. The jury must now decide if Tsarnaev “should live or die” for the terror he unleashed."
15667,"The 50th Academy of Country Music Awards at Dallas Cowboys Stadium, hosted by Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan, was both record-setting and eventful. Billboard’s top ten highlights included:  
• A powerhouse opening by Eric Church (“Pledge Allegiance to the Hag”) and Keith Urban (“Raise ’Em Up”)  
• A Guinness World Record for the largest live-TV awards-show audience  
• Reba McEntire’s high-energy vocal showcase  
• Taylor Swift singing along in the crowd  
• Garth Brooks’s patriotic “All-American Kid” performance saluting U.S. troops and noting the Oklahoma City bombing anniversary  
• Andrea Swift’s emotional presentation of a special award to her daughter, Taylor  
• Christina Aguilera guesting with Rascal Flatts on “Riot”  
• Miranda Lambert’s medley and awards sweep  
• Little Big Town’s stirring “Girl Crush”  
• Jason Aldean’s strong medley  

Billboard’s five low points were:  
• Tony Romo’s overly long, awkward on-stage gag and pun  
• An overlong three-and-a-half-hour runtime with half-song performances and lengthy ads  
• Rushed Milestone Awards for icons like Reba McEntire, Kenny Chesney and George Strait  
• Steven Tyler’s facial-hair look  
• Twitter backlash questioning Taylor Swift’s country-music credentials after her move to pop  "
15670,"Polish Prince Jan Zylinski has publicly challenged UKIP leader Nigel Farage to a duel in London’s Hyde Park to protest Farage’s anti-immigrant stance—particularly his criticism of Polish and other Eastern European migrants. In a YouTube video, Zylinski brandished his late father’s World War II sword and offered either a traditional armed duel or a televised debate. Farage’s spokesman declined the sword fight, noting Farage has no sword and would rather debate Poland’s “tragedy” of losing young talent. UKIP, campaigning to leave the EU, opposes free movement of labor and proposes cutting Britain’s £9 billion foreign aid budget. Another UKIP figure even tweeted a graphic medieval threat against Zylinski. In a second video, Zylinski listed seven reasons Britons should welcome Poles, praising their wartime service, work ethic and loyalty, and urging an end to anti-Polish hostility."
15673,"Seven people were killed when a Cessna 414 carrying them back from the NCAA Final Four championship crashed about two miles east of Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington late Monday. Among the victims were Illinois State University associate men’s basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch. University officials described the campus community as “reeling” at the loss; ISU President Larry Dietz spoke of shock and profound sadness, and Athletic Director Larry Lyons praised Ward’s coaching talent and Leetch’s administrative leadership. Ward, a former UAB standout who played professionally in China, had been at ISU since 2012 and was promoted to associate head coach in 2014. Leetch joined ISU in 2005, left briefly for Whitworth University, and returned in 2013 to oversee athletics communications, video production and several sports programs."
15683,"During the third day of the Boston Marathon bombing penalty hearings, survivors and witnesses described the blast’s horrific human toll.  Biomedical researcher Steve Woolfenden testified that after pulling his bleeding 3-year-old son Leo from a stroller, he discovered his own leg shattered and nearly severed.  Trauma surgeon Dr. David King—who has treated battlefield victims—said the injuries in Boston resembled those from improvised explosive devices in war.  Heather Abbott recounted losing her heel and electing below-knee amputation after multiple failed attempts to save her foot.  Marathon spectator Marc Fucarile described severe burns, the loss of one leg and the probable future amputation of the other, and the constant pain that requires him to take more than 70 pills daily.  Testimony also covered 8-year-old Martin Richard’s death: King explained that Martin’s small stature placed him directly in the blast’s deadly shrapnel path, causing massive internal injuries and excruciating pain before he bled to death.  The prosecution rested after portraying Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as remorseless; defense attorney Judy Clarke will begin calling witnesses about his upbringing Monday.  The jury must now choose between life imprisonment and the death penalty."
15690,"• Actress Sofia Vergara and her ex-fiancé, businessman Nick Loeb, are in a Los Angeles court dispute over two frozen embryos the couple created via IVF in November 2013.  
• Loeb, suing anonymously as “Joe Doe,” seeks to bar Vergara (“Jane Doe”) from destroying the two female embryos and wants them implanted in a surrogate; he has offered to waive any financial or parental obligations for Vergara.  
• The suit also names the Art Reproductive Center, where the embryos are stored, and notes the couple’s two prior, unsuccessful surrogate implantations.  
• Vergara’s representatives have declined to comment; Loeb’s attorney confirmed the lawsuit.  
• Experts say embryo‐storage agreements usually govern such disputes, but without clear terms courts decide ownership; legal views vary on whether frozen embryos are property or human life.  
• The case highlights emerging bioethical questions over when life begins and who controls embryos.  
• Vergara, star of “Modern Family,” is promoting her new film “Hot Pursuit” and is reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello."
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, a 65-year-old grandmother in Luxor, Egypt, has spent 43 years dressing in a traditional male jalabiya so she could work and support her daughter after her husband’s death left her widowed and pregnant at 21. With no help from her family and unable to earn money as a woman in Egypt’s conservative, male-dominated south, she first made bricks for a few cents and then bought a shoeshine kit. Her weathered face and deep, raspy voice have kept her disguise intact, and her daughter, Houda, credits her mother’s sacrifices for giving her an education and a home. After Dahou’s story aired on CBC television, the Luxor governor offered her a kiosk and cash advance—on the condition she meet him in her male attire, which she refused to remove, saying only God can judge her choice. Recently honored by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as one of Egypt’s “ideal mothers,” Dahou insists that donning male dress was the only way she could protect and provide for her child."
15695,"A Massachusetts jury spent over 35 hours across seven days, heard more than 130 witnesses and reviewed over 400 pieces of evidence before convicting former NFL player Aaron Hernandez of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting of his friend Odin Lloyd. Foreperson Lesa Strachan and other jurors were moved by the brutality of six gunshots fired at Lloyd and by evidence showing Hernandez and companions sunbathing and drinking smoothies hours after the killing—even leaving his 8-month-old daughter with them. Several jurors, including Rosalie Oliver (who had never heard of Hernandez before the trial) and Patriots fan Kelly Dorsey, said his fame and wealth did not affect their verdict; they focused solely on the evidence and described Hernandez’s indifference as decisive. Co-defendants Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace have pleaded not guilty and face separate trials. The jury described the experience as far more solemn and emotionally taxing than any TV courtroom drama."
15696,"SkyWest Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 en route from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency descent and landing in Buffalo after a flight attendant announced a pressurization problem. Passengers, including Larry Johnson and his family, reported dizziness, lightheadedness and difficulty breathing; three briefly lost consciousness and 15 were examined by medical teams on the ground but none were hospitalized. A nurse on board administered oxygen to at least two passengers. Although the FAA initially cited pressurization issues and the NTSB is gathering information, SkyWest maintenance later found no pressurization fault and continues to investigate. The plane dropped 28,000 feet in three minutes—a descent likened to a roller coaster—before safely touching down."
15700,"The passage opens by noting that courts often expect defendants to show remorse or plead self-defense, yet Aaron Hernandez did none of that—he entered court with swagger, winked at his fiancée, offered no alibi, and showed no shame. Nevertheless, jurors focused on the “mountain of circumstantial evidence” and found the former Patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, plus illegal firearms and ammunition charges. Hernandez, sentenced to life without parole, once seemed destined for greatness: after his father’s 2006 death, he starred at the University of Florida, winning the John Mackey Award and helping win the 2009 BCS championship. But off-field troubles—bar fights, drug issues, a nightclub shooting inquiry—marred his reputation. Drafted in 2010 despite being labeled “troubled,” he was immediately cut by New England when charged. The NFL’s swift response is praised, highlighting that no vetting can predict who will turn to murder. As he exited court, Hernandez reportedly said, “I don’t need any luck anymore… it is what it is.”"
15702,"A 37-year-old amateur sailor, Louis Jordan, was rescued after drifting 66 days in the Atlantic aboard his 35-foot Pearson sailboat. He left South Carolina to fish, but a storm soon capsized his boat and broke its mast—and one of his shoulders—forcing him to rig a makeshift mast that made little progress against currents. His vessel capsized two more times; storms and salt spray hampered rainwater collection until he finally filled a 25-gallon tank. Unable to catch fish by conventional means, he lured them into his laundry rinse and scooped them up.  
Hundreds of miles offshore, the container ship Houston Express’s crew spotted his listing yacht and rescued him. Despite dehydration and hunger, Jordan appeared in surprisingly good physical and mental condition—he knew the date and was neither severely sunburned nor emaciated. He was flown by helicopter to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, where doctors found no reason to doubt his account.  
His father and marina neighbors—who had held a candlelight vigil when he vanished—were astonished by his resilience. Jordan, an unemployed truck driver who lived aboard the boat, remains in recovery but is expected back at the marina soon."
15708,"• Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said no onboard video has been used in the Germanwings 9525 crash probe and urged anyone holding such footage to hand it over.  
• German daily Bild and French Paris Match claim to have viewed a cellphone video from the wreckage depicting the plane’s final seconds—cries in multiple languages and metallic bangs as someone tried to breach the cockpit—but neither outlet published the clip.  
• France’s BEA accident-investigation agency and Gendarmerie spokesman Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini said they are unaware of any such video; phones recovered at the site have yet to be sent to the Rosny sous-Bois forensic institute for analysis, and no leaks from search staff occurred.  
• Bild’s online editor Julian Reichelt stands by the video’s authenticity, noting authorities only disclosed phone recoveries after the story broke.  
• Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had a documented episode of severe depression in 2009, shared with his Lufthansa flight school, yet was cleared to fly and held all required licenses.  
• Prosecutors and Lufthansa say he had valid medical certificates; Düsseldorf officials revealed past suicidal tendencies but no signs of aggression before the crash.  
• Investigators are examining whether Lubitz deliberately downed the plane out of fear of losing his license. Meanwhile, recovery teams continue human-remains retrieval, aim to complete DNA identification by week’s end, and will collect victims’ personal effects—including additional cell phones."
15714,"A nuclear submarine undergoing repairs in a dry dock at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire when rubber insulation between its light and pressure hull ignited—reportedly during welding work. According to Tass and shipyard spokesman Yevgeny Gladyshev, the sub has been under repair since November 2013, its nuclear fuel was unloaded prior to the blaze, and it carries no ammunition, armaments or other hazardous materials. All personnel evacuated safely, no injuries were reported, and the fire poses no threat to people or the facility."
15733,"HBO’s new documentary, “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,” adapted from Lawrence Wright’s critical book, has drawn widespread attention—but longtime Scientologist John Travolta says he hasn’t watched it and isn’t interested. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times, Travolta praised his 40-year positive experience with Scientology, attributed his resilience after son Jett’s 2009 death to the church, and dismissed the film as driven by “disgruntled” former members. He doubts its claims and expects fellow Scientologist Tom Cruise would feel similarly. Travolta is in Clearwater, Florida, for the premiere of his new movie, “The Forger,” alongside his wife and fellow church member Kelly Preston."
15735,"A Lamborghini in the Exotic Driving Experience at Walt Disney World Speedway crashed into a guardrail on Sunday. Passenger 36-year-old Gary Terry of Davenport, Florida, died at the scene; driver 24-year-old Tavon Watson of Kissimmee, Florida, lost control of the car and sustained minor injuries. Petty Holdings, which runs the Exotic Driving Experience and the Richard Petty Driving Experience, issued a statement extending its deepest sympathies. CNN’s Vivan Kuo and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to the report."
15739,"Gastrointestinal illness has struck 100 people aboard the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity—95 of its 2,117 passengers and 5 of its 964 crew. The CDC, which hasn’t yet identified the cause, will send two staffers to meet the ship in San Diego on Monday. The Infinity sailed from San Diego on March 29 and last stopped in Puerto Vallarta on April 10. Celebrity Cruises has ramped up cleaning and disinfection, kept passengers informed and collected specimens for CDC testing. This is the ship’s third such outbreak (previous ones in 2006 and 2013); the vessel was built in 2001 and refurbished in 2011."
15740,"Nearly 100‐year‐old graffiti scratched into the walls of an underground chalk quarry near Naours, France, has turned up the names of World War I soldiers—Australians, Britons and Americans—who sought refuge there during battles such as the Somme. Photographer and ER doctor Jeff Gusky, who has documented the site for National Geographic in a portfolio titled “The Hidden World of WWI,” calls the century-old inscriptions “breathtaking” and a “treasure trove.” The underground city itself dates to centuries before WWI, was sealed in the 18th century, rediscovered in the late 19th, and then used by troops during the war. Privately owned until 2013, it is a dark, maze-like network of carved rooms and tunnels—so extensive that soldiers even scratched maps into the stone. Gusky has recorded 1,821 names so far—about 40 percent Australian, most of the rest British, 55 American and 662 still unidentified—and sees the graffiti as poignant proof of lives interrupted by battle, noting that some men, like “HJ Leach, merely a private,” were killed within weeks of leaving their mark."
15744,"Rolling Stone’s discredited story about “Jackie’s” alleged 2012 gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity—and the reporter’s failure to contact key witnesses—detracted from a larger, undisputed problem: UVA has never expelled a student for sexual assault, even when the perpetrator admitted guilt.  In response, Virginia’s attorney general hired the firm O’Melveny & Myers to audit the university’s handling of assault claims, and the Department of Education opened a Title IX investigation after a lawsuit alleged campus medical staff lost or destroyed evidence.  Although UVA quietly instituted an undefined “zero-tolerance” policy and the article spurred a national dialogue on campus rape culture—euphemisms like “bad experience,” rapey fraternities, drugging and a sense that reporting is pointless—survivors fear the retraction will discourage victims from coming forward.  Journals like Columbia’s critique conclude that, despite factual flaws in Jackie’s narrative, Rolling Stone did bring overdue attention to UVA’s systemic failures."
15747,"Chinese‐born, American‐based Jia Jiang quit his comfortable six‐figure tech job at age 30, just weeks before his first child was born, to launch a blog project called “100 Days of Rejection.” Determined to overcome his fear of rejection after his start-up failed to win investment, he spent 100 days asking strangers for outrageous favors—such as an unexplained $100 or a five-linked Olympic‐style donut at Krispy Kreme—documenting each response. A video of the donut request went viral on Reddit, leading to media appearances, speaking engagements and job offers. This week he releases Rejection Proof, part self-help guide and part memoir, aimed at demystifying rejection and turning it into opportunity. Along the way he’s accumulated more than 7 million YouTube views and distilled eight tips for making rejection work for you:

1. Recognize that fear of rejection hurts more than the rejection itself.  
2. Treat rejection as a numbers game—more asks increase your chances of yes.  
3. Don’t equate rejection with merit; it often reflects more on the rejector.  
4. Stay engaged and confident instead of fleeing after a no.  
5. Ask why you were rejected and use that feedback to pivot.  
6. Decide in advance how many “no”s you can handle.  
7. Grow your “rejection muscle” gradually until nothing fazes you.  
8. Stand tall and remember that rejection is just someone’s opinion."
15753,"Over the past year’s outbreak—the largest Ebola epidemic ever—more than 25,000 people were infected and over 10,000 died. Survivors face lasting physical and social changes, and the crisis exposed serious weaknesses in global and national public-health systems. Although worst-case projections of a million cases by January never materialized and case counts have fallen dramatically, the virus remains active: the WHO reported 30 new confirmed cases in the week of April 5 (the lowest weekly total since May 2014), but dozens still emerge each week. In Liberia and Sierra Leone, treatment centers now outnumber patients and are being decommissioned, while in Guinea gaps in surveillance—evidenced by post-mortem diagnoses and unsafe burials—suggest hidden chains of transmission could spark new infections."
15759,"The author describes watching a bystander’s video of Officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott eight times in the back as he fled, handcuffing him and apparently planting evidence while Scott lay dying. Absent that footage, the incident would likely have remained hidden, underscoring both the limits of self-defense claims by police and the power of video to secure accountability. The author argues that body-worn cameras—though costly in equipment and data storage—would deter misconduct, reduce use-of-force incidents, rebuild public trust, and likely have saved Scott’s life. While acknowledging that deeper anti-Black bias in policing and broader social inequities demand long-term reform through better hiring, training, and socioeconomic change, the author concludes that body cameras are a necessary interim measure to “shine a bright spotlight” on deadly bias."
15778,"Since last summer’s ISIS assault on Sinjar, some 4,000 Yazidi families have been living in the sprawling Shariya camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, about 18 miles from active front lines. Many fled with little beyond the clothes on their backs; children play with stones amid rows of white tents. Those left behind endured abduction, forced conversion or execution, and women—some as young as eight—were sold as sex slaves.  
Mahmoud’s wife Ahlam, their three children and elderly parents were seized, moved from Tal Afar to Mosul, forced into slave labor and held under brutal guard. After eight months of captivity—witnessing torture and death—they escaped at night into Kurdistan and were joyfully reunited, though Ahlam’s parents remain captive.  
Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil, part of Iraq’s delegation to the U.N., is calling for greater international support and airstrikes to defeat ISIS and secure the release of the remaining Yazidi captives."
15779,"Debra Lobo, a 55-year-old American and vice principal at Karachi’s Jinnah Medical and Dental College, was shot in the right cheek and left arm Thursday by two gunmen on a motorcycle as she drove to pick up her daughters. Police found Urdu pamphlets in her car reading “America should be burnt.” Unconscious but expected to survive, Lobo is being treated at Aga Khan Hospital. A U.S. Embassy spokesperson said the consulate is working with Pakistani authorities, who are investigating. Lobo, a California native, has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Christian Pakistani librarian."
15786,"A Delaware family fell ill in mid-March while renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort on St. John. On March 20 the U.S. Virgin Islands’ paramedics found patriarch Steve Esmond unconscious and his wife Theresa Devine and their sons, ages 14 and 16, experiencing seizures. Airlifted to U.S. hospitals, the teens remain in critical condition and comatose, and Esmond is conscious but paralyzed; Devine was released and is now in occupational therapy. Preliminary EPA tests detected methyl bromide—a restricted, indoor-banned pesticide—in their unit. The agency is sampling air and surfaces, probing a March 18 fumigation at the villa below theirs and any regulatory violations. Sea Glass Vacations, which contracts Terminix for pest control, said it did not treat the family’s unit. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation, and Terminix says it is cooperating fully."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) has adopted an official policy banning its members from participating in executions, calling such involvement “fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers.” This decision reinforces the APhA’s earlier stances against labeling lethal‐injection chemicals as “drugs” and against laws that mandate or bar pharmacist involvement in executions. The move follows heightened scrutiny after a 2014 botched Oklahoma execution and a delayed Georgia execution over cloudy drugs. While lethal injection remains the most common method in 32 death‐penalty states, Utah recently reinstated firing squads. Shortages of pentobarbital—after its manufacturer stopped sales—have led states to use compounded alternatives. APhA’s policy aligns with positions from the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association and American Board of Anesthesiology."
15791,"The passage describes a shift in the climate-change conversation from abstract debates over emissions and industry to a focus on personal and public health. Key points include:

• At a Howard University roundtable, President Obama joined Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to link climate change with health, part of National Public Health Week.  
• Obama recalled the smog in 1979 Los Angeles and how the Clean Air Act led to major air-quality improvements and health benefits.  
• Murthy shared that asthma—intimately affected by air quality—became personal after his uncle died from a severe attack.  
• Brian Deese cited an American Thoracic Society study finding 70% of doctors report climate change worsening patient health.  
• Tech firms like Google and Microsoft plan to use new EPA data to create real-time community air-quality apps for families.  
• According to the EPA, health impacts will vary by regional exposure, population sensitivity, socioeconomic factors and public-health readiness, and include more floods, droughts, heat waves and disease.  
• WHO projects 250,000 additional annual deaths from 2030–2050 (malaria, diarrhea, heat, under-nutrition) and notes that in 2012 pollution caused 7 million deaths. Children, the elderly and developing countries are most vulnerable.  
• Despite scientific warnings, only 55% of Americans currently believe global warming effects are underway (Gallup). A TIME article argues that framing global warming as a health issue—and using medical professionals as messengers—elicits stronger public engagement.  
• Obama concluded that, as shown by past clean-air successes, bold action and innovation can protect health and deliver economic gains."
15800,"Cyclist Wang Pingan, after 460 days and 29,200 km riding through every major Chinese province, had his trusty mountain bike stolen in Shenzhen just days before completing his journey. He’d locked it near the Huaqiangbei electronics markets, but thieves struck within ten minutes. Although police initially doubted they’d recover it, Shenzhen officers used surveillance footage to trace the bike—apparently sold twice—and arrested a suspect, sending Wang a photo to confirm its identity. A recent university graduate who made the trip on just over $100, Wang had refused offers of a replacement, calling the bike his “old lover” and posting an emotional tribute online. With his companion restored, he’s now back on the road toward his final destination, Hainan Island. CNN’s Shen Lu, Maggie Hiufu Wong and Barry Neild contributed to this story."
15817,"Thousands of migrants from more than 20 countries—including Eritrea, Somalia, Syria and several West African states—now converge on Libya as the easiest gateway to Europe. Fleeing repression, indefinite military service, armed conflict, poverty or collapsed refugee routes, they pay smugglers $200–$5,000 to guide them across deserts and mountains toward the Mediterranean. In 2014, over 80 percent of Europe-bound migrants embarked from Libya’s coast. Eritreans and Syrians made up half the flow; Somalis rank third. Increasingly, young West African men—many selling livestock or possessions—risk the Sahara via hubs such as Agadez in Niger (2,000–7,000 departures monthly), Khartoum in Sudan or Tamanrasset in Algeria. Along the way they face kidnapping, robbery, starvation and unseaworthy boats with no navigational support. Trafficking of African women for prostitution has tripled in 2014. Smugglers operate in towns like Sabha and Qatrun, exploiting Libya’s lawlessness. As North African and European states tighten borders, migrants are forced onto ever more dangerous routes, often arriving with grim warnings to those left behind that the journey is almost certain death."
11317,"Major retailers and other businesses have mobilized against state “religious freedom” bills in Indiana and Arkansas—laws widely seen as permitting discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. Walmart, in particular, used its clout in its home state of Arkansas to urge Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the measure; shortly after its CEO spoke out, Hutchinson said he would insist on revisions. The stance follows Walmart’s recent moves to raise pay for 500,000 workers, add gender-identity protections and extend health-benefits to same-sex partners, positioning the company as a bellwether of shifting public attitudes. Prominent Republicans—from former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty to likely candidates like Jeb Bush—have suggested the GOP must embrace middle-class policies (including a higher minimum wage) and bar anti-gay discrimination, though others such as Sen. Ted Cruz have defended the laws. Across the country, CEOs and organizations like NASCAR threatened to withdraw investment or events from states that pass such measures, underscoring the business community’s broad consensus that equality is good for business and discrimination is not."
11323,"Easter commemorates Christ’s atoning death on Good Friday and his triumph over death in the Resurrection on Sunday. Over centuries it has acquired folk customs—most notably the Easter bunny and colored eggs—yet, unlike Christmas, its date shifts each spring.  
  
• Holy Week begins on Palm Sunday (Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem) and culminates in Easter Sunday Mass—this year celebrated by Pope Francis at St. Peter’s Square, including his Urbi et Orbi address and a foot-washing ritual.  
• In Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Catholics and Armenian Christians marked the Resurrection together; Eastern Orthodox Christians observe Easter a week later, following the Julian calendar.  
• Easter’s date was fixed at the 325 Council of Nicaea as “the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox.” Because Western churches now use the Gregorian calendar and Orthodox churches remain on the Julian, their Easters usually differ. A 1997 World Council of Churches proposal for a single astronomical rule failed to gain support.  
• Easter’s link to Passover (also set by full moons) explains why events like a “blood moon” often coincide with both holidays.  
• The egg-and-bunny tradition dates to at least 1682 in Germany—possibly arising from surplus eggs after Lent—and was brought to North America by German immigrants in the 1700s.  
• A modern egg-dye tip: dissolve a packet of Kool-Aid in hot water to color eggs brightly (but beware of stains)."
11332,"Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet that Japan’s Air Self-Defense Force has never encountered an extraterrestrial UFO. He explained that when an unidentified object enters Japanese airspace, jets may be scrambled to make a visual inspection—but these have always turned out to be birds or other mundane objects, never visitors “from anywhere other than Earth.”

The question was posed by Upper House member Antonio Inoki, a former pro-wrestler and WWE star who founded New Japan Pro Wrestling and entered politics in 2013. Inoki—known for his 1976 bout with Muhammad Ali, TV appearances, product endorsements, a 1990 mission to free hostages in Iraq, and recent efforts at “basketball diplomacy” in North Korea—asked whether Japan researches alien visitors or scrambles jets to meet extraterrestrial threats. He says he once saw a UFO himself but isn’t sure if aliens exist.

This exchange follows a 2007 query by then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who speculated about the pacifist constitution’s stance on defending Japan against a hypothetical alien invasion."
11349,"Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old Indiana woman diagnosed in 2013 with an inoperable brain tumor (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma), died early Friday after a widely publicized battle with cancer. Mount St. Joseph University successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up its season opener so Hill could fulfill her dream of playing college basketball; in that game she scored the first two and final layup, cheering a sellout crowd wearing “Never Give Up” shirts. Over the past year she helped raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with The Cure Starts Now and became a “worldwide inspiration” for her tenacity and positive message. At a campus memorial, coach Dan Benjamin, university president Tony Artez and high school principal Bill Snyder celebrated her unselfish spirit and legacy, while tributes from LeBron James, NCAA president Mark Emmert and thousands on social media lauded her courage, leadership and call to cherish every moment."
11353,"A 20–30-foot section of fiberglass boat was spotted off Oregon’s coast this week and towed into Newport Harbor by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. Officials believe it washed across the Pacific after Japan’s March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami. Onboard were live yellowtail jack fish native to Japanese waters. Biologists from the Oregon Coast Aquarium and OSU’s Hatfield Marine Science Center judged the invasive risk minimal. The boat debris will be dried, further examined, and landfilled; the fish will go to the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Former Australia captain Richie Benaud, who later became one of cricket’s most celebrated broadcasters, has died at age 84 after treatment for skin cancer. Cricket Australia hailed him as a record-breaking leg-spinner, captain and “most impersonated” commentator; he played 64 Tests, never lost a series in 28 as captain (1958/59–1963/64), led the first full Australian tour of India and Pakistan (1959/60), and was the first player to record 2,000 Test runs and 200 wickets. Inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985, Benaud spent over four decades with the BBC, his witty one-liners beloved from Sydney to South London.

Tributes poured in worldwide. Prime Minister Tony Abbott praised Benaud’s insights, ordered flags at half-mast on his funeral day and extended condolences to his wife Daphne and family. Current captain Michael Clarke and leg-spin great Shane Warne shared personal remembrances on Instagram. BBC’s Jonathan Agnew and writer Gideon Haigh lauded his authoritative, dignified style, while coach Darren Lehmann recalled the high standards Benaud set both on and off the field.

International figures including Pakistan’s Imran Khan, Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara and UK Prime Minister David Cameron also mourned “the great voice of cricket,” underscoring Benaud’s enduring influence on the game."
11356,"Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner who survived a Taliban assassination attempt, has now had her name given to an asteroid. NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer—who discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010 while at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and also consults for PBS—chose “316201 Malala” (aka 2010 ML48) to honor Malala’s fight for girls’ schooling and to recognize the contributions of women of color. 

316201 Malala orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter every 5½ years. It measures about 4 kilometers across and has a very dark, toner-colored surface. Mainzer argues that educating girls worldwide unlocks human potential by tapping “the brainpower of all smart people” to address humanity’s toughest challenges."
11366,"An explosive device hidden in a woman’s handbag detonated around 8:30 p.m. Thursday outside the Bauchi Motor Park bus station in Gombe, northeastern Nigeria, killing at least five people and wounding more than a dozen. The bag was left beside a Jos-bound bus after the woman feigned waiting for passengers and disappeared. Witnesses reported horrific injuries—limbs blown off and an eye gouged out—and the bus caught fire. No group has claimed responsibility, but Boko Haram, which has stepped up attacks on soft targets amid regional military pressure, is the chief suspect. This was the first such attack since last weekend’s presidential election won by Muhammadu Buhari."
11370,"At the Summit of the Americas in Panama, President Obama’s spotlight‐grabbing handshake with Cuba’s Raul Castro underscores his broader aim: to halt Washington’s waning influence in Latin America. While China, Russia and Iran have been deepening ties there, past U.S. summits have been derailed by diplomatic disasters—from Hugo Chávez’s 2009 gift of the anti-U.S. tract Open Veins of Latin America to Obama’s embarrassment at the Cartagena meeting when Secret Service agents hired prostitutes. In contrast to the Clinton years’ clear message of democracy, free trade (NAFTA) and growth, Obama must now articulate a coherent vision that resonates with a region craving prosperity, human rights and the rule of law. Missteps—like modest sanctions on Venezuela that fuel Nicolas Maduro’s claim of U.S. meddling—risk reviving old resentments. By engaging Cuban dissidents and aligning U.S. policy with Latin American desires for freedom and economic opportunity, Obama can turn a symbolic détente into a lasting partnership."
11384,"The author opens with a personal memory of being groped on a crowded Mumbai train at age 13—a trauma she only recently shared—and links it to the everyday reality faced by countless women in India. Reports of men masturbating on buses, stalking girls, taking photos without consent, persistent leers and catcalls are backed by a study showing 80 percent of Mumbai women have been harassed in public. Although Indian law prohibits sexual violence in public and at work, cultural stigma, fear of police inaction, and worries about family “disrepute” keep most women silent: fewer than ten out of 2,000 workshop participants had ever reported abuse. Drawing on two high-profile cases—the resignations of UN panel head Rajendra Pachauri and media mogul Tarun Tejpal following staff allegations—the author argues that speaking up can force accountability and is the first step toward reclaiming power and ending harassment as a “normal” part of daily life."
11395,"Mountaineers have returned to Everest after last year’s deadliest season, when an April 18, 2014, glacial collapse at Khumbu Icefall killed 16 Nepali climbers. To reduce risk, Nepal’s local committee of Sherpas has reopened a longer central route through the Icefall—used in the 1990s but abandoned for speed—to avoid the site of the accident. This year Nepal issued 347 permits (up from 334), and teams have not yet entered the Icefall. The new path crosses more crevasses and requires additional ladders, so the committee advises limiting gear weight; climbers estimate it adds about an hour but won’t “change the game.” One outfitter, Alpenglow Expeditions, is instead sending clients north from Tibet, where the route has no icefall; China has granted 320 permits (136 more than last year). Nepali guides, whose livelihoods depend on Everest tourism, worry climbers will choose the Chinese side. Many Sherpas, still grieving friends killed in 2014, return with anxious families. Among the climbers back is Jon Reiter, who survived last year’s avalanche and says the mountains’ pull outweighs the danger."
11400,"The author argues that a surge in direct-to-consumer lab testing—spurred by endorsements from figures like Mark Cuban and Taylor Swift and laws letting patients order tests without a doctor’s referral—is more likely to drive up medical care than improve health. With over a thousand tests available, widespread screening of well people yields common “abnormal” results that prompt extra visits, anxiety, invasive procedures and overtreatment (for example, prostate, breast and thyroid cancers). Although individual tests may become cheaper, overall costs will climb through higher test volumes and follow-up care. While diagnostic testing remains vital for acute medical problems, testing healthy individuals often does more harm than good. The author concludes that rather than banning self-testing, regulators (notably the FDA) should oversee it and the public should be educated about the limits and potential harms of indiscriminate medical testing."
11410,"Canada’s CF-18 Hornets carried out their first airstrike against ISIS in Syria, bombing a militant garrison near Raqqa under an expanded mandate announced last month by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The Department of National Defence described the operation as successful and said all aircraft and crews returned safely, though it did not report casualty figures. Canada, which has been striking ISIS targets in Iraq since November as part of the U.S.-led coalition, joins U.S. forces—bombing ISIS in Iraq since August and in Syria since September—and other Western and Middle Eastern partners in efforts to curb the extremist group. Defense Minister Jason Kenney called ISIS a “genocidal terrorist organization” that must not be allowed safe haven. ISIS has spread beyond Iraq and Syria, imposing a harsh interpretation of Islam on captured areas, killing thousands, and persecuting minorities."
11768,"A Houston couple, Danielle and Adam Busby, welcomed the world’s first surviving all-female quintuplets since 1969 on April 8 at Woman’s Hospital of Texas. Delivered by C-section at 28 weeks and two days, the five girls—Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige—joined big sister Blayke in their new family of eight. Danielle, who conceived via intrauterine insemination, praised her medical team and credits God for the outcome; the family is chronicling their journey on the blog “It’s a Buzz World.” Although early reports called them the first U.S. all-girl quintuplets, archival clippings reveal a 1959 San Antonio set that sadly all died within 24 hours.  
  
Separately, Sharon and Korey Rademacher surprised relatives by keeping both the gender and the fact they were having twins under wraps. When Sharon gave birth to Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith at West Florida Hospital in Pensacola on March 11, the family captured everyone’s reaction on video. Posted to YouTube, the clip has been viewed over 700,000 times—raising the question, could you have kept such news a secret?"
11779,"A federal court–mandated revision to the U.S. no-fly list redress process now requires that American citizens and lawful permanent residents who are barred from commercial flights be formally told they are on the list, given the criteria for their placement “to the extent feasible,” and allowed to submit written challenges with supporting materials. The change, announced in Justice Department filings this week, responds to a June ruling that the prior practice—which neither confirmed nor denied individuals’ list status—violated due-process rights under the Fifth Amendment. The original ruling arose from an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of 13 Americans. While the government says the enhanced DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program will give affected travelers initial and, upon request, more detailed explanations of why they were listed, the ACLU contends the new procedures still fall short of constitutional standards because they lack meaningful notice, evidence disclosure, and a hearing. Under the revised policy, after receiving the government’s final written decision, travelers may further dispute their status; the Transportation Security Administration will issue the ultimate determination."
11791,"A Texas veterinarian, Dr. Kristen Lindsey, posted a Facebook photo this week showing herself smiling as she dangled an orange tabby by an arrow through its head. In her caption she celebrated it as her “first bow kill” and called it “Vet of the year,” adding that “the only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it.” Outraged callers crashed the website and flooded the phones of Washington County’s Animal Clinic, where Lindsey worked. An animal rescuer claimed the cat—known as “Tiger”—was a missing pet of an elderly couple, not a feral tom, though CNN could not confirm that. Lindsey initially boasted she would keep her job, but the clinic fired her, covered her name on its marquee with duct tape and issued a statement distancing itself from her actions. The Austin County sheriff’s office is investigating, and Lindsey could face animal cruelty charges. Alley Cat Allies is offering a $7,500 reward for information leading to an arrest. While activists demand full prosecution, some clients have defended Lindsey’s veterinary skills and sent her messages of support."
11795,"A CNN affiliate (WMAR) video shows a Baltimore mother dragging her masked teenage son—dressed in dark pants, a black hoodie and backpack—out of a rioting crowd, repeatedly smacking him and yelling “Get the f--- over here!” after recognizing him on TV throwing rocks at police. The woman, in light blue jeans, a yellow lace tunic and cropped yellow jacket, remains unnamed. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts praised her intervention, saying he wished more parents “took charge” of their children during the unrest."
11808,"Heavy April aftershocks have left villages east of Kathmandu in Kavre District struggling amid widespread damage and little outside help. The main highway shows half-meter fissures patched with rubble, slowing travel toward Ravi Opi—a farming community 30 km from the capital reached only by a winding dirt track. A local official reports 90 percent of its homes are uninhabitable, with many villagers too frightened to re-enter crumbling structures.  
   
In Ravi Opi, 62-year-old Maili Tamang still sits beside the ruins of her two-story house, her injured leg dressed in a blood-soaked bandage. She and her daughter-in-law escaped the collapse but suffered wounds; the younger woman was treated at a missionary hospital 12 km away. Meanwhile, 31-year-old Mahesh Koiraba lost his two-year-old daughter, Prati, when their home fell in around her.  
   
With no government aid in sight, survivors clear debris by hand, cook outdoors, and shelter in makeshift shacks as rain and aftershocks hamper relief. More remote villages, accessible only on foot, have yet to hear how many lives the quake claimed or when help will arrive. Reported by Arwa Damon and Euan McKirdy."
11817,"On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Jeremy Renner—best known as Marvel’s archer Hawkeye—sat at the piano to unveil a secret talent for Ed Sheeran parodies, singing a spoof of “Thinking Out Loud” that brags about his scarves and berets, trombone skills and pickle-jar–opening prowess. Though he insists he’s more than just an archer (“I’ve got powers too!”), he jokes that Thor would still beat him in a fight. Renner has backed up his comic-relief chops with dramatic turns in both Avengers films, the Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker, American Hustle and entries in the Bourne and Mission: Impossible series."
11821,"Director Bryan Singer has confirmed via Instagram that Olivia Munn will portray telepathic mutant Psylocke (Betsy Braddock) in X-Men: Apocalypse, the follow-up to Days of Future Past. Production is underway on the summer 2016 release, which hits theaters May 27, 2016. Psylocke—a long-running X-Men character created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe for the 1970s–’80s Captain Britain comics and introduced to the X-Men in Uncanny X-Men #213 (1987)—has been a fixture in titles like Exiles and X-Force. Munn joins a cast led by James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence; she is represented by Creative Artists Agency and Atlas Artists."
11826,"Stephen Hawking has teamed up with Monty Python to record a new version of the troupe’s 1983 “Galaxy Song” from The Meaning of Life, timed for Record Store Day as a 7-inch single and digital download. In the promotional video, scientist Brian Cox criticizes the song’s scientific accuracy until Hawking—seated in his wheelchair—arrives, knocks over Cox and continues singing in his trademark computerized voice before rocketing into the stratosphere for a kaleidoscopic tour of the cosmos. Originally written by Eric Idle and John Du Prez as a witty yet informative pop-song lecture on the universe, Hawking’s release follows his earlier musical cameo on Pink Floyd’s “Talkin’ Hawkin’.”"
11838,"A woman recalls being 12 when she and her family joined the 1980 Miami protest against the acquittal of officers who beat motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie to death. That unrest, the first major “race riot” since the 1960s, mirrored earlier uprisings—in Harlem (1964), Watts (1965), Newark and Detroit (1967)—and later ones in Los Angeles (1992) and Baltimore (2015). Each was triggered by perceived unjust police actions and underpinned by racism, poverty, poor housing and lack of political power, as documented by the Kerner and Christopher Commissions. Moderating a panel on riots as “the voice of the unheard,” she learned that participants feel hopeless and dehumanized, yet that past riots spurred legislative and policy reforms. She contrasts destructive violence with the enduring power of nonviolent protest—championed by her parents, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and current leaders like Rev. Jamal Bryant—and notes how peaceful demonstrations after Michael Brown’s death led to a Justice Department report and recommended policing reforms."
11839,"On Sunday night, the Israeli military carried out airstrikes in the occupied Golan Heights against four militants who had crossed over from Syria and were allegedly attempting to plant an explosive device on the Israeli border. According to the IDF, the strikes prevented a planned bombing targeting its forces. Israeli media, citing military sources, reported that three of the attackers were killed; their affiliation remains unknown. The Golan Heights—seized from Syria in the 1967 war and later annexed by Israel—is internationally regarded as occupied territory and is home to about 41,000 residents, including Jews, Druze and Alawites."
11840,"A viral logic puzzle from Singapore asks solvers to deduce “Cheryl’s birthday” from a list of ten possible dates (May 15, 16, 19; June 17, 18; July 14, 16; August 14, 15, 17). It was first posed by TV host Kenneth Kong as a challenge in the April 8 Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. By analyzing a brief, truthful exchange between two informed friends, Albert and Bernard, one can eliminate nine dates and pinpoint the correct birthday. The problem sparked widespread online debate, inspiring video explanations by Georgia Tech’s Matt Baker and write-ups in outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post."
11858,"In rural Scott and Jackson counties in Indiana, a major HIV outbreak tied to injection use of the opioid Opana has grown since mid-December. As of Friday, 142 people (136 confirmed, six preliminary) in these counties—which together have only a few thousand residents—have tested positive. The CDC and state health officials, citing sparse local medical resources (Scott County has one non-specialist infectious-disease doctor), declared a public-health emergency in March and deployed Indiana University volunteers to run a weekly clinic offering HIV testing, treatment and door-to-door needle-sharing education; 33 patients have attended so far. Younger users, unfamiliar with HIV’s earlier peak in the 1980s, have driven much of the spread. Governor Mike Pence has issued and extended a 30-day executive order allowing needle exchanges, which studies show reduce new infections. Dr. Joan Duwve noted that long-standing prescription drug abuse along the Ohio River fosters generational “community” needle sharing. Opana requires multiple daily injections—often 4–10 times with large-gauge needles—heightening blood exposure and infection risk. With injection drug use rising nationally, hepatitis C climbed 150% from 2010 to 2013. Dr. Jonathan Mermin warned that vigilance and education are essential to prevent HIV and other diseases from resurging."
11860,"Leslie Morris, a friend of more than 44 years, has petitioned the court (on April 28) to be named conservator for singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, who was hospitalized at UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious at home. Morris’s filing describes Mitchell as still unconscious and unable to meet her personal needs, whereas a statement on Mitchell’s website—approved by Morris—says she is alert, comprehends her surroundings, not in a coma, and expected to make a full recovery. Publicist Alisse Kingsley confirmed the website’s version as accurate. A doctor’s declaration indicates Mitchell will likely be unable to attend court hearings for the next four to six months. Fans have been posting tributes on WeLoveYouJoni.com. Reporters Sonya Hamasaki and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this story."
11870,"A new book by Peter Schweizer, Clinton Cash, due May 5, claims that foreign governments (e.g., the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Canada) and companies with business before the U.S. government gave large sums to Clinton family charities—raising potential conflict-of-interest questions, such as Canada’s role in the Keystone XL pipeline review—and that banks under investigation sponsored Clinton Global Initiative events. Yet, absent proof of quid pro quo, it’s hard to fault donations aimed at charitable causes, and there’s no evidence the Clintons knew of donors’ legal troubles. More troubling, the foundations have suffered chronic mismanagement—running deficits (about $40 million in 2007–08, $8 million in 2012), overexpanding, and falling victim to a con man’s bogus $50 million pledge. But since these problems are already public, the author argues little new will emerge; voters, preoccupied with jobs, schools and taxes, appear unconcerned. A Rasmussen poll finds 57 percent expect Hillary to win in 2016, and she herself has dismissed such conflicts as mere “distractions.”"
11875,"Andrew Lesnie, the 59-year-old Sydney-born cinematographer best known for his decade-long collaboration with director Peter Jackson on the six “Lord of the Rings” and “Hobbit” films, has died of a heart attack. An Oscar winner for “The Fellowship of the Ring” (2001), he also shot Jackson’s “King Kong” (2005) and “The Lovely Bones” (2009), Rupert Wyatt’s “Rise of the Planet of the Apes” (2011), Francis Lawrence’s “I Am Legend” (2007), M. Night Shyamalan’s “The Last Airbender” (2010) and Craig Monahan’s “Healing” (2014). His final project was Russell Crowe’s directorial debut, “The Water Diviner,” which opened in U.S. theaters the week of his death; Crowe praised him on Twitter as “the master of the light.” Lesnie was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002 and began his career after studying at TAFE and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, working his way up from ABC camera assistant through shorts, music videos, documentaries and commercials.  "
11877,"In 2014, ambush attacks were the leading cause of felonious line-of-duty deaths among U.S. police officers. Despite this, Google’s Waze app—acquired in 2013—includes a “traffic cop” feature that lets any user mark and view real-time police locations. While many employ it to avoid tickets, criminals can exploit it to target officers: before killing two NYPD officers in December, Ismaaiyl Brinsley used Waze to track their patrol car and posted screenshots online. Beyond violence, Waze can aid drunk drivers, speeders, domestic abusers, gang members or terrorists in evading law enforcement. Although Google touts its social responsibility and the app’s public-safety benefits, its executives have refused to meet with the National Sheriffs’ Association to address these risks. Law-enforcement groups urge Google to collaborate on safeguards that protect both motorists and officers."
11888,"Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe created “Toy Soldiers” to challenge our desensitization to war images. Drawing on his landscape background, he traveled to Western Sahara—a long-disputed, sparsely covered conflict zone—to stage real Polisario Front fighters as if they were green plastic toy soldiers against its stark desert battlefields. Working under his wide-angle lens, Thorpe obtained military and, when needed, UN clearances to pose groups of 50–60 troops atop improvised oil-drum platforms. Over five weeks of sweltering autumn days and nights under the stars, he shot at historic battle sites from dusk till dawn. By revealing that the figures are real soldiers, Thorpe aims to spark fresh emotional and political responses and to question how we will consume war imagery amid dwindling attention spans. His book “Toy Soldiers” is available for pre-order from Dewi Lewis Publishing."
11900,"A gunman entered a third-floor campus building at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina, on Monday and fatally shot longtime print shop operator Ron Lane. The college was immediately placed on lockdown, all buildings were cleared, and the suspect remains at large. Maj. Tom Effler of the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office called the incident “isolated, not random.” Law enforcement has identified the suspect as 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, a former student who once worked for Lane, and described him as “armed and dangerous.” College President Kay Albertson expressed sorrow over the loss, praised the swift multi-agency response, and said the school will reach out to the victim’s family. Earlier reports that the shooting occurred in the library were incorrect. During the building sweep, authorities deployed tear gas into a restroom, but the occupant was not the suspect. According to fall 2013 data, the college enrolls 3,837 students (slightly over half part-time), and from 2011 to 2013 recorded no violent crimes on campus, with only three illegal weapons arrests in each of 2012 and 2013."
11908,"Colorado’s New Belgium Brewery and Ben & Jerry’s are collaborating on a salted-caramel-brownie–inspired beer to raise awareness for causes they both support. While details of the joint campaign remain under wraps, Ben & Jerry’s Senior Global Marketing Manager Jay Curley calls it “impactful,” and New Belgium’s Director of Sustainability Jenn Vervier promises “delicious” results. The beer—slated for a fall release—will be the first of its kind from two certified B Corporations, each renowned for social and environmental activism (from sustainable agriculture and climate action to fair trade and marriage equality). Details will be revealed later this year."
11910,"In the first Final Four game, No. 1 Kentucky’s bid for a 39-0 season ended as Wisconsin rallied from a 60-56 deficit with 6:39 remaining to win 71-64. Frank Kaminsky paced the Badgers with 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Sam Dekker added 16. Wisconsin out-rebounded Kentucky by 12 and held the Wildcats scoreless over the final five minutes. Kentucky’s leading scorers were freshman Karl-Anthony Towns (16), Andrew Harrison (13) and Aaron Harrison (12). Coach John Calipari lamented his team’s inability to defend and rebound, despite solid shooting metrics.

In the nightcap, Duke dominated Michigan State 81-61. Freshman Justise Winslow led the Blue Devils with 19 points, Jahlil Okafor had 18 (including 10 in the first half), and Quinn Cook scored 17. Michigan State opened with an eight-point lead behind Denzel Valentine’s three early threes, but Duke’s mix of 2-3 zone and man-to-man defense stifled the Spartans thereafter. Duke turned a nine-point halftime edge into a 20-point cushion in the second half and never looked back. Coach Mike Krzyzewski praised his team’s defensive effort fueling its offense. On Monday, Duke will face Wisconsin for the national title; a win would give Duke its fifth championship."
11911,"Saudi warplanes resumed airstrikes in southern Yemen on Wednesday after Houthi rebels called for U.N. peace talks “only after a complete halt of attacks.” The previous round of negotiations collapsed in January when rebels struck President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi’s residence in Sanaa. Riyadh had declared its month-long Operation Decisive Storm over and launched a “political‐process” phase called Operation Renewal of Hope, but resumed bombing after a rebel attack on a government brigade in Taiz, where five strikes on a weapons depot were reported. Meanwhile, Houthis freed Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi, whom they had detained near Aden on March 26. The U.N. had demanded his release. Saudi Arabia says its campaign—launched March 26 with coalition partners—has degraded Houthi military infrastructure and aims to restore Hadi’s government. Hadi, backed by Riyadh, vowed to rebuild Yemen’s military and urged the Houthis to withdraw. In the south, two U.S. drone strikes killed six al-Qaeda suspects near Mukalla, and U.S. forces are conducting maritime security operations off Yemen."
11922,"Iraqi officials inside Ramadi warn the city is on the brink of falling to ISIS after militants pressed advances from the north, south and especially the east over the past week. Falih Essawi, deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, told CNN from a front line inside Ramadi that security forces—already straining under months of fighting—are collapsing and urgently need Iraqi reinforcements and U.S.-led coalition air support. He reported at least 10 Iraqi troops killed and more than 100 wounded in one day of clashes and pleaded, “Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi?” 

ISIS has pushed into the eastern suburbs of Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem and Soufia and is reportedly rolling into central Ramadi, leaving only western outskirts in government hands. The offensive has triggered a massive civilian exodus: Essawi estimated 150,000 people fled on foot since Wednesday morning, many using carts to carry elderly relatives. CNN teams encountered families who said Iraqi forces abruptly withdrew from Albu Ghanem, allowing ISIS fighters to set up sniper nests on their rooftops and forcing them to abandon their homes.

Ramadi has been fiercely contested since ISIS first seized parts of the city last year. Despite seven U.S.-led airstrikes there since Monday, a U.S. military spokesman said the city remains contested and its fall is “not imminent.” Nonetheless, residents and local leaders say only immediate military assistance can prevent Ramadi’s complete takeover."
11932,"Equal Pay Day falls on April 14, the date to which women must work into the new year to earn what men did by December 31—reflecting that women currently make 77 cents for every dollar earned by men (even less for women of color). Over a 40-year career this gap costs the average woman about $431,000, and simply closing it would lift half of working single mothers out of poverty and boost consumer-driven growth.  

The author urges Hillary Clinton—who portrays herself as a populist but is widely seen as wealthy and out of touch—to make a highly symbolic political gesture: if elected, she should take a 23 percent pay cut (reducing the $400,000 presidential salary to about $308,000) and refuse any raise until the gender wage gap is closed. Such a stunt would underscore nationwide pay inequity, reinforce her commitment to working women, and harness today’s image-driven politics to highlight and spur real policy change for America’s 158 million female workers."
11945,"Today’s jihadi groups—most notably ISIS and its offshoot Boko Haram—use extreme medieval cruelties amplified by modern technology not only to terrorize and recruit, but to advance a broader plan: building an immediate, Sharia-based “caliphate.” Killing men wins territory; enslaving women helps construct the daily life of the state. Captured women and girls—especially non-Muslims like the Yazidis—are herded into “slave warehouses,” paraded in groups for selection as “wives” or sexual slaves, and subjected to organized rape, forced marriage, and conversion. Human Rights Watch labels these actions war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. Boko Haram’s kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls follows the same pattern. Unlike al-Qaeda, which viewed a caliphate as a distant goal, ISIS aggressively imposes seventh-century–style social structures, viewing women as indispensable for cooking, childbearing, and maintaining households under brutal restrictions. Many survivors report attempted suicide. ISIS even cites religious texts to justify enslaving women and proclaims, “We will … enslave your women, by the permission of Allah.” In Mosul and other seized areas, Muslim women endure total loss of freedom and lives ruled by fear—evidence that this systematic brutality is a calculated means to control women and cement the jihadis’ envisioned society."
11948,"SpaceX is set to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral to the International Space Station on Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET, after weather forced a Monday scrub. The mission’s headline feature is an attempt to land the booster upright on an autonomous drone ship in the Atlantic—a never-before-accomplished move aimed at slashing launch costs by up to 100-fold. After a January crash landing and with success odds around 50%, SpaceX will post photos and YouTube video of the effort and plans repeated sea—and eventually ground—recoveries if needed.

Following stage separation, the upper stage will place the uncrewed Dragon capsule into orbit, then burn up on reentry. Dragon will dock with the ISS two days later, delivering over 4,300 lb of supplies—among them research equipment and an “ISSpresso” coffee maker. About five weeks later, the crew will load more than 3,000 lb of experiments, trash and other items for return; controllers will then guide Dragon to a splashdown in the Pacific off California. This marks SpaceX’s sixth ISS mission and the first by any private company to dock with the station."
11979,"Jurors in the trial of 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, accused of planting two homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon, have deliberated over seven hours and sent two questions back to the judge. Tsarnaev faces 30 federal counts—including using a weapon of mass destruction and terrorism charges—with 17 counts eligible for the death penalty or life imprisonment. 

Prosecutors showed graphic videos and photos of the April 15 bomb blasts that killed three bystanders—a graduate student from China, an 8-year-old boy and a 29-year-old woman—and maimed dozens more, including the boy’s sister. They argued Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, intended to “terrorize” civilians on Patriots’ Day and quoted Tsarnaev’s “manifesto” denouncing U.S. policy toward Muslims. 

Defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded her client’s role but portrayed him as under the sway of his radicalized brother, who died in a police shootout days later, and urged jurors to spare his life. If Tsarnaev is convicted on any capital count, the trial will move to a penalty phase weighing aggravating factors against his background and mental-health evidence."
12008,"Millennial attitudes  
• Many young adults now view marriage as optional—a choice deferred or replaced by career, travel and personal happiness. In interviews with 21-year-olds at Kent State, students said they’d rather invest in their degrees or European trips than a costly wedding and saw no need for a ring to prove commitment. Some are even content to stay single forever if it means being debt-free and fulfilled.  

Growing divorce and remarriage  
• U.S. divorce and remarriage rates have risen sharply since 1960; today about 42 million adults have been married more than once, and 23 percent of currently married adults are in second-plus unions. A Pew survey finds half of Americans believe people can lead satisfying lives without marrying or having children—and two-thirds of those are aged 18–29.  

Economic and cultural perspectives  
• Economists link two-earner households with greater well-being, though wealth itself may drive marriage prospects. Many millennials delay marriage because of student debt. In Scandinavia—where 80 percent of first children are born out of wedlock—cohabitation is the norm, marriage brings few legal or social advantages, and high quality-of-life scores accompany low marriage rates.  

Author’s reflection  
• Writing from personal experience—she married at 38 after years of hesitancy—the author acknowledges the practical and emotional benefits she’s found in marriage, but leaves open whether a mostly single society could fare just as well."
12060,"Iraqi security forces, backed by some 20,000 Iranian-supported Shiite militiamen and U.S.-led airstrikes, have recaptured Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit from ISIS nearly a year after it fell. Troops moving through the Sunni-majority city found hundreds of IEDs and booby-trapped vehicles—including an explosive-laden digger—and conducted controlled detonations as they cleared buildings. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory on Wednesday and continued rooting out isolated militants, saying full control would soon be restored. Officials, however, warned that Shiite fighters might exact “scorched earth” reprisals for last year’s massacre of Shiite cadets by ISIS, risking sectarian backlash. ISIS’s nine-month rule in Tikrit saw mass graves, the destruction of an ancient church, and the killing of more than 1,500 air force cadets. The operation’s success paves the way for a planned offensive to retake Mosul this spring."
12068,"The International Committee of the Red Cross has called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen to allow urgent delivery of food, water, fuel and medical care—especially around the port city of Aden—warning that many wounded will die without treatment within hours. Its appeal came just before the U.N. Security Council met to discuss a Russian draft resolution urging a halt to Saudi-led coalition airstrikes; the measure omitted any call for Houthi rebels to stand down or for political negotiations, and no decision was reached. Meanwhile, the fiercest Saudi raids yet struck military bases in Sanaa. 

The fighting stems from January’s takeover of the capital by the Shiite Houthi rebels, who deposed President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi; Hadi fled first to Aden, then Saudi Arabia, prompting a regional air campaign. Saudi special forces have supplied arms and communications to pro-Hadi fighters in Aden. In the past two weeks at least 519 people have been killed and 1,700 wounded, with tens of thousands displaced to Somalia and Djibouti; Aden suffered 58 deaths and 200 injuries in two days. In eastern Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula controls territory, recently freeing leader Khaled Batarfi from jail. France evacuated 44 people, including nationals, from the port of Balhaf."
12073,"NYPD Detective Patrick Cherry, who holds a top-secret clearance and works on the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, apologized after a viral video showed him angrily yelling at an Uber driver, mocking the driver’s accent, threatening arrest, and citing alleged traffic violations. The January  incident—recorded by passenger Sanjay Seth—led to Cherry’s reassignment to modified duty and an Internal Affairs Bureau inquiry; he could face suspension or lose his clearance. Police Commissioner William Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio publicly condemned the behavior as unacceptable, while the Detectives’ Endowment Association defended Cherry’s overall record. Uber said it is supporting its driver, and the Civilian Complaint Review Board is also interviewing witnesses and will make disciplinary recommendations."
13806,"Cameron Hardin’s third week as Big Brother 25 Head of Household ended with him nominating Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes, then winning the Power of Veto to keep those two on the block. At the October 5 eviction, every voting houseguest (including Cory, Cirie, Blue, Matt, Jag, America and Bowie) cast their ballots to evict Mecole, sending her out by a 7–0 vote. As she left, Mecole called out Cory and America as her targets.

The next Head of Household competition tested players on “Instagram-style” photos displayed in the house. After Bowie Jane and Felicia tied with perfect scores, a tiebreaker question about Jared Fields’s “zombie” minutes gave Bowie the win—her first HOH title—for Week 10. She will hold her nomination ceremony on October 6.

Additional notes from the BB25 world: Cirie Fields set a new franchise record; CBS is reportedly developing an all-winners season for winter; and the official Traitors 2 cast (featuring veterans from Big Brother, Survivor and The Bachelor) was announced. Big Brother 25 airs on CBS."
13814,"On October 12, 2023, the Social Security Administration announced a 3.2% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for January 2024, boosting monthly payments for over 66 million beneficiaries by an average of more than $50 (about $57.30 on a $1,790 benefit). The taxable earnings cap will rise to $168,600 (up from $160,200). The COLA is tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. Beneficiaries will receive notices in early December and can view or set alerts in their My Social Security account through November 14. For 2024 Medicare changes, visit medicare.gov.

13815,"Tonee Turner, a 22-year-old Pittsburgh artist and part-time ceramics teacher, disappeared on December 30, 2019, after last being seen at Dobra Tea. Her sister last spoke to her around 6:00 p.m. that day. Family members have been distributing flyers across the city. A bicyclist later found Tonee’s purse—containing her phone, wallet, and keys—near a bridge off Interstate 80 by Homestead, suggesting she may have traveled that route. Tonee is 5′3″, 130 lbs, with chin-length black or dark brown hair, brown eyes, multiple facial piercings, and a spiral tattoo on her left shoulder. She was wearing a black zip-up jacket, a gray “Habla Espanol” shirt, gray cargo pants, and possibly a black head wrap.

13816,"The article “Debunking the Hype: Xanax’s Effectiveness for Treating Anxiety” reviews what is known—and often misunderstood—about alprazolam (Xanax). Key points:  
• Xanax is a benzodiazepine that boosts GABA activity in the brain, producing a rapid calming effect.  
• Its quick onset makes it useful for acute anxiety or emergency relief.  
• With continued use, patients can develop tolerance, requiring higher doses and risking dependence and withdrawal.  
• For long-term anxiety control, non-drug strategies (therapy, lifestyle change) or other medications are generally preferred; if Xanax is used chronically, close medical supervision and addressing underlying causes are vital.  
• Ultimately, Xanax can be a valuable short-term tool but must be balanced within a broader, professionally guided treatment plan."
13823,"U.S. Army units from Fort Cavazos (Killeen) and Fort Bliss (El Paso) are part of a 900-troop deployment to the Middle East aimed at defending U.S. forces against drone and rocket attacks. This move follows at least 12 strikes in Iraq and four in Syria over the past week—plus one recent unsuccessful attempt—that have caused 21 minor injuries, most traumatic brain injuries. Soldiers from Fort Bliss will primarily operate a THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) battery (requiring nearly 100 personnel), while others from both Texas bases will serve as air-defense headquarters. The balance of the 900 troops will staff Patriot batteries from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Patriot and Avenger batteries from Fort Liberty, North Carolina. Department of Defense spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed the forces will bolster regional deterrence and force protection but are not deploying to Israel."
13827,"Big Brother 25 spoilers reveal that new Head of Household Bowie Jane is under pressure to backdoor Cameron Hardin, whom the other houseguests view as a “competition beast.” Although Cameron’s allies Matt Klotz and Jag Bains (together known as “The Fugitives”) are aligned with him, Jag now agrees Cameron must go—while Bowie has instead nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields, seeing both as threats to her own game. Cameron, meanwhile, wants Bowie to target Cory Wurtrnberger, whom he calls the bigger threat, and Cory has been lobbying Bowie to pull Cameron down now. Bowie has so far refused to name Cameron as a replacement nominee, but Cory is expected to keep pushing. This week’s Power of Veto players are Bowie, Felicia, Cirie, Jag, Matt and America Lopez, with Cory hosting. If Bowie, Jag or Matt wins Veto, nominations stay the same; if America, Cirie or Felicia wins, Bowie must replace the removed nominee—and could choose Cory. The Veto competition takes place Saturday evening. Fans are left wondering whether Bowie will finally take a shot at Cameron or Cory."
13829,"Cameron Hardin was “backdoored” in Week 10 of Big Brother 25 after repeatedly winning challenges and failing to connect with several houseguests—most notably drawing Felicia Cannon’s claim that he had an “evil spirit.” In the subsequent HOH competition, Jag Bains emerged as Secret HOH via a BB Comics challenge and covertly nominated Blue Kim and Felicia for eviction, leaving both furious. Felicia and Cirie Fields both regretted Cameron’s departure—Felicia missed his upfront play, Cirie also knew Jag was pulling the strings—and Blue immediately saw Cameron’s warning about her own targeting prove true. Week 11 brings a Double Veto that will significantly shake up the game, and another houseguest will soon join Cameron in the jury house. Blue now has a chance to save herself. In other news, BB24 alum Michael Bruner recently married, and Cameron’s exit interview highlighted who he thinks is playing the best and worst games. Big Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10/9c, Tuesdays at 8/7c, and Thursdays at 9/8c on CBS."
13834,"Bowie Jane won her first Head of Household challenge in Week 10 of Big Brother 25 and, with advice from Cameron Hardin, nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields—old rivals she still resents. At the OTEV Power of Veto competition, Jag Bains emerged victorious (while Felicia claimed Bowie Jane threw it and Cirie said America Lopez did). Jag plans to use the veto, and Bowie Jane intends to backdoor Cameron Hardin as the replacement nominee, which would send him to the jury for the first time if it holds. Cirie has asked Jag to keep Felicia on the block for a week off nomination, while Matt Klotz refuses to hear negative reports about Cameron or Cirie. The Veto Meeting is set for Monday, October 9, and with shifting alliances—especially Bowie Jane’s ties to Jag and Matt—the outcome remains uncertain.

13840,"New York’s House Republicans have filed a privileged motion to expel Rep. George Santos following the unsealing of 23 new federal criminal charges against him—including unauthorized use of campaign donors’ credit cards and identity theft—and longstanding allegations that he fabricated much of his résumé. Led by Rep. Anthony D’Esposito and backed by fellow New York Republicans Nick LaLota, Marc Molinaro and Mike Lawler, the effort asserts Santos “is not fit to serve.” A vote on his removal is scheduled for next week, but Santos has vowed not to resign. With Republicans holding only a 221–212 majority, leadership may choose to table the measure or send it to committee rather than risk losing the 78 GOP votes needed—on top of all Democrats—for the required two-thirds (290-member) majority. Regardless of the outcome, Santos’s controversies are expected to persist."
13842,"Jeff Probst has clarified Survivor’s “sit-out” rule for Season 45: castaways may no longer skip two challenges in a row—whoever sits out one challenge must compete in the next. Under the old rule (resetting after each Tribal Council), shorter 26-day seasons sometimes let players sit out multiple immunity challenges in a row, prompting fan complaints. The change was driven in part by Claire Rafson’s three straight immunity sit-outs on Season 44, which sparked backlash from viewers and fellow contestants and led Probst to address the issue on his On Fire podcast. New Wednesday episodes run 90 minutes (a possible byproduct of the Hollywood strikes) and stream on Paramount+. Meanwhile, Hannah Rose explained why she quit early on Season 45 and asked to be voted out, drawing social-media criticism, and recently eliminated Brandon Donlon recounted completing a personal goal as well as suffering a panic attack on the show.

Torn between her deepening love for Nick and her strong connection with Adam—intensified when she and Adam sleep together—Sally refuses to decide and even considers walking away from both men. Nick and Adam then physically clash over her, prompting Sally to break up their fight and demand that Nick drop the ultimatum. Viewers are teased that Sally’s ultimate choice will be stunning."

Yet their front four still lacks consistent pressure, with Emmanuel Ogbah (2.5 sacks) and Christian Wilkins underperforming. CBS Sports’ Josina Anderson reports multiple teams are eyeing a trade for Commanders’ defensive end Chase Young, who at 25 has already tallied five sacks this season. Acquiring Young would require a new long-term deal and cap planning but would significantly bolster Miami’s pass rush alongside Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelen Phillips and Bradley Chubb as the Dolphins push for the playoffs."

Last week, the Biden administration added Venezuelans who arrived by July 31 to the Temporary Protected Status pool, potentially speeding permit approvals for many in New York City. USCIS Director Jaddou visited a migrant reception center in the city—where staff hand out informational fliers, answer questions, run a work‐authorization support center and coordinate with the Red Cross—to see firsthand how applications are handled. To accelerate work‐permit issuance, USCIS has streamlined procedures, held library education sessions, sent email and SMS eligibility alerts, and deployed mobile biometric units for fingerprinting. Jaddou says the agency aims to adjudicate applications within 30 days on average. Although USCIS remains funded by filing fees and can operate during a shutdown, Jaddou urged Congress to provide additional appropriations so it can process more work permits and TPS requests."

This development, echoing Cold War Soviet efforts to target U.S. carriers, boosts China’s power projection amid concerns over a potential Taiwan invasion and wider regional conflicts. A recent Pentagon report also warns China plans to double its nuclear warheads from about 500 today to nearly 1,000 by 2030, build over 300 new ICBM silos, and may pursue conventionally armed, intercontinental-range missiles.

The order remains in place until November 13, and both sides will present full arguments on November 7.

Major gifts from the Health Care Council of Illinois’ committee coincided with Harmon’s push for the tax-break provision, which was added via an amendment in May and passed the General Assembly. Harmon has offered no personal comment; his spokesman insists lawmakers act in the public interest. The governor used an amendatory veto to strip out the nursing home language, warning it would shift costs onto local homeowners and small businesses. The nursing home lobby is now seeking a veto override, reportedly with strong support from Harmon’s Senate chief of staff."

In 1962 she entered William Mitchell College of Law, excelled academically, and emerged as a criminal-defense advocate. Over more than 30 years on the bench, she authored 549 opinions noted for clear, principled reasoning; chaired statewide task forces on gender fairness and racial bias; and drove reforms benefiting women, minorities, and the underserved. Nationally, she influenced legal education and accreditation through her work with the American Bar Association. Her career remains a landmark in Minnesota’s pursuit of equal justice."
13916,"A Dollar General employee in Georgia was fired in September 2020 immediately after telling her manager she was pregnant. When she asked to return to work, her manager raised unfounded safety concerns, and she was given a separation notice citing “health reasons.” The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Dollar General for pregnancy discrimination under federal law—including the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act—and the company agreed to pay a $42,500 settlement. The EEOC emphasizes that pregnancy cannot be used to assume an employee’s inability to perform her job and aims to prevent such harmful stereotypes."
13917,"Beginning in January and running into March 2024, JetBlue will discontinue 14 routes—primarily serving its Northeast hubs (Boston Logan, JFK and LaGuardia) and one out of Los Angeles International.  The cuts stem from the 2021 dissolution of its Northeast Alliance with American Airlines and ongoing government ATC staffing shortages.  Affected endpoints include Burlington, Miami, Nashville, Washington DC and nine other cities.  Passengers booked on these routes for 2024 will be rebooked on alternative flights or issued refunds."
13925,"The U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C. announced that former FBI agent David Paitsel and real estate developer Brian Bailey were sentenced for running a bribery scheme to obtain confidential Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) information from the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development. Bailey paid program specialist Dawne Dorsey for un-redacted TOPA sale notices and then enlisted Paitsel—who had exclusive access to tenant contact data—to retrieve tenant details. Paitsel received 24 months in prison (concurrent counts), 24 months’ supervised release, a $100 assessment, and a $10,600 forfeiture judgment. Bailey was sentenced to 48 months in prison (concurrent), 24 months’ supervised release, a $100 assessment, and a $250,000 fine. Dorsey pleaded guilty in June 2019 (sentencing set for November 6, 2023), and Frederick Silvers received a five-month prison term for bribing Dorsey."
13926,"Governor Josh Shapiro’s office quietly paid $295,000 earlier this fall to settle a sexual harassment and retaliation claim against Mike Vereb, the governor’s former secretary of legislative affairs. The breakdown: $196,365 went to the complainant and more than $49,000 covered legal fees. The settlement, made public via an open‐records request, also requires the Policy and Legislative Affairs staff to undergo sexual harassment training and allows the employee to seek other state‐government or contractor positions. Vereb has resigned, and the administration—while declining further comment—notes Governor Shapiro met with the state’s women Democratic senators as the allegations emerged. The case highlights broader concerns about workplace culture and respect in government."
13933,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a statement on October 9 condemning recent terrorist attacks on Israel and pledging full support for both Israeli and American citizens there. He has ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to bolster security at synagogues, schools, and other Jewish- or Israel-related sites, warning of possible reprisals by Hezbollah or Hamas against Texas’s Jewish community. Abbott also barred all state agencies from buying or shipping goods to the Gaza Strip if they could benefit Hamas, and allocated $4 million in grants to 31 Jewish organizations to enhance their security. He further directed that the Texas flag be flown at half-staff until Saturday in honor of those killed in the conflict. According to CBS-19, more than 1,600 Israelis, Palestinians and Americans have died so far."
13935,"FEMA will conduct a nationwide test of its Wireless Emergency Alert system on Wednesday, Oct. 4, at 2:20 p.m. EDT (1:20 p.m. CDT, 12:20 p.m. MDT, 11:20 a.m. PDT). Phones will display “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed,” or in Spanish, “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA … No se necesita acción,” accompanied by the familiar 1963 audio tone established under President Kennedy. The test—part of FEMA’s triennial checks (last held Aug. 11, 2021)—ensures the system’s reliability; if needed it can be rescheduled for Oct. 11 due to severe weather or major events. Most users will receive it unless their phone is off, in airplane mode, out of coverage or on an older device. In keeping real alerts distinct, the FCC recently proposed fining FOX for misusing EAS tones in an NFL promo. Source: Newscentermaine.com"
13962,"Reese Moore, a senior guard at Tishomingo County High School, signed her National Letter of Intent with Freed-Hardeman University on October 23, after originally committing on June 25. A dual-sport standout, Moore helped the Lady Braves volleyball team to a 13-8 record and second-round playoff appearance—and is one of the state’s few athletes with both 1,000+ career basketball points and 1,000+ volleyball kills. Now focusing on basketball, the 5’11″ guard averaged 20 points and 8.2 rebounds per game last season, leading TCHS to a 29-3 mark and a 4A state quarterfinals berth; she was also named to the 2023 Mississippi North All-Star Game. Freed-Hardeman’s Lady Lions, coming off a 24-10 season and Mid-South Conference tournament title under coach Joshua Epperson, project Moore as a natural fit. TCHS hosts a jamboree on October 28; its season opener is November 7 at Alcorn Central."

Gavin Newsom, joined by First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom, will spend a week in China advancing climate action, economic development, tourism and cultural exchange ahead of November’s APEC Summit in San Francisco. Emphasizing that California and China—two of the world’s largest economies—must partner on low-carbon transitions, Newsom outlined a packed itinerary in five regions:

• Hong Kong: Fireside chat with Hong Kong University leaders on climate change and economic growth.  
• Guangdong (Shenzhen/Guangzhou): Meetings with regional officials and businesses on converting industrial cities into electric‐vehicle and public‐transit hubs, including China’s shift to an all-electric bus fleet.  
• Beijing: Talks with national and local leaders on methane reduction, clean-energy development, economic ties, cultural exchange and xenophobia; tour of the Great Wall.  
• Jiangsu: Visits to an offshore wind facility and a wetlands preserve to examine China’s drive to become the top wind-power producer and compare California’s own offshore-wind goals.  
• Shanghai: Signing the delegation’s fifth memorandum of understanding with local authorities and touring Tesla’s Shanghai gigafactory."

She’d been off-screen since July, after welcoming her second son, Jake Joseph, and caring for two-year-old Caden. Announcing on Twitter that she’s already shot her first post-leave episode, Egan hinted Chelsea will reappear in Genoa City “in a few more weeks.” Given Y&R’s six-to-eight-week production lead time, viewers can expect Chelsea back by mid to late November. Her return is timed to intersect with Billy’s family drama, Adam’s need for his son Connor, her new job at Marchetti alongside Summer, and developments in her romance with Billy.

His doctor, Colin Colby, warns Eric that the condition is terminal, and Eric’s wife Donna, who’s been hiding his prognosis, urges him to stand down. Eric refuses, insisting on pressing forward with what he calls his “final hurrah,” and fans are teased with the possibility that his unchecked ego could lead to a dramatic collapse on the runway."

This night race—F1’s return to Las Vegas after a 40-year hiatus and the 1 100th round of the World Championship—will run on a newly created 3.8-mile temporary street circuit along the Strip, featuring a two-kilometer straight, 17 corners, three straights and three DRS zones. After more than 30 proposals, the FIA approved a high-speed, counterclockwise 14-turn layout. Teams will employ Monza-Spa low-downforce aero packages, while the night setting promises cooler conditions and a dazzling city-lights backdrop. The 2023 season expands to 23 races, with Las Vegas making its debut."
13495,"Luis Alfredo Jacobo, a Bakersfield-based methamphetamine kingpin, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour to four concurrent life terms plus four years for directing a continuing criminal enterprise, three counts of drug conspiracy, and 21 counts of unlawful use of a communication facility. From 2016 to 2021, Jacobo coordinated meth distribution networks in Oklahoma and Missouri—working with more than a dozen associates in California, Northeast Oklahoma, and Southwest Missouri—using Mexican supply sources to arrange shipments of up to 200 pounds and control pricing, delivery, and payment. Proceeds as large as $100,000 were funneled back to California by co-conspirators or mail. Federal agents uncovered 231 pounds of meth and $465,000 in a 2020 storage-unit bust in Grove, Oklahoma, and arrested codefendant Tony Garcia with 30 pounds of meth and a loaded handgun in Oklahoma City; Garcia’s texts showed direct orders from Jacobo. Jacobo’s conviction followed “Operation Pullin Chains,” a multi-agency Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force effort led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the DEA."
13499,"On October 1, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler—president of EMILY’s List and a Maryland resident—to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the late Senator Dianne Feinstein, who served from 1992 until her death on September 29, 2023. Butler, who will serve until the November 2024 election, is the first Black lesbian to openly sit in the Senate. A Democratic strategist with a background in the labor movement, she has advised Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, led SEIU California, directed public policy and campaigns for Airbnb North America, and been a partner at political consulting firm SCRB Strategies. Butler grew up in Magnolia, Mississippi, attended Jackson State University (an HBCU), has served on the University of California Board of Regents and on the boards of the Children’s Defense Fund and BLACKPAC, and, though currently living in Maryland, owns a California home and will re-register to vote there."
13503,"On October 20–21, 2023, a weak coronal mass ejection (CME) striking Earth produced an unexpectedly vivid Northern Lights display across the Midwest and Northern Plains—from Minnesota and Michigan down to southern Wisconsin and Omaha, Nebraska, with reports also from North Dakota. Because this CME arrived with only modest solar‐wind speeds and lacked the usual rapid spike, most aurora trackers missed it. The only clear indicators were a brief satellite data gap, a slight rise in solar wind, and a negative Bz orientation—signals noted hours in advance by Charlie Bourdo. Bourdo has since released a “how-to” video on forecasting auroras, available via Limitless Media’s social channels."

Last weekend she and Shiver joined her brother, Grayson Chrisley, and his girlfriend for a double date at a Zach Bryan concert, even wearing matching shirts. This is Savannah’s first serious relationship since her on-again, off-again engagement to Nic Kerdiles. As legal guardian of Grayson and their sister/niece Chloe—roles she took on last November before their parents began federal prison sentences—Savannah says it’s important her partner understands her family responsibilities. On Nick Viall’s podcast and while promoting FOX’s Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test, she praised Robert, calling the relationship worth protecting and thanking God for their meeting.

Although RJ plans to wait until after a fashion show to break the news to his grandfather, Luna goes behind his back and informs Ridge that RJ knew of Eric’s condition and kept it secret. Ridge confronts RJ angrily, and RJ feels betrayed by Luna’s intervention. In the fallout, Ridge urges RJ to forgive Luna, insisting she did the right thing by protecting the family. Fans are left wondering whether RJ will indeed forgive Luna and what motivated her to act."
13554,"Summary:

• Cristina Michelle Husbands, 48, of Dallas, Texas, pleaded guilty to a multi-state bank fraud conspiracy that diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks in Mississippi, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas.  
• Between November 2021 and April 2022, she stole at least $108,000 from Regions Bank accounts by using false IDs to withdraw funds in cash and cashier’s checks.  
• Husbands says she was homeless, addicted to drugs, and coerced by recruiters she met at shelters and addiction clinics, who exploited her vulnerability.  
• U.S. District Judge Sul Ozerden sentenced her to 64 months in prison, five years’ supervised release, and $481,140 restitution.  
• Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie prosecuted the case. Husbands apologized to her victims and still faces related charges in other states."
13558,"Texas Democratic Representative Eddie Morales, whose West Texas district includes El Paso, Del Rio and Eagle Pass, told Fox 4’s Steven Dial that President Biden’s recent immigration measures haven’t done enough to help border states as migrant crossings remain near last year’s record of roughly 2.38 million encounters. Morales proposed charging each migrant a $2,000 entry fee in exchange for a non-voting RFID-enabled ID that could also function as a payment card. He argued this fee—at an average of 1,600 daily crossings in the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector—would raise about $3.2 million per day (over $1.2 billion annually) and, paired with formal labor-supply agreements between Texas and Mexican governors for seasonal work, create a “win-win” by ensuring migrants are employed legally and employers are protected from illicit hiring."
13569,"Jag Bains claimed his fifth straight BB25 competition win—three Power of Veto victories and two Head of Household titles—by winning this week’s POV. After running the house as HOH (following Cory Wurtrnberger’s unanimous eviction), he nominated Blue Kim and America Lopez and made Blue his sole target, planning not to use the veto even if he saves a nominee. All houseguests except Cirie Fields competed in POV; Jag emerged victorious again. Blue is scrambling for votes to stay, while Bowie Jane and Matt Klotz want her out. With four confirmed votes against Blue, Jag needs just one more to evict her. Looking ahead, a double eviction looms, and Jag cannot compete for the next HOH—he’ll need Matt to win to keep him safe. Blue’s eviction appears likely, but Jag’s fate hinges on that upcoming HOH outcome."
13577,"Hope Logan rushes to tell her mother, Brooke, that her father Deacon Sharpe is in love with Sheila Carter—a claim Hope deduced after seeing Sheila at his apartment and confirmed by Finn. Stunned, Brooke confronts Deacon, who admits the relationship and insists people can change; she warns he’ll lose everyone unless he ends it. Later, Brooke informs Ridge Forrester, who reveals he’s known about Deacon and Sheila for some time but stayed silent to avoid upsetting Brooke."

• Lionel Richie will continue his “King of Hearts” residency at the Encore Theater in Wynn Las Vegas from June 26 through November 16, 2024, performing his greatest hits and interacting with fans.  
Both performers’ tickets are selling quickly, cementing Las Vegas’s status as a premier live-music destination for 2023 and beyond."
15619,"Late Thursday in the Washington area, a series of linked shootings began with what police believe was a domestic kidnapping. Authorities say the suspect’s vehicle was spotted outside the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters in Suitland, Maryland. When a guard approached, he saw two people arguing and was shot in the upper body; he remains in extremely critical condition. The suspect then fled, firing at multiple locations as police pursued him. The chase ended on Washington’s busy H Street in a crash and subsequent shootout that left both an officer and the suspect wounded; both were conscious when removed from the scene. Police recovered the kidnapping victim unharmed. No names have been released."
15647,"The California Department of Public Health has declared over as of Friday a measles outbreak that sickened 131 people with the B3 strain—and five with a different genotype—since it began among visitors to two Disney theme parks in mid-December. It has been 42 days (two full incubation periods) since the last known B3 case. Vaccination records were obtained for 81 of the B3 cases; 70% were unvaccinated. Dr. Karen Smith credited rapid case investigations, contact interviews, targeted vaccinations and heightened provider awareness for bringing the outbreak to an end. Two rash-bearing patients identified in April had a different measles genotype. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness—transmitted by coughing or sneezing, able to linger in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours—that causes fever, red or sore eyes, runny nose, cough and rash and can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis or death."
15748,"Jill Dillard, the first daughter from the reality show 19 Kids and Counting to marry, has become the family’s first granddaughter to have a child. People magazine reports she and husband Derick welcomed a 9-lb, 10-oz son, Israel David, on Monday—more than a week past his due date. Jill, a student midwife who had given herself two due dates, remained patient as her parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, shared a video of the new family on Facebook. Jill and Derick were married on June 21; in the same Duggar brood, eldest son Josh is already father to three and his wife Anna is expecting their fourth in July."
15777,"Most airline pilots are skilled at compartmentalizing personal stress in the cockpit, and today clinical depression is treatable—with approved medications allowing pilots to fly until recovery. The author examines how Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who had severe psychiatric problems treated with injections, nonetheless passed every hurdle on his path to Airbus A320 first officer. Despite clear “red flags”—his isolation in a glider club, the high-stakes selection for Lufthansa’s ab initio program, untypical leave during training, a disclosed history of depression, and hundreds of hours of close instructor supervision—nobody halted his progress. Germanwings’ lower pay, longer schedules and limited medical benefits likely added stress. The author argues that Lubitz’s case was “an accident waiting to happen” and underscores that rigorous investigation aims to prevent similar tragedies."
15782,"Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Columbus, Ohio, pleaded not guilty to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI. According to the Department of Justice, Mohamud became a citizen in February 2014, applied for a passport days later, and in April 2014 flew to Greece via Istanbul before diverting to Syria to train and fight alongside al-Nusra Front. Prosecutors allege he learned weapons, explosives and combat skills there, expressed eagerness to join his brother—who died fighting for al-Nusra—in death, and plotted execution-style attacks on U.S. soldiers (including at a Texas military base), police officers or prison staff. They further claim a cleric instructed him to return to the U.S. to carry out terrorism. Mohamud was remanded into custody; his lawyer has pledged a vigorous defense."
15784,"Two Tulsa sheriff’s deputies who helped pin Eric Harris to the ground during an April 2 weapons sting have been reassigned amid threats to them and their families, Sheriff Stanley Glanz said. Though not charged, they drew criticism for holding Harris down as he pleaded, “I’m losing my breath,” while officers on video responded, “F*ck your breath.” The sheriff, who offered no detail on their new duties, also announced a temporary suspension of the department’s drug-unit operations pending a review of the shooting. Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, 73, is charged with second-degree manslaughter after firing what he said he believed was a Taser but was actually his handgun. Free on $25,000 bond, Bates has apologized and calls the shooting accidental. The FBI found no civil-rights violations. Allegations that Bates’s training records were forged were denied by Glanz, who says Bates is qualified and plans no training waivers. Harris’s family, noting racial dimensions—Bates is white, Harris black—demands justice and policy reform."
11350,"Carlos Colina, 32, of Massachusetts is charged with murder after human remains were found in Cambridge earlier this week. Authorities say a duffel bag containing body parts was discovered along a walkway on Saturday morning, and surveillance footage led police to an apartment building near the Cambridge Police Department headquarters, where additional remains were recovered. The victim, identified Monday as 26-year-old Jonathan Camilien—who knew Colina—was the same person found at both sites. Colina, who had already been arraigned on separate charges of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body, will be arraigned on the new murder charge on April 14. A judge also revoked his bail in the unrelated assault case. District Attorney Marian Ryan described the case as “a gruesome discovery.” CNN’s Kevin Conlon contributed to this report."
11354,"On a rainy Tuesday in Washington, CNN’s Brian Todd and photojournalist Khalil Abdallah came across a mother duck and her brood crossing busy L Street NW en route to an interview. Restaurant patrons and passersby stopped traffic, used an umbrella to guide the frantic mother, and rescued one duckling that tried to dart back into the street. According to the Washington Post, they eventually escorted the family to a more enclosed grassy area at 16th and L streets NW. Todd called it an “extraordinary” sight—unlike the usual pigeons or squirrels—worthy of national headlines."
11365,"Since Saudi Arabia began leading airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels on March 26, more than 500 Houthi fighters have been killed, a Saudi Defense Ministry official reported. The nine-nation coalition has launched 1,200 airstrikes aimed at preventing rebel advances into southern Yemen. Clashes in the Najran border region on Friday left three Saudi officers dead and two wounded after Houthi mortar fire. According to Yemen’s Health Ministry, 385 civilians have died and 342 been injured; the WHO reports higher totals—648 killed and 2,191 wounded (including militants). Yemen has spiraled into chaos since the Houthis ousted President Hadi in January, and the UN says most of its 25 million people now need humanitarian aid."
11396,"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn of the Diocese of Kansas City–St. Joseph, Missouri, who in 2012 became the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in the church’s sex-abuse scandal. Finn was found guilty of failing to report suspected child abuse tied to a local priest, Shawn Ratigan, and received two years’ probation (no jail time or fine), while related charges against the diocese were dropped. Prosecutors established a counseling fund and mandatory abuse-reporting training as part of the penalty. Critics—including Cardinal Sean O’Malley and Notre Dame professor Candida Moss—had long questioned why Finn remained in office years after his conviction. Archbishop Joseph Naumann has been named apostolic administrator until a permanent bishop is appointed. Watchdog leaders applaud the move but urge Francis to explicitly tie the resignation to a renewed commitment to child-safety and greater bishop accountability."
11416,"Tristan da Cunha, a volcanic archipelago in the South Atlantic with just under 270 residents, claims to be the world’s most isolated inhabited settlement. In partnership with the Royal Institute of British Architects, the UK overseas territory has launched an international design competition to renew its small concrete‐and‐volcanic‐rock homes, public buildings and infrastructure for greater energy efficiency, renewable power use and self-sufficiency ahead of its 200th anniversary in 2016. Entrants—especially those experienced in remote‐region renewables, modern housing and low-cost agriculture—must contend with a single 60-day-a-year shipping window, limited cargo capacity and use of local materials. Tristan da Cunha comprises four islands (only Tristan is inhabited; two nearby and distant Gough are uninhabited, with Gough and Inaccessible Island designated UNESCO World Heritage sites). The main town, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, has basic amenities—a pub, shop, café, museum, church, dance hall, swimming pool—plus two doctors, two nurses and a school of about 30 pupils. The economy depends on lobster fishing exports, sales of stamps, coins and handicrafts, tourism, and homegrown food. Recent upgrades to water, electrical and wastewater systems have begun, but rising living costs and limited transport and communications make reducing fossil-fuel reliance and modernizing government structures priorities. Initial proposals are due mid-June; a longlist of 20 will be trimmed to five by September, with the winner announced June 2016. Funding will be sought from UK and possibly EU grants."
11428,"The passage summarizes four main storylines discussed on CNN’s “Inside Politics” Sunday panel:

1. Obama’s Cuba diplomacy: As President Obama heads to a summit in Panama, the White House is weighing whether to arrange a historic first‐ever face-to-face meeting with Cuban leader Raúl Castro—balancing the potential for progress against accusations of giving the Castros an undeserved reward.

2. Clinton’s campaign launch: Hillary Clinton has leased Brooklyn headquarters and will soon formally launch her presidential bid. Her team plans to reintroduce her via biographical vignettes—her suburban Chicago childhood, work with the Legal Services Corporation and Children’s Defense Fund, and advocacy for education in Arkansas—while showcasing a large, experienced campaign staff through small, personal events.

3. Menendez indictment fallout: Beyond salacious reports of luxury hotel stays, one charge against Senator Robert Menendez alleges his staff solicited funds for a super PAC, a potential campaign‐finance violation. Watchdogs warn that if the FEC probes this issue, other lawmakers could also face scrutiny.

4. GOP operatives choosing sides: By next Monday there will be three official Republican presidential candidates (Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio), and others will soon join. Party operatives are being courted—evidenced by a former Romney aide joining Chris Christie in New Hampshire and pollster Tony Fabrizio ultimately signing with Rand Paul despite overtures from Christie and Scott Walker."
11430,"CNN has named Jake Tapper as the new anchor of its Sunday political interview show, State of the Union, beginning in June. He will continue as CNN’s chief Washington correspondent and as weekday anchor of The Lead. Tapper, praised for his political expertise and interim work on ABC’s This Week in 2010, thanked CEO Jeff Zucker and his CNN colleagues for their support. He succeeds Candy Crowley, who left last December, after a year of rotating fill-in hosts. Zucker lauded Tapper as a relentless reporter and gifted storyteller. The move comes amid similar Sunday-show shake-ups at CBS (Bob Schieffer to John Dickerson) and NBC (David Gregory to Chuck Todd) and could spur viewers to sample new anchors. Tapper joins the small group of journalists who anchor both weekday and Sunday programs, a role also held by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and formerly by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer."
11773,"Oscar-winning rapper-turned-actor Common has joined the cast of Warner Bros.’ upcoming DC super-villain action film Suicide Squad, directed by David Ayer. He joins Jared Leto (the Joker), Will Smith (Deadshot), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and co-stars Joel Kinnaman, Cara Delevingne, Viola David, Adam Beach, Ike Barinholtz, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Scott Eastwood. Rumored cameos include Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor and Ben Affleck’s Batman as Warner builds its cinematic universe. The plot follows imprisoned villains recruited by a government agency for covert operations; Common’s specific role remains under wraps. In production in Toronto, the film marks Common’s latest project following his Oscar-winning song for Selma and his turn in Run All Night; he’ll shoot Hunter Killer in July. He is represented by CAA and Myman Greenspan."
11800,"Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old American aid worker and longtime USAID contractor, was kidnapped in Lahore in 2011 by gunmen posing as neighbors. Al Qaeda later claimed responsibility for his abduction and demanded that the U.S. end airstrikes in Pakistan. Despite calls for his release and hopes raised by other prisoner exchanges, no deal was reached. On January 15, U.S. forces carried out a drone strike against an al Qaeda compound on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, inadvertently killing Weinstein and Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto.  

Weinstein’s wife, Elaine, expressed heartbreak and disappointment that neither the U.S. nor Pakistani governments did more to secure his release, though she thanked Maryland members of Congress and the FBI for their efforts. She noted that U.S. officials have launched an independent investigation into the strike. President Obama and former Ambassador Dan Simpson praised Weinstein’s decades of service—first in the Peace Corps and later as a development specialist who learned Urdu and worked to alleviate poverty in Pakistan. A video released by his captors in 2013 showed Weinstein in deteriorated health, underscoring his family’s long struggle for answers and rescue."
11803,"South Korea’s Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo offered his resignation amid a widening bribery scandal sparked by tycoon Sung Woan-jong’s April 9 suicide, in which Sung left a note alleging cash payments to top officials, including those close to President Park Geun-hye. Lee will remain in office until President Park accepts his resignation and has handed off Cabinet-meeting duties to the deputy prime minister. A special prosecutor’s team is now investigating Lee and seven other politicians linked to Park. Lee has denied the allegations and demanded evidence before stepping down, while President Park—currently in Peru and due back April 27—has called the scandal “regrettable,” condemned corruption, and vowed political reform."
11871,"Corinthian Colleges Inc.’s decision to close its last 28 campuses is seen as a win in the effort to rein in predatory for-profit colleges—institutions that enroll 13% of U.S. students but account for nearly half of all loan defaults. Corinthian once served over 70,000 mostly low-income students, relying on federal loans for 86% of its revenue, yet its graduates often earn less than high-school dropouts and struggle to find work. For-profit career colleges use aggressive recruiting (100 calls a day), low-cost online classes and part-time faculty to maximize federal aid, creating a multibillion-dollar industry whose leaders hire lobbyists and donate to both parties. A series of government reports and state investigations have exposed rule-breaking—from fake diplomas to false job-placement claims—while recent Corinthian alumni have launched a “debt strike,” prompting Education Secretary Arne Duncan to consider forgiving loans for those left unemployed. Advocates now call for shutting down all remaining for-profit colleges and wiping out debts for any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable school within three years, to protect both students and the integrity of the college degree."
11884,"Kabul today is a city transformed by two decades of NATO involvement: its population has quintupled as people flee provincial violence, yet many of the services and opportunities that once drew foreign workers have vanished. English-speaking Afghans who staffed NATO and U.S. projects say they’ve been fired, blacklisted and left homeless—sleeping in market stalls or mosque courtyards and too afraid to see their families. Former “poppy palace” neighborhoods and once-bustling streets like Chicken Street are now largely deserted, and restaurants that catered to contractors sit empty under embassy security advisories.  

Outside the city, vast fleets of excavators, cranes and supply trucks—formerly part of massive military logistics—stand idle, their owners impoverished while top contractors reportedly escaped with their profits. Yet new wedding palaces glow nightly along Kabul’s roads, as families cling to hope or prepare to leave. Throughout the capital, powerful generators—installed at great cost by NATO—keep the lights on for now, even as the last U.S. troops prepare to withdraw into the embassy by next year and Afghans wonder how long the electricity will last."
11885,"A Consumer Reports analysis of 70 million domestic trips over two years compared award‐seat availability on the five largest U.S. airlines. Southwest led the pack with 11.9 million award tickets—11.5% of its 103.1 million seats—thanks to its “Every Seat is an Award Seat” policy, no blackout dates, non-expiring points, no close-in or cancellation fees, and a network spanning 90+ destinations. Delta came second with 5.6 million award seats, United third with 5 million, American fourth with 3.5 million, and JetBlue last with 892,000 one-way awards (4.5% of 19.7 million seats), in part because it serves fewer top markets and its customers fly less frequently (though it has eliminated mile expirations). On average 10% of passengers flew on award tickets, but Consumer Reports cautions that low-fare routes—like LAX–SFO, where cash fares average just over $100—aren’t always a good miles value, recommending more expensive routes such as AA’s New York–San Francisco or Delta’s Chicago–Los Angeles instead. Passenger satisfaction scores mirrored award access: Southwest (86), JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And unlike the other carriers, Southwest charges no fees for bags, phone bookings or changes."
11890,"James Holmes, a then–27-year-old neuroscience doctoral student, carried out one of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings on July 20, 2012, in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater showing “The Dark Knight Rises.” Wearing body armor, a gas mask and red-orange hair like the Joker, he opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding about 70. Arrested immediately afterward, Holmes admits the shootings but pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming a “psychotic episode.” Prosecutors reject that defense and seek the death penalty; opening statements are set to begin soon before a jury of 12 plus 12 alternates on 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder.  

Background  
– Raised in central coastal California, Holmes was an exemplary student: UC Riverside neuroscience graduate with highest honors, then a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Colorado Anschutz, funded by an NIH grant.  
– In early 2012, he expressed violent threats to classmates and was evaluated by a university psychiatrist who warned he might be dangerous; that June he dropped out and lost campus access.  
– In the weeks before the shooting, he amassed four firearms, over 6,000 rounds of ammunition, booby-trapped his apartment and exchanged texts about “dysphoric mania.”  

Trial and Aftermath  
– Jury selection involved 9,000 summonses, with trial expected to last into autumn. DA George Brauchler calls it a “horrible roller coaster” and insists “justice is death.”  
– Victims’ advocates (No Notoriety) urge media to stop giving mass killers publicity.  
– Holmes’s parents—his father a mathematician, his mother a nurse—have asked the court to spare his life and confine him to a psychiatric institution if he’s found legally insane."
11891,"Prosperity gospel pastor Creflo Dollar recently defended his fundraising drive to purchase a $65 million Gulfstream G650 jet by asking for $300 each from 200,000 global supporters. In a five-minute YouTube clip to his World Changers Church International congregation, he blamed “the devil” for trying to “discredit” him over criticisms about his request, his tithing practices, his real name and alleged W-2 screenings at church. Although he insisted, “I never…asked you for a dime for this airplane,” Dollar previously solicited donations in March to replace his 1984 Gulfstream G-1159A after two mechanical incidents—including a runway skid in London with his wife and daughters aboard—that forced him to fly commercial. The now-removed fundraising page is still accepting gifts through the church’s general giving portal. According to Gulfstream, the G650 carries 18 passengers, four crew, two Rolls-Royce engines, high-speed Internet and offers coast-to-coast U.S. range. Attempts to reach Dollar’s ministry for further comment were unsuccessful."
