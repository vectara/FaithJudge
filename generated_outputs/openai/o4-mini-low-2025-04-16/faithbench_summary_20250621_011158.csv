14-0,"Militants from the so-called Islamic State attacked Kabul’s 400-bed Sardar Daud hospital on Monday, detonating explosives at the gate before opening fire on staff and patients. Commandos landed on the roof and, after six hours of fighting, killed all four attackers. More than 50 people were wounded. IS claimed responsibility, while the Taliban denied involvement. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the assault as an attack on “all of Afghanistan,” noting that a hospital is traditionally regarded as an off-limits site. Eyewitnesses reported gunmen in white coats firing on guards, doctors and patients. Analysts say this was IS’s first direct clash with security forces in the capital and marks a shift toward Taliban-style tactics—blowing gates to gain entry—suggesting the group now has greater resources and training. Since declaring its Khorasan Province in 2015, IS has staged high-profile suicide bombings and rallies mainly targeting Shia civilians and government sites but has so far failed to establish a broad foothold beyond eastern bases. Government forces have cleared some IS positions in the east but militants hold mountainous areas. Afghanistan’s leadership vowed to avenge the attack as security forces brace for further assaults."
14-1,"Mukherjee’s The Lives of Others, a 1967 Calcutta family saga, is 5/2 favourite to win the 46th Booker Prize—the first time the award has been open to any author writing in English, regardless of nationality. The six-strong shortlist, unveiled at London’s Guildhall on 9 September, includes three British writers (Howard Jacobson’s dystopian love story J; Ali Smith’s dual-timeline How To Be Both; and Mukherjee), two Americans (Joshua Ferris’s New York dentist mystery To Rise Again at a Decent Hour; Karen Joy Fowler’s family drama We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves) and Australia’s Richard Flanagan (3/1 for his WWII railway romance The Narrow Road to the Deep North). The winner will be announced Tuesday night by the Duchess of Cornwall, with coverage on BBC News Channel and BBC Arts from 21:30 BST.

Synopsis, sales and debate: Fowler leads with over 55,000 copies sold since March (Ferris has sold just over 6,000), and Mukherjee’s title jumped from 97 to 507 weekly sales after the shortlist announcement. Critics like David Brauner have called the list “weak,” praising Jacobson’s J but doubting a repeat win so soon after another double-winner. Chaired by AC Grayling alongside Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner, the panel will award £50,000 to the winner; each shortlisted author receives £2,500 and a specially bound edition. Last year’s prize went to 28-year-old Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries—the youngest winner in the prize’s history."
14-2,"After Brexit, Mark Carney surprised many by choosing neither to quit as planned in 2018 nor to stay until 2021, but to extend his term as Governor of the Bank of England by just one year—to mid-2019. Though observers wondered if politics or gloomy economic forecasts drove him, Carney made it for personal reasons: in 2018 two of his daughters face key exams, and years of weekend summits have kept him away from home. He stressed that his choice was entirely personal, not policy-driven, and enjoyed government support—including from Theresa May, who left the decision to him. By mid-2019, after the Article 50 exit process is complete, a new governor will take the reins."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, a veteran Sunday Times columnist who joined the paper in 1993, died suddenly after a chemotherapy battle with what he called the “full English” of cancers. His final column, on coming to terms with his diagnosis, appears in tomorrow’s edition. Editor Martin Ivens remembered him as “the heart and soul” of the paper, praising his wit, fearlessness and compassion.

Known for dictating copy around his dyslexia, Gill earned admiration and sparked controversy in equal measure. Colleagues and fellow writers—Jay Rayner, Tim Shipman, Stig Abell, John Witherow, Andrew Neil and Piers Morgan—paid tribute to his brilliant, uncompromising style. His provoked debates over pieces describing a Tanzanian baboon hunt, derogatory comments about the Welsh and various British locales, and a 2010 review of Clare Balding censured for homophobic language.

Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill studied at St Christopher’s School, Central Saint Martins and the Slade School of Fine Art. He began writing art reviews in the 1980s before moving to Tatler and then the Sunday Times. He was married three times—first to Cressida Connolly, then to Amber Rudd, with whom he had two children, and was engaged to long-term partner Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins."
14-4,"Three informal “virtual warrior” groups have been active in the Ukraine-Russia conflict:

1. Ukrainian Cyber Troops  
   – Led by Kiev-based Yevhen Dokukin, they present themselves as independent pro-Ukrainian activists.  
   – Hacked Russian interior-ministry servers and a Rostov police email account, passing 35 GB of data to Inform Napalm, which claims the files show wounded Russian servicemen evacuated from Ukraine.  
   – Rely heavily on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to knock out rebel websites and on hijacking CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers (to display pro-Ukrainian slogans or insults to Vladimir Putin).  
   – Target rebel funding by disrupting PayPal and WebMoney accounts.  
   – Ukrainian officials deny using this hacking intel to direct artillery fire, saying they only trust data from known sources.

2. Cyber Berkut  
   – An anti-Western group named after the riot police who cracked down on 2014 Kiev protesters.  
   – Aims to thwart Ukraine’s military efforts, accusing Kiev of “genocide” at U.S. behest.  
   – During Joe Biden’s November visit, hacked Ukrainian government websites to label him “the fascists’ master” and claim they stole U.S. military-assistance documents.  
   – Also hacked Kiev billboards to portray Ukrainian officials as “war criminals,” allegedly tampered with vote-counting systems before Ukraine’s October parliamentary election, leaked defence-ministry data on losses and desertions, blocked President Poroshenko’s site, and circulated an unverified Facebook-chat transcript implying Ukrainian forces shot down MH17.

3. Anonymous International (a.k.a. b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay)  
   – A Russian activist collective known for publishing Kremlin leaks.  
   – It is unclear whether they hack directly or receive documents from insiders.  
   – Primarily focused on Russian domestic affairs but has released Ukraine-related material, including a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine and alleged emails of former FSB colonel Igor Girkin (Strelkov).  
   – Its website is now blocked inside Russia."

15-3,"A major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, published in the American Journal of Public Health, finds that U.S. heavy drinking rose 17.2 percent from 2005 to 2012, driven largely by women. The CDC defines heavy drinking as more than one drink per day for women (two for men) and binge drinking as four (women)/five (men) drinks on a single occasion. Over the decade, women’s binge‐drinking rates climbed more than seven times those of men; in Santa Clara County, Calif., women’s binge rates jumped nearly 36 percent versus 23 percent for men. By 2012, 8 percent of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18 percent binge drinkers. County extremes in 2012 ranged from 6 percent binge drinking in Madison County, Idaho, to 36 percent in Menominee, Wis.; heavy‐drinker rates were lowest (2 percent) in Hancock County, Tenn., and highest (22 percent) in Esmeralda County, Nev. Alcohol contributed to some 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010 and costs over $220 billion annually. Researchers cite changing social norms for women, younger and more affluent drinkers, cheaper alcohol (taxes lagging inflation), increased advertising ($3.45 billion in 2011), and weakened sales restrictions as factors. The analysis drew on 3.7 million adults surveyed through the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System."

16-0,"The passage opens by declaring Mayweather vs. Pacquiao the biggest—and potentially most significant—fight of this century, noting its place as the sixth in a 12-fight series that have defined boxing history. Its ultimate importance will hinge on what unfolds at the MGM Grand.

As an example of those landmark bouts, the author recounts Sugar Ray Leonard’s trilogy with Roberto Durán, which helped inaugurate boxing’s “golden age” at middle weights alongside fighters like Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler. Leonard, fresh off defeating Félix Trinidad for the welterweight crown, lost his first title defense to Durán in Montreal in June 1980 amid a wildly controversial scoring error that turned a majority decision into a unanimous one—a result derided as “a monument to indecision.”

Their November 25, 1980, rematch in New Orleans saw Leonard abandon a slug-fest for superior speed and movement. Frustrated by jabs and feints, Durán famously quit in the eighth round—turning his back and uttering “no mas.” The stunned boxing world saw Durán’s reputation take three years to recover until he reclaimed glory by knocking out Davey Moore in 1983. Leonard would win their 1989 rubber match on points, but he regarded having forced Durán to quit as his proudest achievement."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy, the world number one and 25-year-old Northern Irishman, says it is “unthinkable” that he won’t one day win the Masters and complete golf’s career Grand Slam. He views Augusta National as both the ultimate test—only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have won all four majors—and a course where he could win multiple green jackets.

McIlroy’s most important career lesson came in 2011, when he carried a four-shot lead into the final round at Augusta but shot an 80 and finished 10 shots behind Charley Schwartzel. He credits that collapse with teaching him how to handle pressure, helping him win the US Open by eight shots two months later and then the 2012 PGA Championship, plus both the Open and PGA in 2014.

In six Masters starts he has only one top-10 (joint eighth in 2014) and was even outscored by his marker in one round, yet he insists he cannot imagine ending his career without a green jacket. If he fails again this year, he’ll regard it simply as “not the right time,” but remains determined to focus on playing his best golf rather than the hype. He also hopes Augusta will serve as a “sanctuary” from the media frenzy surrounding his personal life, which last year included calling off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki and settling a costly management dispute."

16-4,"A three-bedroom, 1,990 sq ft maisonette on exclusive Egerton Place in Knightsbridge is on the market for £575,000—around the annual cost of renting it—because it has only three years left on its lease. The unmodernised flat (three bedrooms, two bathrooms, reception room, utility room, lift access, parking and communal garden) is one of two similar short-lease properties being sold by Russell Simpson (the other is £595,000 for 2,500 sq ft). By contrast, the nearest three-bedroom sale in Knightsbridge starts at £1.5 million with a 28-year lease. Agents say that extending the lease to around 90 years (negotiated with the freeholder, the Wellcome Trust) would cost an estimated £3.35–4.5 million—and, once modernised, the smaller flat could then be worth about £6 million (the larger about £7.5 million). Built circa 1893 by John Grover & Son to Mervyn Macartney’s designs in red and orange brick, Egerton Place homes boast four main storeys plus basements and garrets. Estate agents describe the sale as a “once in a blue moon” chance, though some warn buyers of the “massive premium” required to extend such a short lease."

Separately, West Ham have announced that season tickets for their move to the 54,000-seat Olympic Stadium in 2016–17 will start at £289—the cheapest in the Premier League—to help fill the ground."
8-4,"Mr Mole, ridden by AP McCoy, is one of three 7-2 co-favourites in Saturday’s seven-runner Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown. Trained by Paul Nicholls, he is bracketed with Ireland’s Special Tiara and Nicky Henderson’s Sprinter Sacre, who will be ridden by Nico de Boinville in Barry Geraghty’s absence. This contest will be McCoy’s final ride in a Grade One race; his full book of mounts for retirement day will be confirmed Friday morning. Ironically, McCoy announced his intention to quit after riding Mr Mole to victory at Newbury in February. Other runners include Mick Channon’s Somersby."
11-1,"At 75, Jack Nicklaus aced the 130-yard fourth hole during the Augusta National par-3 contest—his first hole-in-one at the venue—sparking cheers from Gary Player, Ben Crenshaw and the crowd. Five aces in all tied the contest record, with Camilo Villegas contributing two but ultimately losing the playoff to Kevin Streelman. Nicklaus, youngest Masters champion in 1963 and six-time green-jacket winner (last in 1986), remains one of just five men to complete golf’s career Grand Slam."
11-3,"Scientists in Western Australia have confirmed the carcass of a 5.68 m juvenile female Omura’s whale—previously feared extinct—washed up on a remote Exmouth beach after Cyclone Olwyn. This marks the species’ first sighting in WA and only its second in Australia; DNA profiling by the Department of Parks and Wildlife resolved initial identification difficulties. Described only in 2003 and known from tropical and subtropical waters (Indonesia, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan), Omura’s whales have a sleek body and distinctive skeletal traits, including numerous vertebrae and four digits per pectoral fin. Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the find “highly significant,” noting it will aid field identification, clarify regional distribution and, once the buried carcass’s skeleton is exhumed in a few years, support further research and potential museum display."
11-4,"An Omura’s whale—once thought possibly extinct and only formally described in 2003—washed up after Cyclone Olwyn on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia. The 5.68 m juvenile female represents the first WA sighting and just the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff initially struggled to identify the rare species but confirmed it by DNA profiling. Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the find “highly significant,” since so little is known about this tropical–subtropical whale, normally seen in Indonesian waters, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. Omura’s whales have a sleek body and distinctive skeletal traits—more than fifty vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried, and the skeleton will be exhumed in a few years for further study and potential museum display."

10-0,"• In Moscow on Friday, investigators opened the Su-24’s “black box” before journalists and diplomats; head investigator Nikolai Primak reported that some flight data were missing.  
• Analysis of the remaining data—due next week—could clarify whether the jet was in Turkish or Syrian airspace when it was shot down.  
• On 24 November, Turkish F-16s downed the Russian Su-24 supporting Assad in Syria. Both crew ejected; the navigator survived but the pilot was killed—apparently by militants on the ground.  
• A Russian marine sent to rescue the crew also died, and a rescue helicopter was destroyed.  
• Turkey claims the jet ignored repeated airspace warnings; Russia insists it was over Syria. President Putin has accused Turkey of US subservience and “creeping Islamisation.”  
• The incident has sparked a diplomatic crisis: Russia has demanded a Turkish apology and imposed sanctions, including banning package holidays—a move that could cost Turkey billions."
10-2,"Six people were injured when an oil leak triggered an explosion and fire Monday night at a paraxylene (PX) plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian province. Five of the injured suffered cuts from broken glass and were hospitalized; no toxic chemical release has been reported. More than 600 firefighters brought the blaze under control by Tuesday morning. Residents nearby posted photos and reported feeling tremors on social media. The Zhangzhou facility, relocated in 2007 from Xiamen after pollution protests, previously experienced a non-fatal blast in July 2013."
10-3,"A 15-year-old girl met David Ayrton at a Portsmouth garage in autumn 2004; Ayrton, now 34 and living as Davina, was tried at Portsmouth Crown Court for raping her while two friends slept. She denied the charge and will be sentenced on 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her to custody—likely in a male prison in Winchester—citing risks of self-harm and non-attendance. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, changed her name in 2012, spoke in court about her sexuality and lack of medical transition, and had reported the attack to a care-home worker in 2014."
10-4,"Eugene, Oregon, has been awarded the 2021 IAAF World Championships after the IAAF Council—citing a “unique strategic opportunity” to host the event in the U.S. for the first time—waived its usual bidding process. Eugene had previously lost its 2019 bid to Doha, Qatar (home of the Aspire Dome), but a recent presentation convinced the IAAF of the city’s capabilities. IAAF President Lamine Diack praised the partnership of public authorities, the private sector, the US Olympic Committee, NBC and local fans. This marks the second time (after Osaka 2007) that the championships were awarded without bids. Separately, Mo Farah won the men’s 10,000 m gold at the 2016 IAAF World Championships in Moscow."
13-0,"Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson, who was seriously injured by a 2006 bomb in Afghanistan, carried the Olympic torch on 26 June, walking nearly half an hour with an assistant supporting his arm. His official nomination notes that, although the injury robbed him of speech at first, his personality, intelligence and sense of humor remain intact and he now speaks unaided. He spends 12 hours a day on gym work and rehabilitation, walks with crutches, and raises money for military charities as patron of the Pilgrim Bandits.  
Since the relay appearance, he’s received over 5,000 Facebook friend requests—Facebook’s personal-page limit—along with thousands of emails, messages and site visits. His mother, Diane, described the response as “phenomenal,” saying Ben is “bouncing, buoyed up and elated.” Facebook recommends that high-request users switch to a public page or enable subscriptions. In total, 8,000 people will carry the flame on its 8,000-mile, 70-day journey to the London opening ceremony on 27 July."
13-1,"In tomorrow’s episode of Poldark, Demelza Poldark (Eleanor Tomlinson) suddenly goes from eight months pregnant to giving birth within minutes, prompting viewers to question the off-screen time jump. Ross Poldark (Aidan Turner) declares his love for his new daughter’s mother, making it clear his heart is no longer available to the many fans who’ve longed for him. Social-media users pointed out that this rapid pregnancy and birth echo a similar, equally abrupt storyline when Elizabeth carried to term between two episodes—Twitter commenters quipped that in Poldark’s world, “expect to have it in the next 10 minutes.”"
13-2,"Last year in England, 272 children disabled by fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were hospitalized after being born brain-damaged from alcohol exposure in the womb, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. Experts warn the true total may be much higher. World Health Organization research cited by the Sunday People estimates that at least one in 100 UK babies—around 7,500 annually—could suffer learning, behavioral or physical defects (including deformed limbs) due to prenatal alcohol. Elizabeth Mitchell of the National Organisation for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome calls FAS “terribly sad and vastly under-diagnosed,” noting that affected children do not improve.  
A 15-year-old FAS patient, Niamh Brown, requires lifelong help with basic tasks, has no sense of danger and cannot live independently. Her adoptive parents founded the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust in 2007. Other pregnancy-related risks include liver, kidney and heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss and epilepsy. Current UK guidance advises pregnant women to avoid alcohol, or—if they do drink—limit themselves to two units no more than twice a week; Mitchell argues for a zero-alcohol recommendation throughout pregnancy."
13-3,"Scotland’s women’s team have won all five Euro qualifiers to date and face Iceland at Falkirk Stadium, knowing a win would virtually clinch their finals place. Forward Evans, determined to avoid another play-off heartbreak after failures in Euro 2013 and last year’s World Cup qualifiers, stressed the stakes of Friday’s match and the September return in Reykjavik, which will likely decide the group winner. Both teams are unbeaten—Scotland 5-0, Iceland 4-0—and with the best six runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are well placed. Evans, 24, plays for Bayern Munich—where she just won the Frauen-Bundesliga—and is one of 12 squad members based outside Scotland (five in England, four in Sweden, two with Seattle Reign, including BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year Kim Little). She recalls celebrating with Bayern’s men’s team and believes regular competition in top leagues, especially Germany’s, raises individual and national standards, complementing the improving domestic Scottish league."
13-4,"A light general aviation Aerostar aircraft approaching Aero Acres residential airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida, touched down at speed without its landing gear and skidded along the runway on its belly. Video shows its propellers striking the tarmac and wings bouncing before the pilot re-engaged the engines and managed a high-angle take-off despite damaged props. According to WPBF 25 News, 85-year-old pilot Chris Georgaklis—flying for nearly 50 years and accompanied by his dog Buddy—then flew 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and landed safely. The FAA is investigating the incident, which most often results from human error, though mechanical faults can also cause gear-up landings."

12-0,"A rarely seen Omura’s whale washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn, marking the species’ first sighting in WA and only its second in Australia. The 5.68 m juvenile female was hard to identify by sight, but DNA profiling by Department of Parks and Wildlife staff confirmed it as an Omura’s whale. Described only in 2003 and restricted to tropical and subtropical waters—primarily around Indonesia, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan—Omura’s whales have a sleek body and distinctive skeletal features (around 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin). Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the discovery “highly significant,” noting it will aid development of field identification guides and a better understanding of the whale’s regional distribution. The carcass has been buried, and the skeleton will be exhumed in a few years for further scientific study and possible museum display."
12-1,"Conor McGregor, a 26-year-old Irish fighter, is set to challenge featherweight champion José Aldo on July 11 in Las Vegas. Ahead of the bout, McGregor revealed a new stomach tattoo of a tiger (complementing his chest gorilla ink), posting on Instagram: “if you see the tiger, it’s too late. you’re food.” He’s also publicly questioned Aldo’s motivation—claiming Aldo “doesn’t want the belt in his presence”—and in March grabbed Aldo’s title belt during a Dublin promotional event before 5,000 home fans. Aldo will make his eighth title defense; McGregor asserts he is far more driven to win."
12-3,"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck at 15:48 local time at a depth of 15.5 km, with its epicenter in Garfagnana, 35 km north of Lucca. The tremor and its aftershocks were felt as far away as Milan, Florence, Bologna and Modena; phone lines and power were cut in Garfagnana, schools were evacuated for safety checks, and Lucca residents poured into the streets, but no injuries or damage were immediately reported. Italy—prone to seismic activity—suffered nearly 300 deaths in the 2009 L’Aquila quake, and last May two shocks in the same region killed over 20 people. Authorities noted the latest event was a “medium-strong, fairly shallow” quake typical for the area, and Italy continues to grapple with the aftermath of L’Aquila, where six experts were convicted in 2012 for wrongly assuring residents that a major tremor was unlikely."
12-4,"Bobbi Kristina Brown, 22, daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, has been diagnosed with “global and irreversible brain damage,” her grandmother Cissy Houston said after visiting her. Although she’s no longer in a medically induced coma, Brown remains unresponsive—she does not react to people or follow movement with her eyes—and has had a tracheostomy for nearly three months. Two days earlier, her father, Bobby Brown, emotionally told a concert audience she was “awake” and watching him. Family attorney Christopher Brown added that while doctors expect her to live a long time, she’s just beginning a lengthy rehabilitation and her future quality of life is uncertain. Bobby Brown’s wife, Alicia Etheredge-Brown, noted Brown has left the ICU, opened her eyes and started the “long and hard” rehab process."
