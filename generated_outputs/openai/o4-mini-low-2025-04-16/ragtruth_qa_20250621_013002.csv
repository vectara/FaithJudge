• Straight hourly wages  
• Commission on the work they perform  
• Flat-rate or “flag-rate” pay (a set amount per job)

The exact mix—and any entitlement to overtime—depends on their employer (dealer vs. independent shop), pay plan, total earnings and the state in which they work."
14323,"Here’s how to grill a porterhouse using only the steps given:

1. Set up your heat zones.  
   - Charcoal grill: Dump a chimney of lit coals into the grill. With a garden or grill hoe, spread them in a double layer at the far side, a single layer in the center and leave the side nearest you coal-free.  
   - Gas grill: Arrange burners for three-zone grilling (high, medium, low).  

2. Replace the grill grate. When it’s hot, clean it with a grill brush and then lubricate it (for example, with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil).

3. Grill your porterhouse. Its distinctive T-shaped bone imparts extra flavor as you cook—you’ll get a strip steak on one side of the bone and a filet on the other."

5. Lay the gusset lining piece on top of that seam, right side down, and stitch on the same seam line.  
6. Flip the lining down beneath the main gusset and top-stitch near the seam to enclose it.  
7. Repeat steps 3–6 on the other side of the zipper. The finished gusset opening between the two gusset pieces should measure ½″.  
8. Change back to a regular presser foot and edgestitch around the gusset’s seam allowance to join main and lining neatly. Clip any curves for smooth turning.

15529,"Salary exchange (also called salary sacrifice) is a way of making pension contributions by agreeing to give up part of your salary or bonus in return for your employer paying that amount into your pension instead.  Because your cash salary is reduced, both you and your employer pay lower National Insurance contributions.  In practice the amount you “sacrifice” equals your regular pension contribution (for example, 7.5% of pay for USS members or 9% for USPAS members), and your employer pays that same amount into the pension scheme on your behalf."

• Genetic inheritance – oily skin is largely hereditary.  
• Hormonal shifts – fluctuations (e.g. during puberty or menstrual cycles) can increase oil production.

Diet (including “greasy” foods, chocolate, peanut butter or alcohol) plays little to no role in causing oily skin."

2. 50-50 draw – tickets are sold throughout a single‐day event; all sales form a pool, 50 % goes to the randomly drawn winner near the event’s end, and 50 % is reserved for a charity.  
3. Cash tip‐board raffles – sold separately from an event’s admission (which may include dinner and drinks), these allow additional chances to win cash prizes (for example, $10,000)."

12331,"Here’s a concise summary of the diets described and their stated benefits:  
1. TLC Diet  
   – Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish and lean meats for overall healthy eating.  
2. Flexitarian Diet  
   – A vegetarian-friendly variant of the TLC approach that swaps meat for tofu, beans, lentils, peas, nuts and eggs.  
3. SlimFast Diet  
   – A grab-and-go plan using ready-made shakes, bars and one 500-calorie meal daily to promote a 1–2 lb weight loss per week.  
4. Alkaline Diet  
   – Involves avoiding “acidic” foods (grains, dairy, meat, sugar, alcohol, caffeine, fungi).  
5. Blood Type Diet  
   – Bases food choices on an individual’s blood type."
12340,"1. Always brush. Failing to brush with braces leads to cavities, staining and other dental problems.  
2. Use your regular toothbrush to clean each bracketed tooth by brushing:  
   • Downward strokes from the top of the bracket,  
   • Upward strokes from the bottom of the bracket.  
3. Clean between wires and teeth with a proxabrush (Christmas-tree brush):  
   • Insert it from above the wire, brush down;  
   • Insert it from below the wire, brush up;  
   • Repeat several strokes in each direction for every gap.  
4. Floss daily by feeding the short end of dental floss between the arch wire and the tooth near the gum, then use a gentle sawing motion to clean each side of the two adjacent teeth."
12354,"1. Timing and site  
- Wait to plant until soil temperature reaches about 60 °F and all danger of spring frost has passed (often a bit after you’d put tomatoes in).  
- Choose a spot in full sun.

2. Soil preparation  
- Dahlias prefer a sandy, well-drained, slightly acidic soil (pH 6.2–6.5).  
- If your soil is heavy or clay, mix in sand and peat moss to lighten it.

3. Planting  
- Plant dahlia tubers (bulb-like) in spring at your prepared site.  
- Space and depth as you would other perennials.

4. Care  
- Water established plants thoroughly once a week.  
- To encourage large blooms, pinch out all side buds at the end of each branch during the season.

5. Overwintering (storage)  
- Lift tubers after frost, place in pots or boxes in a cool (but not freezing), dry spot (garage is fine).  
- Cover with a blanket or tarp if temperatures drop too low, and keep soil just moist to prevent shriveling."
12357,"The Industrial Revolution transformed society by shifting it from a mainly agricultural economy to one dominated by industry and manufacturing; it introduced machines for laborious work, expanded the use of mineral resources, and—especially in its later phase—enabled mass production of steel, railroads, electricity and chemicals, while driving massive urbanization as people moved from the countryside into growing cities."
12362,"Here’s a concise “getting started” guide based solely on the three passages:

1. Learn the core beliefs  
   • Acknowledge the Flying Spaghetti Monster as your “great noodly god.”  
   • Instead of “amen,” say “RAmen.”

2. Study the sacred texts  
   • Begin with the Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

3. Adopt the look and lingo  
   • Talk and dress like a Pastafarian at every opportunity—especially if you’re “preaching.”

4. Observe Pastafarian holy days  
   • Every Friday (your Sabbath)  
   • Talk Like a Pirate Day (September 19)

5. When you pray, end with “RAmen.”

12374,"Benefits of broccoli include:  
• Nervous system and brain support – high in potassium for healthy nerves, brain function, and muscle growth.  
• Blood pressure regulation – provides potassium, magnesium, and calcium.  
• Immune and antioxidant support – one cup delivers the RDA of vitamin C; rich in indole-3-carbinol.  
• Nutrient density – supplies vitamins A and C, folic acid, fiber, and calcium.  
• Cancer prevention – contains glucoraphanin (a precursor to anti-carcinogenic compounds) and other anti-carcinogens that may hinder prostate, cervical, and breast cancer and support liver health."
12383,"Here’s a consolidated, step‐by‐step way to cook Sinigang na Baboy using only the methods shown in the passages:

1. Prepare the sour broth  
   • Boil sampalok (tamarind) in water until the shells crack. Cool, peel, then mash the pulp off the seeds and strain into a bowl.

2. Build the base  
   • In a pot, sauté garlic and onion.  
   • Add chopped tomatoes and simmer for 5 minutes.

3. Cook the pork  
   • Add bite-sized pork pieces and fish sauce (or more sinigang mix). Cover and let simmer.  
   • After a few minutes, skim off any scum.  

4. Simmer the broth  
   • Pour in your tamarind broth (or seasoned water). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer:  
     – If using fresh tamarind: simmer ~15 minutes.  
     – If using sinigang mix: simmer ~10 minutes.

5. Add root vegetables  
   • Add diced gabi (taro) and simmer until tender (another 15 minutes).  
   • Add sliced horseradish (labanos) and simmer 10 minutes.

6. Add other veggies in order  
   • Eggplant: cook 10 more minutes.  
   • String beans (sitaw): add and boil 2–5 minutes.  
   • Water spinach (kangkong): add last and cook 2–3 minutes.  

7. Final seasonings & serve  
   • Taste and adjust with salt or fish sauce if needed.  
   • Serve hot with steamed rice."
12388,"1. Boil whole milk and refrigerate it.  
2. After a few hours, skim off the cream and collect it in a bowl over a week or two.  
3. Churn the collected cream in a mixer with ice and water until it turns into butter.  
4. Place the butter, uncovered, in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.  
5. Once the butter melts, reduce to medium-low and let it separate into three layers: foam on top, clear ghee in the middle, and milk solids on the bottom.  
6. Skim off all the foam, turn off the heat, and let the pan sit for a minute.  
7. Carefully pour the golden middle layer through a fine strainer into a clean glass jar, leaving the milk solids behind."
