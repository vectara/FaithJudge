14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades attacked Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul by detonating explosives at the gate and opening fire on staff and patients, wounding over 50 people. Afghan commandos killed all four attackers after several hours. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility, while the Taliban denied involvement. This marks the first time IS has directly engaged security forces in Kabul, previously targeting mainly civilian gatherings. The attack suggests IS now has greater resources and military training, potentially leading to more such assaults. IS has been active in Afghanistan since 2015, carrying out several deadly attacks, while the Taliban also continues its own attacks. Afghan leaders condemned the hospital attack, calling it an affront to human values."

14-2,"Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by choosing to extend his term by only one year, rather than staying until 2021 or leaving in 2018 as originally planned. This decision came amid Brexit negotiations and speculation about political or professional pressures. However, Carney emphasized that his choice was based on personal reasons, particularly his family's needs, as his daughters would be finishing school in 2018 and the family wished to return to Canada. He dismissed any suggestions of political tension or influence, stating the decision was entirely personal. Carney will now remain until 2019, after which a new Governor will take over as the Brexit process concludes."

15-3,"A major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington found that heavy drinking among Americans rose 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, mainly due to increased rates among women as social norms change. Binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men over the decade. In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers, though the overall percentage of people who drink alcohol remained stable. The study, the first to track adult drinking at the county level, found significant regional differences. Factors contributing to increased drinking include changing social norms, greater alcohol affordability, increased advertising, weakened alcohol control policies, and demographic shifts such as more affluent young professionals in certain areas. Excessive drinking is linked to about 88,600 U.S. deaths annually and costs over $220 billion per year."

16-4,"A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, one of Britain's most expensive areas, is on the market for £575,000—far below neighboring property prices—because it has only three years left on its lease. The annual cost equates to £191,000, similar to local rental rates, and the flat requires significant renovation. If the lease is extended, the property could be worth over £6 million, but extending the lease for 90 years is estimated to cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million. Another, larger maisonette in the same area is listed for £595,000, also with three years left. Such short-lease properties rarely come up for sale, and while the price appears low, experts warn of the high premium required for lease extension. The properties are attracting interest from locals, developers, and end users."

Over 600 firefighters responded, and local residents reported hearing the explosion. The plant previously experienced an explosion in 2013 without casualties or toxic leaks.

Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, has not undergone physical gender transition. She changed her name in 2012 and disclosed the attack to a care home worker in 2014. Protocols are in place for her detention."

The decision was supported by collaboration among public authorities, the private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and the public. The IAAF president emphasized the importance of accessing the US market for the sport's global development.

FAS is a lifelong, under-diagnosed condition, as illustrated by the case of 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who requires ongoing support. Other health issues linked to alcohol in pregnancy include organ problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. While current government advice allows limited drinking during pregnancy, some experts advocate for complete abstinence."

Forward Evans, reflecting on past play-off disappointments, emphasizes the emotional importance of qualifying and notes that both teams are strong, with Iceland ranked just above Scotland. The Scottish squad includes many players based abroad, which Evans believes strengthens the team.
