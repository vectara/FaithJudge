14-0,"Four militants armed with guns and grenades attacked the 400-bed Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul after detonating explosives at its gate, opening fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the hospital roof engaged the attackers in several hours of fighting and eventually killed all four, while more than 50 people were wounded. The so-called Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, marking a change in its tactics by directly engaging with security forces—a tactic more commonly associated with the Taliban—though the Taliban denied involvement. Afghan leaders, including President Ashraf Ghani and Deputy Leader Abdullah Abdullah, strongly condemned the assault, highlighting its broader implications for Afghanistan's security and values."

14-2,"Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, announced he would extend his term by just one year beyond his original planned exit in 2018. Although many expected either a full extension until 2021 or no extension at all, he chose this ""third way"" primarily for personal reasons—specifically, to be present for his daughters’ important school milestones—while also considering the challenges of leaving amid ongoing Brexit negotiations. He emphasized that his decision was entirely personal and not influenced by government pressure or concerns over economic forecasts."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, the renowned and controversial Sunday Times columnist, died suddenly after battling multiple cancers—a condition he once described as the ""full English"" of cancers. Known for his fearless writing, sharp wit, and distinctive style despite overcoming dyslexia, Gill had long been a major figure at the paper since joining in 1993. Colleagues and former editors praised his intelligence, compassion, and dazzling prose, even as some of his provocative remarks, such as disparaging comments about various groups and places, stirred controversy. In his personal life, Gill was married twice—first to Cressida Connolly and then to Amber Rudd, with whom he had children—and was recently engaged to Nicola Formby, his partner of 23 years. His final column, reflecting on his terminal diagnosis, was set to appear in the Sunday Times."
14-4,"The passage describes several hacker groups active in the Ukraine conflict. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Yevhen Dokukin, carry out high-profile attacks such as hacking Russian ministry servers, disrupting rebel websites with DDoS attacks, hijacking CCTV cameras and network printers to spread pro-Ukrainian messages, and targeting electronic payment accounts linked to separatists. Their activities have even provided data reportedly confirming that wounded Russian servicemen were evacuated to Russia, although Ukrainian security officials deny using hacker information for military operations. In contrast, the pro-Russian Cyber Berkut, known for its anti-Western rhetoric, has hacked Ukrainian government websites—posting messages against figures such as US Vice-President Joe Biden—as well as electronic billboards and vote-counting systems, and leaked information intended to damage Ukrainian leadership. Another group, Anonymous International (also known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay), gained notoriety for publishing leaked Kremlin documents and sometimes focuses on Russian domestic issues while also touching on the Ukraine situation."

15-3,"The study found that heavy drinking and binge drinking in the United States increased significantly between 2005 and 2012, with a 17.2% rise in heavy drinking largely driven by women. Binge drinking among women increased at a much faster rate than among men, with notable regional differences—for example, Santa Clara County saw a nearly 36% rise in women’s binge drinking. In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. The analysis, based on data from about 3.7 million adults via a CDC telephone survey, also pointed to cultural and economic factors such as changing social norms, increased advertising, lower real prices due to tax policies, and weakened alcohol control measures as contributing to the trend, which is linked to substantial public health and economic costs."
4-0,"In the game, the Giants, led by player-coach Derrick Walser’s short-handed opener, took an early lead before Jeff Dimmen helped the Panthers equalize. In the second period, Mike Forney scored a powerplay breakaway goal for the Giants, then Andy Bohmback tied the score. The Giants later pulled ahead with goals from Mike Radja and James Desmarais, making it 4–2, though Nottingham’s David Ling scored a goal for a Panthers response.

Meanwhile, striker Keating, 21, recommended to Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams, has previous experience with Sligo Rovers, Galway United, and Finn Harps, and his transfer is pending international clearance. Nicholson also highlighted the leadership qualities of 27-year-old Myles and the promising hunger of young Ruairi, while noting that the Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, having won only one of their last six games."
9-0,"The passage describes two historical figures named Francis I. The first was a Holy Roman Emperor and Grand Duke of Tuscany (1708–1765) whose wife actually held the real power in his positions. The second was the first King of France from the Angoulême branch of the House of Valois (1494–1547), known by several nicknames—including “François au Grand Nez” and “the Knight-King”—for his notable appearance and personal involvement in wars against his rival, Charles V.

Additionally, many cars struggled with traction due to prolonged rain, and Dracone, a 19-year-old from Italy, did not finish the race, ultimately placing 23rd."
9-2,"Widnes took a commanding lead against Castleford with early tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van, and Chris Bridge to lead 14–6 at half-time. In the second half, although Castleford loanee Paddy Flynn scored twice (including an early try and a hat-trick later) against his parent club, Widnes extended their advantage with additional scores from Ah Van, Lloyd White (two tries), and Joe Mellor. A late surge by Castleford—with three tries in four minutes including one from newly signed Larne Patrick—briefly tightened the contest, but Widnes held on to win. The result marked Castleford’s fourth consecutive home league defeat; as a consequence, Widnes moved above Wakefield into seventh place, while Castleford remained sixth, one point ahead of the Vikings."
9-3,"The passage reports that 30‐year‐old Clarkson rejoined Premiership Well in July for his second spell and is set to potentially debut for St Mirren in the Championship against Alloa on Saturday. Last season at Dundee, he scored nine goals, although he has mostly come off the bench this term. Clarkson emphasized his excellent fitness and readiness, noting that he has been playing regularly—whether in games or for the U20s—to keep his match fitness high. With nearly 400 senior club appearances, along with previous stints at clubs such as Bristol City, Brentford, and Bristol Rovers, and having been capped twice for Scotland in 2008 (scoring one international goal), he is eager to help improve the team's standing as they look to move up the table."

16-0,"The passage begins by highlighting that a Mayweather versus Pacquiao fight is expected to be the most financially significant and historically important boxing match of the century, with its true legacy to be determined by the event's outcome. It then recounts the historical significance of Sugar Ray Leonard’s trilogy with Roberto Durán, focusing on their highly impactful bouts. Key moments include controversial scoring in their first encounter and the dramatic rematch where Durán infamously quit—declaring “no mas”—an act that stunned fans and temporarily damaged Durán’s reputation in Panama. Ultimately, Leonard regarded forcing Durán to quit as his most notable achievement of the series."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy is determined to win the Masters at Augusta National to complete a career grand slam, a goal he considers essential for a complete golfing career. He recalls his 2011 final-round collapse at Augusta as a pivotal learning experience that has helped shape his game. McIlroy aspires to join an elite group—only five players have won all four majors—and sees Augusta as a course where he can excel repeatedly. Despite personal challenges such as calling off his wedding and a costly legal dispute, he remains confident in his ability to overcome the pressure and win his first green jacket."

16-3,"Pablo Mandado (27, Spanish) and Ilze Zebolde (31, Latvian), who met in Riga in 2011, left their restaurant jobs in Manchester to pursue their dream of exploring the world by bicycle. In just 356 days, they have cycled nearly 7,000 miles through 16 countries, living on under three euros a day by camping, using free hosting platforms, and keeping food costs minimal. They rely on simple meals, sometimes foraging or accepting meals from generous strangers, and document their journey on their blog. Their route has taken them from London through various parts of Europe—including France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Slovenia, and the Balkans—and they are now crossing from Europe into Asia with plans to eventually pedal across the Americas."
16-4,"A three-bedroom, 1,990 sq/ft apartment in Knightsbridge is on the market for £575,000. The property, a bright yet unmodernised maisonette with two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift, parking, and a communal garden, has only three years remaining on its lease. This short lease means the effective cost is about £191,000 per year (£15,000 per month), similar to local rental rates, and any buyer wishing to extend the lease could face a premium of millions, potentially raising the property’s value above £6 million. The apartment is one of two maisonettes on Egerton Place, with another on the market for £595,000, and local experts warn buyers to carefully consider the cost of a lease extension."
6-0,"British Paralympian Storey won a race in Nottwil, Switzerland, finishing over two minutes ahead of Poland's Anna Harkowska.

6-3,"Paul Sheerin, a 39‐year-old former Dons midfielder who has served as player-manager at Arbroath (the Red Lichties) since 2010, has been chosen by Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes to replace Neil Cooper at Pittodrie following a comprehensive selection process. Despite Arbroath chairman John Christison’s wish to retain him and accommodate his desire to return to Aberdeen, Sheerin’s appointment went ahead. His career includes playing for several Scottish clubs and a stint in Sweden with Östersunds, earning a Scotland Under-21 cap in the mid-1990s, and notably guiding Arbroath to their first national trophy by winning the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011. The move comes after Arbroath were relegated to Scottish League Two following the 2013–14 season."
6-4,"Rage Against the Machine broke up when tensions led vocalist de la Rocha to leave, prompting him to pursue a solo career. The remaining members then formed Audioslave with Chris Cornell, releasing three albums before their own breakup in 2007.

8-1,"West Ham are close to signing 17-year-old Jamaican forward Deshane Beckford after he impressed during a two-week trial with their academy. Beckford, considered one of the hottest prospects from the Caribbean and linked with various European clubs, including teams in Belgium, has been attracting interest after his training stint. Additionally, West Ham announced season tickets at their Olympic Stadium will be offered for as low as £289 in a bid to fill the 54,000-capacity venue for the 2016-20 season."
8-2,"West Ham are in advanced talks to sign Jamaican forward Deshane Beckford, a 17-year-old from Montego Bay United, who impressed during a two-week trial with the club's academy. Beckford, considered one of the promising Caribbean talents and already attracting interest from European clubs, including teams in Belgium, has been widely linked with a move abroad. Additionally, West Ham announced that season tickets at their new Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 season will start at just £289, offering the most affordable pricing in the Barclays Premier League in an effort to fill the 54,000-capacity stadium."

8-4,"The passage notes that Mr Mole, a Paul Nicholls-trained horse ridden by AP McCoy, is one of three 7-2 co-favourites in the seven-runner Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday. He is grouped with Irish Raider Special Tiara and Nicky Henderson’s sprinter Sacre—the latter to be ridden by Nico de Boinville due to Barry Geraghty’s injury. This race marks McCoy’s final Grade One ride on his last day as a professional jockey, with his final book of rides to be confirmed on Friday morning. The passage also recalls that McCoy announced his retirement after riding Mr Mole to victory at Newbury in February, and mentions another runner, Mick Channon’s Somersby."
11-1,"Jack Nicklaus, at 75 years old, hit a hole in one on the 130-yard fourth hole during Augusta National’s par-3 contest, much to the delight of the crowd that included Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw. He had boldly predicted he would hit an ace earlier that day. Although this marked his first hole in one at Augusta, his accomplishment was somewhat overshadowed by Camilo Villegas—who also made an ace on the fourth and another on the eighth—on a day that saw five aces in total, with Villegas eventually losing in a playoff to Kevin Streelman. The passage also recalls Nicklaus's storied career, noting he became the youngest to earn a green jacket in 1963, won his sixth title in 1986, and is one of five men to complete the career grand slam."
11-3,"A juvenile female Omura’s whale, measuring 5.68 meters, was found washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Cyclone Olwyn. Identified via DNA profiling by Department of Parks and Wildlife staff, it marks the first discovery of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Environment Minister Albert Jacob described the find as highly significant for research, since little is known about a species first documented in 2003 that is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters near Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. The whale, noted for its sleek body and distinctive skeletal features (including a specific number of vertebrae and digits on each pectoral fin), has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton later for further scientific study and potential museum display."
11-4,"A juvenile female Omura’s whale, a species considered nearly extinct and little understood since its first scientific description in 2003, was found washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This discovery marks the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff confirmed the 5.68‑meter specimen was an Omura’s whale using DNA profiling. Typically found in Indonesian, Philippine, and Sea of Japan waters, the whale’s sleek body and distinctive skeletal features—including a noted count of either 53 or 63 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin—are significant for scientists. The find is expected to enhance identification guides and understanding of the species’ regional distribution, with the skeleton to be recovered in the coming years for further research and potential public display."

10-0,"The passage reports that the ""black box"" from the Su-24 jet was opened in Moscow, and initial findings indicate missing flight data that could shed light on the jet's location when it was hit. The jet was downed on November 24 by F-16 fighters, leading to a crisis between Russia and Turkey—Turkey insists the jet ignored warnings in its airspace over Syria, while Russia claims it was downed within Syrian airspace. Both crew members ejected, but the pilot was killed (apparently by militants), and a rescuing Russian marine also died. In response, Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey, including a ban on package holidays, and demanded an apology from the Turkish government. An in-depth analysis of the black box data is expected next week."
10-2,"The passage reports that an explosion at a chemical plant in Zhangzhou city, Fujian province, China injured six people, with five injured by broken glass. The incident, caused by an oil leak at an oil storage facility during Monday night and sparking a huge fire, led to more than 600 firefighters battling the blaze, which has now been brought under control. The plant, which produces paraxylene—a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in making polyester films and fabrics—has been controversial. Residents near the plant reported hearing a loud blast and feeling tremors. The plant had been the target of earlier protests due to pollution concerns and was previously involved in another explosion in July 2013 that did not result in casualties or toxic spills, having been relocated from Xiamen following public backlash in 2007."
10-3,"In autumn 2004 a 15‐year‐old girl met a man named David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage, where the incident now under charge took place. The defendant—now 34, who changed her name in 2012 and is referred to as Davina—stands accused of raping the teenager while two others were asleep. The victim, who drank only a little and clearly remembered the events, had shouted and swore at the defendant to try to stop the attack. During the trial, Davina discussed her sexuality, noting she had not pursued any physical changes or medication. The court also heard that she, who has learning difficulties, attempted suicide last summer; as a result, special protocols have been arranged for her detention. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody—likely in a male prison in Winchester due to concerns about her risk to herself and the possibility of her not attending court—with sentencing set for 4 March."
10-4,"Eugene, USA, has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships. Instead of following the usual bidding process, the IAAF Council seized what it called a unique strategic opportunity to stage the championships in the USA, marking the first such event in the country. Although Eugene lost its bid for the 2019 event—which was awarded to Doha—it managed to convince the IAAF with a persuasive recent presentation. IAAF President Lamine Diack highlighted that this decision, similar to the process used for the 2007 championships in Osaka, leverages strong public, private, and institutional support to further the global development of the sport."

Though his brain injury initially affected his speech, he now speaks unaided and remains known for his personality and wit. He spends 12 hours daily in the gym and rehab and is actively involved in fundraising for military charities and supporting the Pilgrim Bandits. Since carrying the torch, he has received thousands of friend requests on Facebook—far exceeding the site's 5,000-friend limit—and his family has been overwhelmed by the public support.

13-1,"The passage reveals that Demelza Poldark, who was barely showing last week, is now a new mother, with Ross Poldark depicted lovingly admiring his baby daughter. Despite women's hopes of winning over Ross, he remains unavailable. The storyline notably compresses the pregnancy timeline: Demelza is mentioned as being eight months pregnant at the start of the episode, yet she gives birth almost immediately afterward, a rapid progression that echoes a similar plot device from a previous episode. Fans have remarked on this abrupt timeline on Twitter."
13-2,"The passage reports that 272 children affected by foetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalized in England over the past year, though experts warn that many more may be affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy. It cites World Health Organization research estimating that about 1 in 100 UK babies—or roughly 7,500 annually—could suffer learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to alcohol exposure in the womb. The article highlights the long-lasting impact of the syndrome through the example of 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who requires lifelong care, and notes that medical issues from prenatal alcohol exposure can include organ problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. Government guidelines currently advise minimal drinking during pregnancy, but experts like Elizabeth Mitchell argue that pregnant women should refrain from alcohol entirely."
13-3,"Scotland’s women’s team, having won all five qualifiers so far, is set to host unbeaten Iceland at Falkirk Stadium—a result that would likely secure their place in next summer’s finals in the Netherlands without a play-off. Forward Evans, who has experienced previous near-misses in major competitions, is determined to avoid further heartbreak, noting the importance of building on successes like her recent Bundesliga win with Bayern Munich. The upcoming match, along with a return fixture in Reykjavik on September 20, will be crucial in deciding group standings. Additionally, Evans highlights that having many national team players competing in top foreign leagues enhances overall team strength and competitiveness."

As the plane touched down at the Aero Acres Residential Airpark, its propellers hit the tarmac with a memorable sound and sustained damage. Noticing the error, the pilot quickly re-engaged the engines, and despite the rough touchdown and damaged propellers, managed to take off and later flew 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale, where he landed safely. The pilot, Chris Georgaklis, aged 85 and with nearly 50 years of experience, was accompanied by his dog, Buddy. The passage also notes that gear-up landings are generally caused by human error or mechanical faults, and that the FAA is investigating the incident."

12-0,"A 5.68‐meter juvenile female omura’s whale washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia following Cyclone Olwyn. Initially difficult to identify, DNA profiling confirmed the species—a rarely seen whale first described in 2003 and typically found in Indonesian, Philippine, and Sea of Japan waters. This is the first recorded sighting in WA and only the second in Australia. Scientists highlighted the discovery’s significance, noting that the whale’s unique skeletal features (including a sleek body and a specific number of vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin) provide valuable data to improve identification guides and understanding of its regional distribution. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton in a few years for further research and possible museum display."
