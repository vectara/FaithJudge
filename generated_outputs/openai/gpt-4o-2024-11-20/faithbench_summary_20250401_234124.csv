14-0,"Militants, claimed by the so-called Islamic State (IS), attacked the Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan, using explosives and firearms, killing and wounding dozens. The assault began with a bomb at the hospital gate, followed by gunmen targeting staff and patients. Afghan commandos killed all four attackers after hours of fighting. This marks a shift in IS tactics, resembling Taliban methods, and suggests increased resources and training. IS has previously targeted civilians but now appears to be escalating attacks to gain attention, despite limited territorial control. Afghan leaders condemned the attack, emphasizing its violation of human values. IS has been active in Afghanistan since 2015, carrying out numerous deadly attacks, while the Taliban also continues its offensive."

This decision, described as a ""third way,"" was influenced by personal reasons, particularly his family's plans to return to Canada in 2018, coinciding with key educational milestones for his daughters. While some speculated political pressure or disillusionment with Brexit's economic impact played a role, Carney emphasized it was a personal decision. Professionally, he felt it was important to remain during the critical Brexit negotiations, with the Article 50 process expected to conclude by 2019, after which a new Governor would take over. Despite speculation, there was no tension with Prime Minister Theresa May, who left the decision to him."

These groups operate independently but play significant roles in the information and cyber warfare surrounding the conflict."

15-3,"A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that heavy drinking in the U.S. increased by 17.2% from 2005 to 2012, driven largely by rising rates among women as social norms shift. Binge drinking among women rose significantly, with rates increasing more than seven times those of men. In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers, and 18% were binge drinkers. Factors contributing to increased alcohol consumption include changing social norms, affordability of alcohol, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies.

This shocking moment tarnished Duran's reputation, though he later redeemed himself by winning another title in 1983.

Judge Ian Pearson remanded her to custody, likely in a male prison, citing risks of self-harm and non-attendance if released on bail. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties, changed her name in 2012 and has not undergone physical or medical gender transitions. Protocols for her detention have been established. The judge described the case as unusual and challenging."

Eugene had previously failed in its bid to host the 2019 event, which was awarded to Doha, Qatar. IAAF President Lamine Diack emphasized the collaboration of public authorities, private sector, and other stakeholders in Eugene as a key factor in the decision. A similar exception to the bidding process occurred for the 2007 championships in Osaka, Japan."
