15599,"Blue Bell Creameries has shut down its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant “out of an abundance of caution” after listeria monocytogenes was found in a 3-ounce cup of ice cream produced there in April 2014. The CDC has warned consumers and institutions not to eat Blue Bell–branded products from that facility—specifically 3-ounce servings coded with letters O, P, Q, R, S or T—although other Blue Bell products remain unaffected. Listeria matching the contaminated hospital sample was also found in additional plant samples, though it did not genetically match strains from patients in a recent Kansas outbreak. Earlier this year, in response to that Kansas incident (five infections and three deaths at one hospital) Blue Bell recalled products from its Texas plant, later adding 3-ounce cups. Investigations into whether these illnesses are linked to Blue Bell continue. The CDC advises disposing of recalled items. This is the company’s first recall in its 108-year history. Listeriosis—most dangerous to the elderly, pregnant women and immunocompromised people—causes fever, muscle aches and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms; about 1,600 serious U.S. cases occur annually, with a 16% fatality rate."
15601,"An independent Columbia Journalism School review found that Rolling Stone suffered “an institutional failure” in reporting, editing, supervising and fact-checking its flawed 2014 article about a supposed UVA gang rape. Managing editor Will Dana apologized to readers, UVA administrators and students, and members of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.  

Virginia law defines libel as publication of a false, defamatory statement with the requisite intent. Because the article presented alleged facts that appear untrue, private individuals (like the fraternity members) must show it harmed their reputations and that Rolling Stone knew or should have known it was false. UVA itself cannot sue for defamation because governments have no such cause of action.  

Group defamation is generally not actionable—statements must be “of or concerning” the plaintiff—but a “small group” exception allows individual members to sue if the group is sufficiently limited. Phi Kappa Psi may invoke that exception, while other, larger fraternities likely cannot. Finally, plaintiffs must prove tangible financial harm, making successful defamation actions rare."
15604,"The author, who in 1967 became the first woman and first person of color elected to the Kentucky State Senate, criticizes Senator Rand Paul’s newly launched presidential campaign for professing an inclusive message while repeatedly opposing key civil rights advances. Although Paul claims to be the GOP’s minority‐outreach candidate, the author argues his record reveals no genuine commitment to minority concerns. She cites his calls to “take our country back” to pre–Civil Rights Act days, his desire to eliminate the Department of Education, his efforts to restrict women’s reproductive choices, his opposition to protections for DREAMers, and his dismissive response to strengthening the Voting Rights Act. She also notes his condescending tone at historically black colleges and his support for allowing private businesses to discriminate. By contrasting Paul’s stance with President Obama’s 50th-anniversary tribute at Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge—where Obama urged renewed efforts to protect voting rights—the author insists America needs more democracy, not less. She concludes that Paul’s outdated positions disqualify him from leadership and that voters deserve a candidate who respects civil‐rights progress rather than seeks to undo it."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau was a 34-year-old married teacher in Seattle when, in 1996, she began a sexual relationship with her 13-year-old student, Vili Fualaau. She gave birth to his child, served more than seven years in prison on related charges, and upon her 2005 release the two married. Now 10 years into their marriage—with two teenage daughters of their own—53-year-old Letourneau and 31-year-old Fualaau will appear in an exclusive ABC “20/20” interview with Barbara Walters. She will discuss how their marriage endures despite their age gap, her plans to teach again and seek removal from the sex-offender registry; he will speak about his struggles with alcoholism and depression and how he feels the system failed him as a minor."
15616,"Kanye West and photographer Daniel Ramos have quietly settled a civil suit over a July 2013 altercation at Los Angeles International Airport in which West rushed Ramos and tried to grab his camera. West had earlier pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge, receiving two years’ probation, anger-management classes and community service. Ramos—represented by Gloria Allred—had sought general and punitive damages for interference with his right to work. The trial was called off after West issued a formal apology to Ramos and the two shook hands. Allred said the settlement “sent an important message” that celebrities aren’t above the law. The original incident, captured on video, shows about 15 seconds of scuffling after Ramos repeatedly called out to West. The passage also notes West resolved a separate 2014 Beverly Hills assault claim through a civil settlement."
15617,"B.B. King, 89, was briefly hospitalized for dehydration linked to his Type II diabetes but has since been released and is resting at home with his grandchildren, his daughter Claudette King and publicist Angela Moore told the Los Angeles Times. King issued a statement thanking fans for their concern and left the hospital the same day.  

Known as “Blues Boy,” he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and has received 30 Grammy nominations. Over the years he has played various Gibson guitars—each named Lucille—and in the 1980s Gibson introduced a custom “Lucille” signature model for him. Among his best-known songs are “The Thrill Is Gone” (his first Grammy winner in 1970), “There Must Be a Better World Somewhere,” and “When Love Comes to Town” (with U2). Last year he also missed the end of his tour after dehydration and exhaustion following a Chicago show.

15623,"Chris Copeland, a forward for the Indiana Pacers, and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were stabbed just before 4 a.m. Wednesday after leaving the 1OAK nightclub in Chelsea and walking toward their car near the Fulton Houses. A 22-year-old suspect—who never entered the club—stabbed Copeland in the abdomen and elbow, Saltara in multiple places, and a third woman in the stomach; a knife was recovered and the suspect is in custody awaiting charges. Copeland is in stable condition at a New York hospital. Two Atlanta Hawks players, Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha, who had played in Atlanta the previous night, were not involved in the stabbing but were arrested at the scene on obstruction and disorderly-conduct charges (Sefolosha also faces resisting-arrest). Both teams and league officials released statements saying they are gathering information; Antic and Sefolosha plan to contest the charges. The Hawks, in New York to play the Nets, announced neither player will suit up; the Pacers are slated to face the Knicks Wednesday night."
15627,"Twenty years after Selena’s death, her family is launching “Selena the One,” a hologram-like, walking-talking-singing-dancing digital version of the Tejano star. Developed with Nevada’s Acrovirt LLC, it uses the company’s “Digitized Human Essence” technology to autonomously learn and react like Selena. Sister Suzette Quintanilla says the project—meant to grow her legacy, not replace her—will let new fans experience Selena’s persona. In addition to the hologram, the family plans to release new songs, videos, collaborations and to tour in 2018. An Indiegogo campaign (starting April 16 at selenatheone.com) seeks $500,000 in funding. Fans will also honor Selena at Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi on April 17–18."
15628,"An Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle to Los Angeles turned back just 14 minutes after takeoff on Monday when the pilot reported loud banging from the pressurized, temperature-controlled cargo hold. Crewmembers discovered the source was a missing Menzies Aviation ramp agent who had fallen asleep inside. Passengers heard pounding and faint cries for help before a federal air marshal responded from the cabin, reassuring the person below. The plane made an emergency landing, was met by emergency crews, and the agent was checked at a hospital, passed a drug test and was released. His team hadn’t realized he was still on board, and Alaska Airlines—whose ramp staff all hold security badges and undergo background checks—is now investigating the incident. The flight of 170 passengers and six crew members departed again and arrived in Los Angeles that evening."
15634,"Emy Afalava, born in American Samoa—a U.S. territory since 1900—and a decorated veteran, has lived under American law his whole life yet is denied U.S. citizenship and the right to vote. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, “all persons born … in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens,” but American Samoans remain excluded. Afalava and others have sued in the D.C. Circuit to secure the citizenship they believe the Constitution guarantees. The passage traces earlier racial exclusions: the Dred Scott decision barred African-Americans from citizenship until the Civil War–era Amendments reversed it, and in 1904 the Supreme Court in Gonzalez v. Williams refused to label Puerto Ricans aliens yet stopped short of granting them citizenship, reflecting racial biases that treated U.S. territories’ residents as second-class. Today, American Samoans are the last U.S. territory inhabitants still denied full citizenship rights."
15638,"Iman Hashi (25) and her sister Siham (27) were born in Mogadishu but fled the 1991 Somali civil war with their family and settled in Canada as refugees. In their teens they discovered a passion for music and, after stops in Atlanta, are now in Los Angeles recording their debut album—a fusion of pop, hip-hop and African percussion—working and co-writing with producer Elijah Kelley. Signed to Warner Brothers Records, they’ve retained creative control and are in the final mixing stages, preparing a rollout and first single. Outside music, they’ve served as UNHCR spokespeople, founded a nonprofit to support refugees, headlined World Refugee Day and Geneva’s Nansen Awards, and launched “Wish Creatively,” a jewelry line that funds women’s projects in Kenya and Somalia. Through both their art and advocacy, they aim to redefine what it means to be refugees and creative ambassadors for their generation and homeland."
15651,"The passage explains the unique challenges the Pope faces in balancing spiritual leadership of nearly a billion Catholics with the diplomatic responsibilities of the Vatican state. It focuses on Pope Francis’s recent decision to indirectly label the 1915 mass killings of up to 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks as “the first genocide of the 20th century,” quoting a 2001 document of St. John Paul II. Previous popes had avoided or softened the term to preserve relations with Turkey, which rejects the genocide label and has become a partner against ISIS’s persecution of Christians. By citing his predecessor, Francis maintained the Vatican’s emphasis on continuity in moral and diplomatic stances while still acknowledging Armenian grievances. Turkey responded by recalling its ambassador and condemning the Pope’s remark as “unacceptable.” The passage also notes Francis’s broader diplomatic activism—such as mediating US–Cuba detente and hosting Israeli and Palestinian leaders—alongside his willingness to speak bluntly on issues from defending force against ISIS to criticizing satirists who mock religion. Finally, it highlights his call for priests to speak truthfully and courageously."
15652,"The National Park Service and National Park Foundation are hosting National Park Week from April 18 to 26, during which the 128 fee-charging sites (including Yellowstone and Yosemite) will waive entrance fees on Saturday and Sunday.

15661,"Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) has sent a second remote-controlled, shape-shifting robot into the damaged Fukushima Daiichi reactors—following the failure of a first probe on April 10—to assess conditions after the March 2011 meltdown. The new robot, deployed on April 15, successfully reached all 11 survey points and recorded lower-than-expected radiation and temperature levels, suggesting cooling systems are working. It also captured images of a mysterious green glow and yellowed grating discoloration, though causes remain unknown and the glow wasn’t visible from other angles. TEPCO’s chief Akira Ono called the mission “a great step forward” for the much-costly, multi-year decommissioning, which remains too hazardous for human entry."
15665,"In the sentencing phase of the Boston Marathon bombing trial, jurors heard heart-wrenching victim-impact testimony after finding 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts. Families of the four people he killed—29-year-old Krystle Campbell; Chinese grad student Lingzi Lu; 8-year-old Martin Richard; and MIT officer Sean Collier—described the “holes” left in their lives and showed photos of them as loving sons, daughters and friends. Campbell’s father wept for his “Princess,” and prosecutors stressed that Tsarnaev deliberately targeted innocents who “had time to feel pain, to be scared, but no time to say goodbye.” Survivors gave graphic accounts of the April 2013 blasts: high-school senior Gillian Reny described seeing her own shattered shin bone and fearing she’d die in a pool of blood; Celeste Corcoran recounted losing both legs and living with constant, agonizing phantom pain. Jurors also saw a defiant 2013 mug shot of Tsarnaev raising his middle finger, underscoring prosecutors’ argument that he remains “unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.” Their goal: to show the human cost behind the death-penalty decision."

15670,"Polish aristocrat Jan Zylinski has posted a video on YouTube challenging UKIP leader Nigel Farage to a duel in Hyde Park—sword in hand—to protest Farage’s anti-immigration rhetoric and what Zylinski calls growing discrimination against Poles in Britain. Farage, campaigning for Britain’s exit from the EU and blaming free movement for an influx of Eastern European migrants, has declined the offer, saying he has no sword and instead criticizes the loss of Poland’s “brightest and best” young people.  

In the same clip, Zylinski offers a less martial alternative—a televised debate—and in a second video lists “7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,” citing Polish RAF pilots in World War II, a strong work ethic, smooth integration and loyalty to Britain. He urges Britons to stop “knocking the Poles” and to appreciate their contributions. Meanwhile, another UKIP member tweeted an image of a knight split in two, apparently backing Farage in any hypothetical duel."
15673,"A small Cessna 414 carrying seven people, including Illinois State University associate men’s basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch, crashed late Monday about two miles east of Central Illinois Regional Airport near Bloomington as it returned from the NCAA Final Four championship in Indianapolis. The identities of the other five passengers were not immediately known. ISU President Larry Dietz and Athletic Director Larry Lyons expressed shock and deep sadness, praising Ward and Leetch as respected, much-loved colleagues. Ward had been a standout guard at UAB (1996–2000), played professionally in China, and joined ISU’s staff in 2012, becoming associate head coach in 2014. Leetch came to ISU in 2005, left for Whitworth University, and returned in 2013 as deputy athletic director, overseeing communications, video production, and several sports programs."
15683,"During the third day of the Boston Marathon bombing penalty phase, survivors and witnesses described the April 2013 blast’s horrific aftermath as the prosecution rested its case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Biomedical researcher Steve Woolfenden testified that, after glimpsing his bleeding 3-year-old son Leo still conscious in a stroller, he discovered his own Achilles tendon severed and his tibia protruding, then applied a tourniquet and watched a stranger carry his son to safety. Trauma surgeon Dr. David King, a former combat surgeon, said the carnage at Massachusetts General Hospital matched war‐zone injuries he’d treated. Heather Abbott recounted being thrown into a restaurant, suffering a shattered heel and electing below-knee amputation after three failed limb-salvage attempts. Marc Fucarile described severe burns, the self-amputation of his right leg, ongoing blisters from a prosthesis and likely future amputation of his badly damaged left leg. Testimony about 8-year-old Martin Richard’s death included Dr. King’s medical explanation of fatal shrapnel wounds and Woolfenden’s account of Martin’s singed, bloodied body and his mother’s desperate pleas. The jury will now weigh whether Tsarnaev should receive the death penalty or life in prison; defense witnesses are expected to begin on Monday."
15690,"Actress Sofia Vergara and her ex-fiancé, businessman Nick Loeb, are locked in a Los Angeles court dispute over two female embryos they created by IVF in November 2013 while engaged. After their split in May 2014, Loeb filed an anonymous suit (“Joe Doe” vs. “Jane Doe”) seeking an order preventing Vergara from destroying the embryos and asking that they remain frozen until both parties agree on their fate. The Art Reproductive Center, where the embryos are stored, is also named as a defendant. According to court papers, the couple already tried—unsuccessfully—to use two surrogates. Loeb says he wants the embryos implanted in a surrogate, waives all financial claims on Vergara and would even let her play a role if she changes her mind. Vergara previously explained she froze eggs to “plan ahead.” Legal experts note that when partners disagree, courts decide whether frozen embryos are “property” or “human life,” and in California, both parties must consent before embryos can be destroyed."
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, a 65-year-old grandmother in Luxor, Egypt, has for 43 years dressed as a man in a traditional jalabiya to support herself and her daughter after her husband’s death. Widowed at 21 with no family help and expecting her daughter, she first earned a few cents as a brick maker, then saved to buy a shoeshine kit and joined the all-male shoe shiners. Her deep, raspy voice and weathered face reinforced her male guise, which she says was necessary to earn enough to send her daughter, Houda, to school and later support her grandchildren. After a televised interview, the Luxor governor offered her a kiosk and cash advance—provided she remained in male dress. Egypt’s president recently honored her as one of the country’s ideal mothers."
15695,"A Massachusetts jury deliberated for more than 35 hours over seven days—after hearing over 130 witnesses and reviewing 400 pieces of evidence—and returned a first-degree murder verdict against former NFL star Aaron Hernandez for the 2013 shooting death of his friend Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, once on a $40 million contract, was sentenced to life without parole. Jurors described the process as emotionally grueling and said they were struck by Hernandez’s apparent indifference—he shot Lloyd six times, then spent hours sunbathing and drinking smoothies with co-defendants by a pool. Foreperson Lesa Strachan called the multiple gunshots “unnecessary,” and fellow jurors Rosalie Oliver and Kelly Dorsey said even a single shot would have been “cruel.” They emphasized that Hernandez’s fame and wealth did not influence their decision. Co-defendants Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, who were in the car with Lloyd the night he was killed, have pleaded not guilty and will face separate trials."
15696,"SkyWest Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 carrying 84 passengers and nine crew from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency descent of 28,000 feet in three minutes before landing in Buffalo, New York, after the flight attendant warned of a pressurization problem. Passenger Larry Johnson, traveling with his brother, girlfriend and 8-month-old son, recalled feeling dizzy, lightheaded and unable to breathe; three people briefly lost consciousness and 15 were examined by medical personnel on the ground, though none were hospitalized. SkyWest maintenance found no pressurization fault and the airline—along with the FAA and NTSB—is still investigating the cause. Onboard nurse Mary Cunningham treated a gray, nauseous passenger with oxygen and then felt lightheaded herself when another woman began to collapse. CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo described the rapid descent as “like a roller coaster,” and passengers were relieved when the flight touched down safely."
15700,"The passage argues that while juries often expect remorseful defendants, Aaron Hernandez displayed unapologetic swagger—winking at his fiancée, refusing to offer an alibi or show shame—when he stood trial for the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd. Despite his lawyer conceding Hernandez had “witnessed” the murder, the jury convicted him of first-degree murder and related weapons charges, sentencing him to life without parole. Once a celebrated University of Florida tight end and a $40 million New England Patriot, Hernandez’s off-field issues—bar fights, drug troubles and ties to violence—had already earned him a “troubled” label. The author contends the Patriots and the NFL responded appropriately by cutting him immediately, underscores that no one could have predicted his lethal turn, and mourns the ruin of both Lloyd’s and Hernandez’s lives."
15702,"The Houston Express, a 1,000-foot container ship, rescued 37-year-old Louis Jordan more than 500 miles off the U.S. East Coast after he spent 66 days drifting at sea on his 35-foot Pearson sailboat. Jordan left Conway, South Carolina, to fish; a storm capsized his boat days later, broke his mast and fractured his shoulder. He rigged a makeshift sail but was repeatedly overturned by currents and storms. With supplies gone, he collected rainwater when conditions allowed and caught fish by using his laundry as bait. When spotted, Jordan was alert, knew the exact date and was in unexpectedly good physical shape despite dehydration and hunger. He was flown to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, where Coast Guard and medical personnel found no inconsistencies in his account. His father, Frank Jordan, had reported him missing on January 29 and praised his son’s physical and spiritual strength. Jordan, an unemployed truck driver who lived on his well-maintained boat “Angel,” is expected to return to Bucksport Plantation Marina next week."
15708,"French prosecutor Brice Robin said he’s unaware of any onboard video from Germanwings Flight 9525 and that no videos have been used in the investigation. He urged anyone holding such footage to relinquish it immediately. This statement came after German daily Bild and French Paris Match claimed they’d seen a cell-phone recording from the wreckage capturing the plane’s final seconds—cries, metallic banging and intensified screams—though neither magazine has released the clip. France’s air accident agency (BEA) and the Gendarmerie, which has collected but not yet analyzed phones from the crash site, deny any video exists and reject suggestions of leaks.

Separately, Lufthansa confirmed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz disclosed a “previous episode of severe depression” to his flight school in 2009 and provided medical documents before resuming training. Investigators and prosecutors have received his training and medical records. Authorities are examining whether Lubitz feared losing his pilot’s license and if that motivated the crash. Meanwhile, recovery teams continue to gather debris and human remains—with DNA identification expected soon—and plan to return passengers’ personal effects, including any additional cell phones."
15714,"A nuclear submarine in dry dock at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire when welding work ignited the rubber insulation between its light and pressure hull. The vessel, under repair since November 2013, had no ammunition, armaments, chemically dangerous substances or fissionable materials on board, and its nuclear fuel had already been unloaded. All personnel evacuated safely, no one was injured, and the fire posed no threat to people or the shipyard."
15733,"John Travolta, one of Scientology’s highest-profile members, says he hasn’t seen—and isn’t interested in—HBO’s new documentary “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,” which is based on Lawrence Wright’s critical book about the church. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times while premiering his film The Forger in Clearwater, Florida, Travolta explained that his own 40-year experience with Scientology has been “so happy” and “brilliant” that he has no reason to give credence to what he sees as “hearsay” from “disgruntled” former members. He added that the church helped him cope with the 2009 death of his teen son, Jett."
15735,"A Lamborghini in the Exotic Driving Experience program at Walt Disney World Speedway crashed into a guardrail on Sunday, killing the 36-year-old passenger, Gary Terry of Davenport, Florida. The 24-year-old driver, Tavon Watson of Kissimmee, Florida, lost control of the car and sustained minor injuries. Petty Holdings, which runs the Exotic Driving Experience and the Richard Petty Driving Experience, expressed “deepest sympathies” in a statement. CNN’s Vivan Kuo and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report."
15739,"The CDC reports a gastrointestinal illness outbreak aboard the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity, affecting 100 people (95 of 2,117 passengers and 5 of 964 crew). The cause is still undetermined; two CDC staffers will board the vessel in San Diego on Monday. The Infinity departed San Diego on March 29 and most recently stopped in Puerto Vallarta on April 10. Celebrity Cruises has stepped up cleaning and disinfection, kept passengers informed, and is supplying CDC with patient specimens. This is the ship’s third such outbreak (previously in 2006 and 2013); the vessel was built in 2001 and refurbished in 2011."
15740,"Graffiti dating to World War I has been discovered in a centuries-old chalk quarry and underground “city” near Naours, France, about 120 miles north of Paris. Carved or chalked on walls in July 1916, the inscriptions include names and units—e.g. “HJ Leach, Merely a private, 13/7/16, SA Australia,” “HA Deanate, 148th Aero Squadron, USA,” and members of the 9th Battalion Australians. Photographer Jeff Gusky, an ER doctor in East Texas and National Geographic contributor, has documented the site in his portfolio “The Hidden World of WWI,” recording 1,821 names (roughly 40% Australian, most of the rest British, 55 American, and 662 untraced). The underground complex dates back centuries, was sealed in the 18th century, rediscovered in the late 19th century, and used by soldiers for shelter during battles like the Somme in 1916. Privately owned and largely off-limits until a consortium acquired access rights in 2013, the dark, maze-like passages—some bearing carved maps—have only recently been systematically explored. Gusky calls the graffiti a “treasure trove” that offers a poignant link to men, such as Private Leach, who sometimes never returned from the front."
15744,"The University of Virginia is under dual review—by the Virginia attorney general’s–hired firm O’Melveny & Myers and by the U.S. Department of Education’s Title IX office—over its handling of campus sexual–assault allegations. That scrutiny was intensified when Rolling Stone retracted Sabrina Rubin Erdely’s 2014 article about “Jackie,” who claimed she was gang–raped at a fraternity in 2012. Although Jackie reported the incident to UVA in spring 2013 and to police only after a separate alleged assault in 2014, investigators say she refused to cooperate both times, so no charges were filed. UVA has never expelled a student for sexual assault—even when admissions were made—so after the article noted that 183 students had been expelled for honor‐code violations since 1998 but none for assault, the school announced an undefined “zero-tolerance” policy. 

Despite its factual errors—highlighted in a Columbia Journalism School review that faulted Erdely for not interviewing Jackie’s friends—Rolling Stone’s story prompted dozens of other women to come forward with less dramatic accounts of “bad experience” euphemisms, rapey fraternities, date-rape drugs and a reporting system they deemed ineffective if perpetrators weren’t removed. A separate civil suit alleges UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence. Survivors like Sarah Roderick say the sensational focus on one horrific case discredits more common experiences and fear of being labeled liars may now deter reporting, even as student-body president Abraham Axler and Columbia dean Steve Coll agree the story—flawed though it was—forced needed conversation and exposed serious, unresolved questions about UVA’s response to sexual assault."
15747,"Chinese-born, American-based Jia Jiang quit his six-figure tech job at age 30—just weeks before his first child arrived—and, stung by an investment rejection, set himself “100 Days of Rejection.”  Each day he made an outlandish request (from borrowing $100 from strangers to asking a Krispy Kreme manager to craft five interlinked “Olympic” doughnuts).  When manager Jackie Braun said yes, his video went viral, leading to talk-show bookings, speaking engagements and unexpected job offers.  His true aim, he says, was to conquer his own fear of rejection and help others do the same.  This week Jiang publishes Rejection Proof, part self-help guide and part memoir, in which he lays out eight core lessons:  
1. Fear of rejection often outweighs actual rejection.  
2. Success is a numbers game—keep asking.  
3. A “no” isn’t a measure of your idea’s worth.  
4. Stay engaged after a refusal.  
5. Ask why you were turned down and address it.  
6. Decide in advance how many “no’s” you’ll endure.  
7. Treat rejection like muscle training—build resilience.  
8. Remember rejection reflects others’ views, not your value.  
Jiang’s mission: to transform rejection from obstacle into opportunity."
15753,"Over the past year, more than 25,000 people have contracted Ebola—about as many as live in Key West, Florida—and over 10,000 have died. Survivors face lasting changes, and the outbreak exposed weaknesses in public-health systems worldwide. Although the worst-case forecast of over a million cases by January did not occur and weekly new infections have fallen (30 confirmed in the week of April 5, the lowest since May 2014), dozens still arise each week. In Liberia and Sierra Leone, cases have dropped so far that treatment centers are being closed, but in Guinea recent data—19 deaths (7 diagnosed only after death) and 21 unsafe burials in the same week—suggest hidden chains of transmission may spark new cases. Photos accompanying the report show how roles such as grave diggers and first responders have been transformed by the epidemic."
15759,"The author begins by describing the bystander video of Officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott eight times in the back and then planting evidence—footage that would otherwise have been hidden behind an “active investigation.” This single video, the author argues, makes clear that Scott posed no threat and underscores why police body-worn cameras are urgently needed. Although costly to procure and maintain, body cameras would deter misconduct, reduce civilian complaints and use-of-force incidents, help avoid expensive lawsuits, and—most importantly—save lives. The piece acknowledges that body cameras are only an interim measure against a deeper problem: a systemic bias against Black men in law enforcement and the criminal justice system. While long-term solutions require societal reforms in hiring, training and addressing racial and economic disparities, equipping officers with body cameras today can immediately shine a spotlight on misconduct and begin to rebuild public trust."
15778,"Thousands of Yazidis who fled ISIS’s August assault on Sinjar now live in the Shariya refugee camp near Duhok in Iraqi Kurdistan, a sprawling site of over 4,000 tents where children play amid drab rows and distant airstrike echoes. Many who remained were seized: women and girls as young as eight were sold into sexual slavery, men forced to convert or be killed. Among them was Ahlam and her family, who were loaded into trucks at gunpoint, imprisoned in Tal Afar, then moved village to village and compelled into labor. Ahlam secretly phoned her husband, Mahmoud, restoring his hope after months of believing her dead. The captives endured public torture—broken bones and bodies paraded through streets—and watched ISIS fighters remove the elderly, prompting Ahlam’s daring midnight escape with her three children. Eight agonizing months later, she and Mahmoud reunited in Kurdistan, though his parents remain unaccounted for. A recent release of 217 mainly elderly Yazidis offers scant relief while dozens of women and children are still held. Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil, part of Iraq’s delegation to the U.N., is urging greater international support and airstrikes to defeat ISIS and rescue the remaining captives. Ahlam, spared sexual enslavement only because she was breastfeeding, says her greatest trauma is hearing the screams of girls dragged away."
15779,"Debra Lobo, a 55-year-old American and vice principal at Karachi’s Jinnah Medical and Dental College, was shot in the right cheek and left arm Thursday by two assailants on a motorcycle as she drove to pick up her daughters. Found unconscious but expected to survive, she is now being treated at Aga Khan Hospital. Police recovered Urdu pamphlets from her car reading “America should be burnt.” Lobo, who has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Pakistani librarian, is the subject of an ongoing Karachi police investigation, with the U.S. Consulate in close contact."
15786,"Two weeks after falling ill during a family vacation in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, two Delaware boys (ages 14 and 16) remain comatose and their father, Steve Esmond, is conscious but paralyzed. The mother, Theresa Devine, has been released from hospital and is in occupational therapy. The family became sick—experiencing seizures and unconsciousness—at a villa they’d rented at the Sirenusa resort since March 14 and were airlifted back to U.S. hospitals. 

Preliminary EPA tests found methyl bromide, a highly toxic pesticide restricted for indoor use, in their unit. Officials are sampling air and surfaces and investigating whether a March 18 fumigation at the resort violated environmental rules. The villa below theirs was treated by Terminix under Sea Glass Vacations’ management; their own unit was not. 

The U.S. Department of Justice has opened a criminal probe (noted in a ServiceMaster/Terminix SEC filing), which describes the family’s injuries as “serious.” Terminix says it is cooperating fully, and final EPA test results are due next week."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association has formally banned its members from participating in executions, declaring such involvement incompatible with their role as health care providers. This policy, approved at the Association’s annual meeting, reinforces earlier APhA positions opposing the use of the word “drug” for lethal-injection chemicals and resisting laws that mandate or forbid pharmacists’ participation in executions. The move responds to renewed scrutiny of lethal injection following high-profile cases—Clayton Lockett’s botched Oklahoma execution last year, a Georgia execution delay over cloudy medications, and a recent Supreme Court stay—and to shortages of pentobarbital after its manufacturer ceased supplying prisons. With 32 states still allowing capital punishment (mostly by lethal injection), some—like Utah—have restored alternatives such as firing squads. APhA’s stance aligns with those of the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association and American Board of Anesthesiology."
15791,"A new strategy in climate‐change discussions reframes the issue as a direct public‐health concern rather than an abstract environmental debate. At a National Public Health Week roundtable at Howard University, President Obama, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy emphasized how air quality and other environmental changes already affect respiratory health, especially among vulnerable groups. Obama cited 1970s Los Angeles smog and its dramatic improvement under the Clean Air Act as proof that policy and technology can yield health and economic benefits. Murthy shared his personal experience with asthma—his uncle’s death—and warned that climate change may worsen such conditions. A cited American Thoracic Society study found seven in ten doctors linking climate change to rising patient health problems. The panel highlighted efforts by public‐health agencies, medical schools and tech firms to develop real‐time air‐monitoring tools, plan preventive measures and mobilize communities. According to the EPA, health impacts will vary by region, population sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The WHO predicts an extra 250,000 deaths annually by 2050 from malaria, diarrhea, heat‐stroke and undernutrition, with children, the elderly and developing nations most at risk. Although public belief in global‐warming effects remains around 55%, experts suggest that emphasizing health threats makes the issue more relatable and actionable."
15800,"Cyclist Wang Pingan spent 460 days and more than 29,200 km pedaling through every major Chinese province on a shoestring budget of about $100 and a single mountain bike. Just days from his final destination in Hainan Island, he locked up that bike in Shenzhen’s busy Huaqiangbei district—only to have it stolen within ten minutes. Despite initial doubts, local police tracked the stolen bike (caught on surveillance and passed through two buyers), arrested a suspect and returned it to Wang. A recent university graduate, he had refused all offers of a replacement, calling his bike a “best friend” that carried him through hardship. Now reunited with his two-wheeled companion, Wang is free to finish the last leg of his epic journey."
15817,"Migrants from more than 20 countries—including Eritrea, Somalia, Syria and a growing number from West Africa—are converging on Libya because it offers the easiest sea route to Europe. Their reasons vary—Eritreans fleeing indefinite military service and repression, Somalis escaping Al-Shabaab violence, Syrians despairing of return, and young West African men selling everything for economic opportunity or to join relatives already abroad. Nigerians are also coming to escape Boko Haram, and some African women are now being trafficked through Libya for sexual exploitation in Europe.

Their journeys follow established smuggling networks through the Sahara and Sahel—via Sudan, Niger’s Agadez (2,000–7,000 pass monthly), southern Algeria or Tunisia—and typically involve multiple hand-offs between small‐scale smugglers. Dangers include kidnapping, robbery, starvation, desert and sea crossings in unseaworthy boats (with migrants often locked in holds or sent off with only a compass), and rising risks from ISIS affiliates in Libya. In 2014, over 80% of these migrants aimed for Libya’s coast; Eritreans and Syrians made up half of Europe‐bound flows that year. As Libya has become more perilous, neighboring states (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) and destination countries are tightening borders, but the “push” of conflict, repression and economic collapse across Africa and the Middle East continues to drive the exodus."
11317,"Walmart’s public opposition to proposed “religious freedom” laws in Arkansas—and earlier in Indiana—helped prompt Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to demand changes before he would sign the bill, illustrating how the country’s largest retailer is emerging as a bellwether on hot-button issues. Joined by other CEOs (including Apple’s Tim Cook) and organizations such as the NCAA, Walmart warned that such laws would license discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. Its stance follows recent company moves—boosting pay well above the federal minimum wage for some 500,000 workers and expanding nondiscrimination policies (gender-identity protections in 2011 and same-sex partner health benefits in 2014). Prominent Republicans, notably former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, have urged the GOP to heed Walmart’s example by backing middle-class measures like a modest minimum-wage hike and outlawing anti-LGBT discrimination. The broader business community—from Angie’s List to NASCAR—also threatened boycotts or expansion freezes over Indiana’s law. As national Republicans such as Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz spar over where to strike the balance between religious liberty and nondiscrimination, business leaders continue to assert that equality is good for commerce and culture."
11323,"Easter is the central Christian feast marking Jesus’s atonement on Good Friday and his Resurrection on Easter Sunday. Over centuries it has acquired secular symbols—most notably the Easter bunny and decorated eggs—and, unlike Christmas, its date “floats” each spring. At the 325 AD Council of Nicaea, church leaders fixed Easter as the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. Because Eastern Orthodox churches still use the Julian calendar, they often celebrate Easter a week later than Western churches. Both the Jewish festival of Passover and Easter depend on lunar phases, which is why a blood-red “lunar eclipse” moon can coincide with Holy Week.

In Rome, Holy Week began with Palm Sunday, peaked in Pope Francis’s outdoor Easter Mass and Urbi et Orbi blessing at St. Peter’s, and included his traditional foot-washing rite. In Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Catholics and Armenian Christians held morning Mass and a procession on Easter Sunday; Eastern Orthodox Christians wait another week. 

The Easter bunny and egg customs likely originated in 17th-century Germany—famers had surplus eggs after Lenten fasting and turned to hiding, coloring, and gifting them—and were brought to America by German immigrants in the 1700s. A modern coloring tip: use a packet of Kool-Aid in hot water instead of vinegar for bright, stain-prone dyes."
11332,"Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told parliament that the Air Self‐Defense Force has never encountered any UFOs of extraterrestrial origin. He explained that while ASDF jets are scrambled to investigate unidentified aerial objects, these have turned out to be birds or human‐made items. The question came from former wrestler‐turned‐lawmaker Antonio Inoki, who in a Budget Committee hearing asked whether Japan’s jets had ever been deployed against aliens and whether any research on alien visitors was under way. Inoki—founder of New Japan Pro Wrestling, a one‐time MMA pioneer after his 1976 bout with Muhammad Ali, and a two-term member of the Upper House since 2013—also says he’s seen a UFO but isn’t sure if aliens exist. This isn’t Japan’s first political foray into the topic: in 2007, then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba raised the constitutional question of defending against an outer‐space invasion."
11349,"Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old Indiana native who inspired millions with her fight against an inoperable brain tumor, died early Friday. Diagnosed in 2013 with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma as a high-school senior, she continued playing basketball through chemotherapy and kept her commitment to Mount St. Joseph University. After the NCAA agreed to move up the season opener so she could suit up, Hill scored the first two points and the game’s final layup before a sell-out crowd wearing her “Never Give Up” slogan. She went on to help raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with The Cure Starts Now.  
At a campus memorial, coach Dan Benjamin, university president Tony Artez, and her high-school principal Bill Snyder celebrated her positivity, friendship and “unselfish” spirit. Social media and figures such as LeBron James and NCAA president Mark Emmert praised her courage and lasting legacy. In her own words, Hill urged others to cherish each moment, finish what they start and fight for their dreams."
11353,"The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department says that this week a 20–30-foot section of fiberglass boat—believed to have floated across the Pacific after Japan’s March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami—was spotted off Oregon’s coast and towed into Newport. Inside were live yellowtail jack fish normally found in Japanese waters. Biologists from the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University’s Hatfield Marine Science Center inspected the debris at sea and judged the invasive-species risk to be minimal. The boat fragment will be dried, further examined, and sent to a landfill, and the fish will be transferred to the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Richie Benaud, Australia’s former cricket captain and iconic commentator, has died at 84 after treatment for skin cancer. As a leg-spinner and captain, he played 64 Tests, led Australia unbeaten in 28 series (1958/59–1963/64), headed the first full Australian tour to India and Pakistan (1959/60), and was the first to record a Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. Inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985, he later spent over four decades with the BBC, where his concise, witty commentary—“Captaincy is 90% luck and 10% skill,” among many lines—became synonymous with cricket. Tributes poured in from Prime Minister Tony Abbott (who ordered flags at half-mast), Michael Clarke, Shane Warne, Gideon Haigh, BBC’s Jonathan Agnew, coach Darren Lehmann and international figures including Imran Khan, Kumar Sangakkara and David Cameron, all praising his authority, insight and gentlemanly character."
11356,"Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani education activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who survived a Taliban assassination attempt, has now been honored in outer space. NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer—who discovered Asteroid 316201 (2010 ML48) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in June 2010—named the roughly 4-kilometer-wide, very dark asteroid “316201 Malala.” Mainzer chose to immortalize Malala in this way partly because so few asteroids recognize the contributions of women, especially women of color. The asteroid orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter once every five and a half years. Mainzer emphasizes that educating girls worldwide is essential to tapping the full human potential needed to solve global challenges."
11366,"An explosives-laden handbag left by a woman outside the Bauchi Motor Park bus station in Gombe, northeast Nigeria, detonated around 8:30 p.m. as a bus bound for Jos was boarding passengers. The blast killed at least five people and injured around 15 more, some suffering grievous wounds such as amputated limbs and an eye gouged out. Witnesses say the woman dropped her bag by the bus, feigned waiting, then walked away before the explosion set the vehicle on fire. No group has claimed responsibility, but Boko Haram—under pressure from a four-nation regional offensive—remains the prime suspect. This was the first such attack since opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari won Nigeria’s recent presidential election."
11370,"Leaders from nearly 35 countries gathered in Panama for the Summit of the Americas, where the headline moment was President Obama’s first handshake with Cuban President Raúl Castro since announcing steps to normalize ties. Obama, mindful of past summit missteps—from the 2012 Secret Service prostitution scandal in Cartagena to being outmaneuvered by Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez in 2009—seeks a stronger U.S. showing. Washington has ceded influence in Latin America to China, Russia and Iran, even as millions of Latin Americans live in the United States and shared democratic and economic interests offer a natural basis for renewed partnership.

Obama arrives with a new Cuba policy but has stirred controversy by approving modest sanctions on Venezuela, giving President Nicolás Maduro fresh anti-U.S. rhetoric. Across the region, democratic norms are under strain—opposition figures jailed, press freedoms curtailed and corruption rife. The administration’s best course, the passage argues, is to articulate a clear vision—championing democracy, human rights, rule of law and economic growth—and to demonstrate tangible U.S. partnership in improving people’s lives. If successful, that legacy will outlast a single historic handshake."
11384,"The author begins by recalling how, at 13, she was groped on a crowded Mumbai train and kept silent about it for 25 years. She then describes how sexual harassment in India—ranging from groping, stalking and non-consensual photography to ogling and catcalling—is pervasive, especially in crowded public spaces. A “We the People” study found that 80% of women in Mumbai have been street-harassed. Many women adapt by changing their clothes, routes or schedules, yet very few report incidents: out of 2,000 workshop attendees, fewer than ten had ever gone to the authorities. Cultural pressures—fear of family “dishonor” and police mishandling—discourage reporting, despite laws against public and workplace sexual violence. Over the past two years, the author has urged women to speak up, noting two high-profile cases (Rajendra Pachauri and Tarun Tejpal) where women’s complaints led to real consequences for powerful men. She argues that breaking the silence is the first step toward ending the daily normalization of harassment and empowering all women."
11395,"Mountaineers have returned to Everest this season after last year’s deadliest-ever incident on April 18, 2014, when an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall killed 16 Nepali Sherpas. In response, Nepal’s climbing committee—led by Sherpas—has rerouted teams through a longer but safer central path in the icefall, which requires crossing more crevasses and using extra ladders, and has imposed gear-weight limits to protect the ladders. Nepal issued 347 summit permits this year, up slightly from 334 in 2013. Meanwhile, some operators, notably Alpenglow Expeditions, are shifting to the northern (Chinese) route—where 320 climbers are registered, a 136-person increase—because it lacks an icefall. Nepali guides, whose livelihoods depend on Everest tourism, worry that growing use of the Tibetan side will divert clients and income away from Nepal. Many Sherpas and repeat climbers, still coping with last season’s trauma, are nonetheless pressing on toward the summit."
11400,"April’s reputation as tax month is shifting toward “Get Tested Month,” driven by voices like Mark Cuban urging quarterly blood panels, Taylor Swift promoting screenings after her mother’s cancer, and Arizona’s new law letting anyone order lab tests without a doctor. Over half the states now permit direct-to-consumer testing, and franchises like Any Lab Test Now are booming. While diagnostic advances are vital for sick patients, applying them to healthy people unleashes a cascade of false alarms—abnormal results are common in well individuals—leading to anxiety, extra doctor visits, painful procedures, costly follow-up tests, and treatment of conditions that would never have caused harm.

As biotech firms race to market DNA sequencing, immune-system monitors, breath-analysis apps, even breast-cancer–detecting bras, the promise of “empowerment through information” risks becoming “snake-oil testing.” Lower per-test prices will be offset by dramatically higher testing volumes and ensuing medical care, raising premiums and out-of-pocket costs. The author argues for regulation and public education: people must understand that more data doesn’t always mean better health, and that freedom to test should be balanced by knowledge of its pitfalls."
11410,"Canadian CF-18 Hornets conducted their first airstrike against an ISIS garrison in Syria near Raqqa, marking Canada’s expansion of air operations beyond Iraq, where its jets have carried out dozens of strikes since November. The Department of National Defence called the raid successful, and all aircraft and crews returned safely, though casualty figures remain unknown. Prime Minister Stephen Harper authorized the Syria mission last month; Defence Minister Jason Kenney said it demonstrates Canada’s resolve to combat the “genocidal” terrorist group and deny it safe haven. The strike is part of a broader U.S.-led coalition effort, with other Western and Middle Eastern states contributing militarily or with support. CNN’s Tina Burnside contributed to this report."
11768,"A Houston couple, Danielle and Adam Busby, welcomed the world’s first all-female quintuplets since 1969 on April 8, delivered by C-section at 28 weeks and two days at the Woman’s Hospital of Texas. Big sister Blayke joins newborns Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige in their family of eight. Danielle, who became pregnant via intrauterine insemination, and Adam are chronicling life with five newborns on their blog, “It’s a Buzz World.” Though early reports hailed them as the U.S.’s first all-girl quintuplets, 1959 news clippings show a previous set in San Antonio, all of whom sadly died within 24 hours.  
In Florida, Sharon and Korey Rademacher kept not only their baby’s gender secret but also the fact that Sharon was carrying twins. When they revealed daughters Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith to family at West Florida Hospital on March 11, relatives’ reactions were filmed and uploaded to YouTube, where it has garnered over 700,000 views."
11779,"The Justice Department has revised its no-fly list procedures following a federal judge’s June ruling that the previous process violated the Fifth Amendment. Under the new policy—implemented via enhancements to the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program—U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who learn they’ve been denied boarding will be told they are on the no-fly list and may request further details. In response, the government will provide a more detailed (and, where feasible, unclassified) summary of the specific criteria used to place them on the list. Affected individuals can then submit written challenges with supporting evidence and will receive a final written decision from the TSA. These changes stem from an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of 13 Americans, but the ACLU argues the revamped redress process still lacks meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing, and plans to continue its legal challenge."
11791,"A Texas veterinarian, Dr. Kristen Lindsey, ignited public outrage after she shot an orange tabby in the head with an arrow, posted a smiling photo of herself dangling the cat by its shaft on Facebook, and bragged, “My first bow kill, lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through it’s head!” Callers flooded Washington County Animal Clinic—where Lindsey worked—to complain, crashing its website, and an animal rescuer later claimed the cat was actually a pet named Tiger (a claim CNN could not confirm).

Despite Lindsey’s boast that she wouldn’t lose her job, the clinic swiftly fired her, covered her name with duct tape on its marquee, and publicly distanced itself from her actions. Lindsey removed the post, shut down her Facebook page, and became the focus of an Austin County sheriff’s investigation; she could face animal‐cruelty charges. Animal-rights group Alley Cat Allies is offering a $7,500 reward for evidence leading to an arrest and conviction, while some community members have rallied in her defense, praising her veterinary work and dismissing the Facebook post as a poor judgment call."
11795,"A video from CNN affiliate WMAR shows a mother in light blue jeans, a yellow lace tunic and cropped yellow jacket dragging her masked son away from a crowd during the Baltimore riots, smacking him on the head and shouting as he tries to flee. WMAR reports she recognized him on TV throwing rocks at police; his face is later revealed, and he’s wearing dark pants, a black hoodie and backpack. Though her name is unknown, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts publicly praised her, saying he wished more parents would “take charge” of their children in such situations."
11808,"Outlying villages east of Kathmandu, like Ravi Opi in Kavre District, lie 30 km from the capital but take nearly two hours to reach on badly cracked, partially repaired roads. There, 90 percent of homes are now uninhabitable and residents too fearful of aftershocks to return indoors. Farmers clear rubble by hand, tend their fields and cook outdoors amid makeshift shelters—government or international aid has yet to arrive. In Ravi Opi:  
• 62-year-old Maili Tamang sits wounded beside the ruins of her two-story home, one of the few larger houses in the area, which collapsed during the quake. She and her daughter-in-law narrowly escaped, the younger woman later treated at a missionary hospital 12 km away.  
• 31-year-old Mahesh Koiraba lost his two-year-old daughter when their house fell; all he has left is her photo on his phone.  
As rain and continuing aftershocks batter the region, displaced families worry about food, shelter and how long relief will take to reach even more remote communities."
11817,"Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) surprised “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon with a musical turn, performing an Ed Sheeran parody at the piano to prove he’s more than just an archer. In a reworked “Thinking Out Loud,” he boasts of secret talents—collecting scarves and berets, playing the trombone, even opening pickle jars—before admitting Thor would still beat him in a fight. Renner, who plays the “Avengers” hero, has also starred in The Hurt Locker, American Hustle and entries in the Bourne and Mission Impossible franchises."
11821,"Director Bryan Singer has confirmed via Instagram that Olivia Munn will join the cast of X-Men: Apocalypse as telepathic mutant Psylocke (Betsy Braddock). The film—currently in production—opens May 27, 2016, and also stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence. Psylocke was created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe for Marvel’s Captain Britain comics in the 1970s–’80s and first appeared with the X-Men in 1987’s Uncanny X-Men No. 213. Munn is represented by Creative Artists Agency and Atlas Artists."
11826,"Stephen Hawking has teamed up with Monty Python to re-record their 1983 “Galaxy Song” from The Meaning of Life as a 7-inch single for Record Store Day. In the new video, scientist Brian Cox critiques the song’s astronomy before Hawking—seated in his ALS-powered wheelchair—knocks him over and delivers the tune in his computerized voice, then launches into a surreal cosmic sequence drawn from Monty Python’s live show routines. Originally written by Eric Idle and John Du Prez as an “informative lecture on the enormity of the Universe,” the Hawking version is now available for download. He previously appeared on Pink Floyd’s “Talkin’ Hawkin.’”"
11838,"The author begins by recalling, at age 12, attending the 1980 Miami demonstration and subsequent riot that followed the acquittal of four officers in the fatal beating of Arthur McDuffie.  She ties that outbreak of violence to earlier “race riots” of the 1960s—Watts (1965), Newark and Detroit (1967)—which were likewise sparked by perceived unjust police actions, and to later disturbances in Los Angeles (1992) and Baltimore (2015).  

Raised by civil-rights leaders who believed in the power of nonviolent youth activism, she reflects on her childhood fear that rioting would only undermine legitimate grievances.  Two months earlier she moderated a panel on “Riot – The Voice of the Unheard?” where she learned that participants often feel dehumanized, that past riots did help force legislative and policy changes, and that important but uncomfortable parts of this history—such as the Kerner Commission after 1967 and the Christopher Commission after Rodney King—are seldom discussed today.  

Quoting Martin Luther King Jr.’s idea that “a riot is the language of the unheard,” she draws parallels between youths in Baltimore plotting a “Purge”-style uprising and her own childhood realization of what “acquittal” means.  She notes that nonviolent protest in Ferguson after Michael Brown’s death led not to panic but to a Justice Department report revealing systemic bias and to concrete reform recommendations.  

In closing, she contrasts the quashing of the Baltimore riots with the ongoing impact of nonviolent voices demanding change, underscoring the need to address the root causes—racism, poverty, unequal education and policing—that repeatedly ignite civil unrest."
11839,"The Israeli military carried out airstrikes Sunday night in the occupied Golan Heights after four armed militants crossed in from Syria carrying an explosive device intended to target IDF forces. The strikes—conducted before the bomb could be detonated—killed three of the attackers; their group affiliation remains unknown. The Golan Heights, home to about 41,000 residents (Jews, Druze and Alawites), was captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab–Israeli war and later annexed by Israel, though it is internationally considered occupied territory."
11840,"The passage describes the viral “Cheryl’s birthday” logic puzzle from Singapore. Originally posed by TV host Kenneth Kong on Facebook and used in the April 8 Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad, it asks readers to deduce Cheryl’s one true birthday from a list of ten possible dates—May 15, May 16, May 19; June 17, June 18; July 14, July 16; August 14, August 15, and August 17—using only a short dialogue between two friends, Albert and Bernard. Georgia Tech mathematician Matt Baker provides one solution in a video, and both the New York Times and the Washington Post have published their own explanations, alongside numerous other takes found online."
11858,"A severe HIV outbreak linked to IV use of the prescription opioid Opana has struck rural Scott and Jackson counties in Indiana since mid-December. The CDC reports 142 positive HIV tests (136 confirmed, six preliminary) in an area of only a few thousand people. Scott County, the epicenter, has just one infectious-disease doctor, none of whom specialize in HIV. In March, Indiana declared a public-health emergency, and Indiana University sent volunteers to run a weekly clinic—33 patients have been seen so far—and to conduct door-to-door needle-safety education. Governor Mike Pence issued and twice extended a 30-day executive order allowing needle exchanges, and the state is also offering job services.  
Dr. Jonathan Mermin of the CDC notes many newly infected are too young to remember HIV’s 1980s peak, and says education is crucial. Dr. Joan Duwve of the Indiana Health Department attributes rapid spread to generational, community drug use along the Ohio River, frequent daily injections of Opana, needle sharing, and larger-gauge needles that heighten blood exposure. With hepatitis C up 150% from 2010–2013 among injectors, officials warn this outbreak underscores the need for ongoing vigilance."
11860,"Leslie Morris, a friend of more than 44 years, has filed an April 28 petition to be named conservator for singer‐songwriter Joni Mitchell, who was found unconscious at home a month ago and remains hospitalized at UCLA Medical Center. In court papers, Morris asserts Mitchell is still unconscious and unable to meet her personal needs. Yet a statement posted the same day on Mitchell’s official website—approved by Morris—says Mitchell is alert, fully comprehends her surroundings and is expected to recover, with the conservatorship merely authorizing Morris to oversee her care after discharge. Publicist Alisse Kingsley confirmed the website’s account is accurate. A doctor’s declaration warns Mitchell likely can’t attend any court hearings for four to six months. Meanwhile, fans are leaving tributes at WeLoveYouJoni.com. Reporters Sonya Hamasaki and Cheri Mossburg contributed to this report."
11870,"A new book, Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer, alleges that foreign governments and businesses donated to Clinton family charities hoping to influence Hillary Clinton as secretary of state.  Examples include contributions from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Canada’s foreign affairs department—around the same time State endorsed the Keystone XL pipeline—and sponsorships by banks under government investigation at the Clinton Global Initiative’s annual meeting.  Critics say there’s no clear proof of quid pro quo or that the Clintons knew about the donors’ legal troubles.  Separately, the Clinton charities have suffered chronic deficits (a $40 million shortfall in 2007–08 and $8 million in 2012), internal management battles and even a high-profile scam by Raffaello Follieri.  Unless Schweizer uncovers new blockbuster evidence, these issues are likely to be treated as “distractions” alongside Hillary Clinton’s email controversy—especially since polls show most voters remain focused on jobs and the economy, with 57 percent expecting her to win in 2016."
11875,"Andrew Lesnie, the 59-year-old Oscar-winning Australian cinematographer best known for his decade-long collaboration with Peter Jackson on The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit franchises, died Monday of a heart attack.  A Sydney native, he also shot Jackson’s King Kong (2005) and The Lovely Bones (2009), and recently completed Russell Crowe’s directorial debut, The Water Diviner, which opened in U.S. theaters the same week.  

Lesnie won his Academy Award for The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), after Jackson enlisted him—having admired his use of natural light and backlighting in the Australian hits Babe (1995) and its 1998 sequel.  His other credits include Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), I Am Legend (2007), The Last Airbender (2010) and Healing (2014).  

He was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002.  Lesnie studied film and television at TAFE and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, began his career at the Australian Broadcasting Corp. as a camera assistant, and honed his skills on low-budget shorts, music videos, documentaries, commercials and the children’s magazine show Wonder World.  "
11877,"For the fifth consecutive year in 2014, ambush attacks were the leading cause of on-duty felonious deaths among U.S. law enforcement officers. Meanwhile, Google’s Waze app—acquired in 2013—uses GPS and crowdsourcing to let its 50 million users mark the real-time locations of police (“traffic cop” feature) as “visible” or “invisible.” Although most drivers use it to dodge traffic tickets, the app has been used by criminals—most notably Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who located New York officers Ramos and Liu via Waze before assassinating them.  

Law enforcement groups warn that Waze endangers officers executing arrests, traffic stops, domestic-violence calls and other duties, and also aids drunk drivers, speeders, gang members, narcotics dealers and potential terrorists. Despite its public commitment to corporate responsibility and a stated mission of serving the “common good,” Google has declined to meet with the National Sheriffs’ Association to address these risks. Police leaders insist that protecting both motorists and officers is compatible and urge Google to work with them to safeguard communities."
11888,"Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe’s “Toy Soldiers” project tackles the desensitization to war imagery by staging Polisario Front fighters in the Western Sahara desert as if they were green plastic toy soldiers. Drawing on his landscape photography background, Thorpe chose historic battle sites between Morocco and the Polisario Front—locked in conflict since the mid-1970s and under a ceasefire since 1991—and positioned 50–60 real troops at a time on platforms made from old oil drums. Working long autumn days under the desert sun, he used a wide-angle lens from sandy heights to create a visual metaphor that compels viewers to realize these are living soldiers, not toys. Thorpe hopes the series, shot over five weeks with careful military and UN clearance, will provoke new reflection on how we consume images of war. His “Toy Soldiers” book is now available for pre-order from Dewi Lewis Publishing."
11900,"A gunman entered a third‐floor campus building at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina, on Monday, fatally shooting print shop operator Ron Lane, a longtime employee. The college was placed on lockdown, all buildings were cleared, and authorities say the isolated incident was not random. The suspect, 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III—a former student who once worked for Lane—is still at large and described by police as “armed and dangerous.” During the sweep, deputies mistakenly deployed tear gas in a restroom, but the occupant was not the suspect.

College President Kay Albertson called it “a sad day” and praised the rapid multi‐agency response. Wayne Community College, a two-year institution with 3,837 students in fall 2013 (just over half part-time), had reported no major violent crimes from 2011 to 2013, though there were three weapons-possession arrests in each of 2012 and 2013."
11908,"Colorado’s New Belgium Brewery and Ben & Jerry’s are teaming up to create a salted-caramel-brownie ice-cream–inspired beer this fall. Both certified B Corporations with long histories of social and environmental activism, they say the collaboration will raise awareness around issues they care about. Details of the joint campaign will be announced later in the year; Ben & Jerry’s marketing manager promises it will be “impactful.” New Belgium champions sustainable agriculture and climate initiatives, while Ben & Jerry’s supports environmental causes, fair trade and marriage equality. (Ben & Jerry’s cofounder has also floated the idea of marijuana-infused ice cream, but there’s no beer-flavored ice cream on the menu—yet.)"
11910,"In Indianapolis, Wisconsin upended Kentucky’s bid for a perfect season, rallying from a 60–56 deficit with 6½ minutes left to win 71–64 in the Final Four. Frank Kaminsky paced the Badgers with 20 points and 11 rebounds; Sam Dekker added 16. Kentucky, the first men’s team ever to start 38–0, was held scoreless for the game’s final five minutes despite 16 points from freshman Karl-Anthony Towns and 13 and 12 from the Harrison twins. Wisconsin’s decisive 8–0 run, plus a 12‐rebound edge, proved the difference.

Earlier, Duke beat Michigan State 81–61 to set up Monday’s title game with Wisconsin. Freshman Justise Winslow led Duke with 19 points; Jahlil Okafor had 18 (10 in the first half) and Quinn Cook chipped in 17. Michigan State’s Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds, but after an early 8–0 start the Spartans managed just three baskets over the closing 16 minutes of the first half. Duke’s strong defense and inside scoring transformed a nine‐point halftime lead into a 20‐point cushion, sealing the win. If Duke triumphs Monday, it would claim its fifth NCAA crown."
11911,"Saudi Arabia’s air campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen resumed midweek despite announcing the end of “Operation Decisive Storm” and the launch of “Operation Renewal of Hope,” which is officially focused on political talks. Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam called for peace negotiations only after a full halt to Saudi strikes. The previous UN-backed talks collapsed in January when rebels attacked President Hadi’s residence in Sanaa. Security sources in Taiz reported five airstrikes on a weapons depot following a rebel attack on a Yemeni army brigade.  

Meanwhile, the Houthis released Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi—detained since March—after UN demands for his freedom. Saudi officials claim their campaign has degraded Houthi infrastructure in Sanaa, achieved key UN demands (including the exile of ex-President Saleh), and aims next to protect civilians, bolster humanitarian aid, counter terrorism and secure maritime routes. President Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, vowed to rebuild Yemen’s institutions and military once the Houthis withdraw.  

Separately, U.S. drone strikes in Mukalla have killed a total of 12 al-Qaeda suspects over two attacks this week, while U.S. ships conduct reconnaissance to ensure freedom of navigation in the region."
11922,"Falih Essawi, deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, says ISIS militants are mounting a major offensive on Ramadi, the capital of Iraq’s Anbar province, about 70 miles west of Baghdad. Fierce fighting has seen ISIS seize northern and southern approaches over the past months and make significant advances Wednesday in Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem and parts of Soufia east of the city, with militants reportedly entering central Ramadi. Government forces now hold only western positions and appear on the verge of collapse; Essawi, at a frontline with a machine gun, has begged Baghdad for reinforcements and the U.S.-led coalition for urgent air support. On Wednesday, at least 10 Iraqi security personnel were killed and more than 100 wounded. The assault has driven at least 150,000 residents to flee—many on foot or in carts—leaving homes occupied by ISIS snipers, as recounted by displaced families from Albu Ghanem. Despite seven U.S.-led airstrikes near Ramadi since Monday, the city remains contested; a U.S. military official says its fall is “not imminent” but acknowledges extensive ISIS control amid a months-long tug of war."
11932,"The passage marks April 14 as Equal Pay Day—the point when women’s average annual earnings finally catch up to men’s from the previous year—highlighting that women earn just 77 cents for every dollar men earn (even less for women of color). It notes that over a 40-year career, a woman loses about $431,000 to this gap, and that closing it would lift many single mothers out of poverty and boost the broader economy. Arguing that Hillary Clinton’s populist campaign image is undercut by her wealth, the author urges her to take a 23 percent pay cut—from $400,000 to about $308,000—as a symbolic political stunt until the wage gap disappears. Though theatrical, such a gesture would powerfully demonstrate solidarity with working women and underscore her commitment to fixing inequality."
11945,"Extremist Islamist groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram combine medieval cruelty with modern technology not only to conquer territory but to build a “caliphate” governed by their harsh interpretation of seventh-century Sharia law. Central to this strategy is the systematic capture, enslavement, sexual assault and forced marriage of women—both non-Muslims (notably Yazidis held in slave-warehouses and sold or distributed to fighters) and Muslim women in occupied cities like Mosul. Human Rights Watch and medical examinations confirm organized rape and sexual slavery, which these groups defend as religiously sanctioned. Boko Haram’s abduction of some 2,000 women and girls since 2014—including the 276 Chibok students—is driven by the same goal: to supply brides, laborers and child-bearers for their emerging society. Unlike earlier jihadis who deferred social-state building, today’s extremists methodically subjugate women as indispensable components of the communities they seek to establish, enforcing controls so severe many captives have attempted suicide."
11948,"SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, plans to attempt the first upright landing of a rocket’s first stage on an ocean-going “autonomous spaceport drone ship.” A Monday launch of its two‐stage Falcon 9 carrying the uncrewed Dragon cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station was scrubbed by weather; the next try is set for Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral. After Dragon is delivered into orbit by the Falcon 9’s upper stage—which then breaks away and burns up on reentry—SpaceX will guide the booster back to the Atlantic Ocean platform. Musk hopes to reuse rockets “just like airplanes” to cut launch costs up to 100-fold. In January a similar landing attempt ended in a crash, and SpaceX estimates its odds of success at about 50 percent. The company will share photos and video of the mission online and vows to keep trying, eventually aiming to land boosters on land. Dragon will dock at the ISS a few days after launch with over 4,300 lb of supplies—including an espresso maker—then, after five weeks of unloading and loading more than 3,000 lb of experiments and trash, will return to Earth for a Pacific Ocean splashdown off California. This is SpaceX’s sixth ISS mission and follows its distinction as the first private contractor to dock there."
11979,"Jurors in the trial of 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, accused of planting pressure-cooker bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon, have deliberated over seven hours without reaching a verdict and will resume Wednesday. Prosecutors presented harrowing video and photographic evidence of the April 15 blasts that killed three spectators—including 8-year-old Martin Richard and 23-year-old Lingzi Lu—and maimed dozens more, arguing Tsarnaev “chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston” to terrorize civilians and “awake the mujahedeen.” They traced the homemade devices—pressure cookers filled with explosive powder, nails and BBs—to purchases linked to Tsarnaev and his late brother, Tamerlan, alleging the pair saw themselves as soldiers in a jihad against America.

Defense attorney Judy Clarke acknowledged her client’s role but argued that 26-year-old Tamerlan, killed in a shootout days after the bombings, was the mastermind and that Dzhokhar merely followed him. Tsarnaev faces 30 counts—including 17 that carry the death penalty or life imprisonment—and, if convicted on any capital count, the trial will enter a penalty phase weighing aggravating factors against his personal history and mental health. Federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses; the defense has called four."
12008,"Millennials are rethinking marriage, often delaying or forgoing it in favor of education, careers, travel and financial stability. In conversations with 21-year-olds at Kent State, the author found students who’d rather spend money on a degree or Europe than a wedding, believe you don’t need a ring to prove love, and fear unhappy unions more than lifelong singlehood. Their attitudes reflect broader U.S. trends: rising repeat marriages (23% of currently married adults have been married before, up from 13% in 1960) and a 2010 Pew survey showing half of Americans accept priorities beyond marriage and children, especially ages 18–29. Religious leaders worry about morality; economists cite links between marriage and well-being, though causality is unclear. Millennials themselves want debt-free partners and hesitate to marry while burdened by student loans. In Scandinavia—where cohabitation and out-of-wedlock births predominate—marriage is seen as costly and unnecessary, yet countries like Norway and Sweden top quality-of-life rankings. Ultimately, the author—once skeptical herself but now happily married—asks whether a mostly single society could be just as well off as one built on “I dos.”"
12060,"Iraqi forces, backed by some 20,000 Iranian-supported Shiite militiamen and U.S.-led airstrikes, recaptured Tikrit on Wednesday after nine months of ISIS rule. They encountered numerous booby-traps—vehicles, buildings and a massive excavator packed with explosives—and dismantled hundreds of IEDs. Troops remain cautious as a few militants hide in homes. Authorities also worry Shiite militias may exact revenge on Tikrit’s largely Sunni population for last year’s massacre of Shiite air-force cadets by ISIS, risking renewed sectarian strife. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, arriving to claim victory, hailed the defeat of ISIS there and vowed to replicate the operation elsewhere. The liberation, following fierce fighting around Saddam Hussein’s palaces, paves the way for a larger offensive on Mosul."
12068,"The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday urged an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen—particularly around the southern port city of Aden—to allow urgent delivery of food, water, medical supplies and personnel, warning that many of the newly wounded from airstrikes and ground fighting will die without care within hours. Its appeal came just before a late morning U.N. Security Council session called by Russia, which proposed halting the Saudi-led coalition’s air campaign but did not demand that Houthi rebels stop fighting or initiate political talks; the meeting ended without a decision.  
Fierce Saudi strikes have intensified in the capital, Sanaa, targeting military bases, while in Aden the coalition—backed by Saudi special forces supporting President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi’s loyalists—has driven Houthi fighters back from central areas, including the presidential palace. Since the Houthis seized Sanaa in January and forced Hadi to flee first to Aden and then to Saudi Arabia, more than 519 people have been killed and 1,700 wounded in two weeks, tens of thousands have fled to Somalia and Djibouti, and in Aden alone 58 have died and 200 been injured in the last two days.  
Complicating the conflict, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula controls much of eastern Yemen; its leader Khaled Batarfi was recently freed from jail when Islamist fighters overran al-Mukallah, and was seen in a southern presidential residence. On Saturday French forces evacuated 44 people, including French nationals, from the eastern port of Balhaf."
12073,"NYPD Detective Patrick Cherry, who holds top-secret FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force clearance, apologized after a video of him angrily confronting an Uber driver went viral. In the footage, Cherry, driving an unmarked car with lights flashing, yelled at the driver for not using his blinker, mocked his accent, accused him of “three traffic and law violations,” and threatened to arrest him. The altercation began when the driver gestured to Cherry to signal before parking. Police Commissioner William Bratton, who placed Cherry on modified assignment, condemned the behavior as unacceptable, saying it reflected poorly on the department, and apologized to the driver and passengers. Mayor Bill de Blasio also criticized discriminatory language. Michael Palladino of the Detectives’ Endowment Association defended Cherry’s character but acknowledged officers are held to a higher standard. The NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau and the Civilian Complaint Review Board are investigating, and Cherry faces possible suspension, reassignment or loss of clearance."
13806,"In the October 5 episode of Big Brother 25, Head of Household Cameron Hardin—who had also won the Power of Veto—kept Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes on the block. At eviction, all seven voting houseguests (Cory, Cirie, Blue, Matt, Jag, America and Bowie) cast their ballots against Mecole, resulting in a unanimous 7–0 vote that sent her to the jury. On her way out, Mecole urged the remaining players to target Cory and America.  

The Week 10 HOH competition involved true-or-false questions about Instagram-style photos; Bowie Jane and Felicia tied with perfect scores, but Bowie won the tiebreaker by estimating how many minutes Jared Fields was a zombie. This marks Bowie’s first HOH win. She will hold her nomination ceremony on October 6."
13814,"In January 2024, roughly 66 million Social Security beneficiaries will see their monthly retirement payments rise by 3.2% under the SSA’s annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), announced October 12, 2023. On average, retirees will receive just over $50 more per month. At the same time, the taxable earnings cap for Social Security will climb to $168,600 (up from $160,200 in 2023), reflecting annual wage-based adjustments. 

The 2024 COLA is tied to changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, tracking inflation as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Beneficiaries will get official notices in early December—or view them online via their “My Social Security” account, with text or email alerts available through November 14.  

The Senior Citizens League had forecast this 3.2% increase—higher than the 20-year average of 2.6% but below last year’s 8.7% boost—and estimated it would raise the average $1,790 monthly benefit by about $57.30. For details on 2024 Medicare changes, beneficiaries are directed to www.medicare.gov."

13816,"The article “Debunking the Hype: Xanax’s Effectiveness for Treating Anxiety” from Medical News Today offers a balanced look at alprazolam (Xanax). It explains that Xanax, a benzodiazepine, quickly boosts GABA activity in the brain to calm acute anxiety episodes, making it useful for short-term or emergency relief. However, repeated use can lead to tolerance, requiring higher doses and increasing the risk of dependence and withdrawal. For chronic anxiety, the article advises pairing any long-term Xanax regimen with therapy, lifestyle changes, or alternative medications and close medical supervision. Ultimately, it urges individuals to weigh Xanax’s immediate benefits against its limitations and to pursue a holistic, professionally guided treatment plan."
13823,"The Pentagon has confirmed that soldiers from Fort Cavazos (Killeen) and Fort Bliss (El Paso) are part of a 900-troop deployment to the Middle East aimed at protecting U.S. forces from drone and rocket fire. This surge follows at least 12 attacks in Iraq and four in Syria over the past week (plus one unsuccessful attack), which have left 21 U.S. personnel with mostly minor injuries, chiefly traumatic brain injuries. Most of the Fort Bliss contingent will staff a THAAD missile-defense battery (which requires roughly 100 soldiers), while other troops from Fort Bliss and Fort Cavazos will serve as air-defense headquarters elements. The remaining forces will support Patriot batteries from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Patriot and Avenger batteries from Fort Liberty, North Carolina. Department of Defense spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said exact locations aren’t being disclosed, the troops are not headed to Israel, and the mission is meant to strengthen regional deterrence and force protection."
13827,"Big Brother 25 spoilers say new HoH Bowie Jane is under pressure to backdoor competition-strong Cameron Hardin, whom many fear will steamroll to the end. Though Cameron’s allies Matt and Jag (together “The Fugitives”) are split—Jag wants Cameron gone, Matt does not—Bowie instead nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields, viewing both as equal threats. Cameron, meanwhile, is lobbying Bowie to target Cory Wurtrnberger, and Cory has also urged her to blindside Cameron before he wins more Head of Household comps. Bowie has ruled out putting Cameron up as a replacement nominee, but Cory continues to press. This week’s Power of Veto players are Bowie, Felicia, Cirie, Jag, Matt and America (with Cory hosting). If Bowie, Jag or Matt win POV, the nominations stay the same; if America, Cirie or Felicia win, Bowie must name a replacement and could choose Cory. The POV competition airs Saturday evening."
13829,"Cameron Hardin was “backdoored” in Week 10 of Big Brother 25—targeted after repeatedly winning competitions and failing to bond with the other houseguests, even earning Felicia Cannon’s claim that he had an “evil spirit.” Immediately after his eviction, a new HOH challenge revealed Jag Bains as Secret HOH; he quietly nominated Blue Kim and Felicia Cannon, leaving both women—and Cirie Fields—regretting Cameron’s departure. Blue in particular realized Cameron’s warning that she’d be next was spot on when she saw her own name on the block. In Week 11, a Double Veto competition promises to shake up the lineup and give Blue a shot at survival, while another eviction will soon send someone to join Cameron in the jury house. Additional notes: Big Brother 24’s Michael Bruner recently got married, Cameron gave an exit interview discussing the best and worst players, and BB25 airs Sundays (10/9c), Tuesdays (8/7c) and Thursdays (9/8c) on CBS."
13834,"Bowie Jane won her first Head of Household in Week 10 of Big Brother 25 and nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields for eviction. Jag Bains then claimed the Power of Veto in the OTEV challenge and intends to use it at the Veto Meeting on Monday, October 9. Bowie Jane plans to name her ally Cameron Hardin as the replacement nominee—potentially making him the first juror of the season—despite his advice to her earlier and a push from Cirie to spare Felicia. Meanwhile, houseguests are seeding Bowie Jane with allegations against Cameron, and a feud between Cirie and Matt Klotz adds more tension. With the Veto Meeting looming, alliances could still shift. Big Brother 25 airs on CBS, and Peacock has released the cast list for The Traitors Season 2."
13840,"New York Republican Anthony D’Esposito, joined by Nick LaLota, Marc Molinaro and Mike Lawler, has filed a privileged motion in the U.S. House to expel Rep. George Santos after 23 new federal charges, including unauthorized use of donors’ credit cards and identity theft, and allegations he fabricated much of his résumé. The motion will be voted on in the coming week, but Santos has pledged not to resign. Republican leaders, mindful of their slim 221–212 majority, could table the motion or send it to committee rather than bring it to a floor vote. Even if it reaches the floor, expulsion would require 290 votes—meaning at least 78 Republicans would have to join Democrats. The effort may therefore fail, but Santos’s ethical and legal troubles are likely to persist."
13842,"Survivor host Jeff Probst has clarified that, as of Survivor 45, no castaway may sit out two challenges in a row “period”—whoever skips one challenge must compete in the next. Previously the rule only barred consecutive sit-outs within a single cycle (it reset at Tribal Council), which became confusing after seasons were shortened from 39 to 26 days and fewer Reward Challenges meant the same people often sat out Immunity Challenges back to back. The change was driven in part by fan and cast pushback over Claire Rafson sitting out three straight Immunity Challenges in Season 44. Probst announced the simplification in Episode 2 to make the rule crystal clear for viewers.  
Additional notes: Survivor’s On Fire podcast has returned alongside Wednesday broadcasts, new episodes now run 90 minutes (a side-effect of Hollywood strikes), and eliminated players Hannah Rose and Brandon Donlon have publicly discussed their departures. Episodes stream on Paramount+ and air Wednesdays at 8/7c on CBS."

After discovering Sally still has feelings for Adam, Nick ends their relationship and demands she sort out those feelings. Torn between Nick—who’s falling in love with her—and the lingering connection she feels with Adam, Sally initially refuses to choose and even considers walking away from them both. During the week’s episodes, she and Adam become intimate, further confusing her emotions. When Nick and Adam physically clash over Sally, she breaks them up and is pressed to make a decision that will “shock” viewers."
13846,"A Rice University team has secured $45 million to develop HAMMR, a three-inch, rechargeable implant that continuously monitors tumors and adjusts immunotherapy dosing in real time via a closed-loop, wireless system (potentially smartphone-linked). By supplying precise, on-demand drug delivery, researchers aim to overcome the infrequent “snapshot” data of current diagnostics and potentially eradicate cancers in as little as 60 days. Human trials—beginning within five years—will first target recurrent ovarian cancer, with broader applications envisioned for other peritoneal tumors."
13848,"The Dolphins, fresh off a controversial loss to the Eagles, are eyeing upgrades before the trade deadline despite upcoming returns from injury to Xavien Howard, Jalen Ramsey, Connor Williams, Terron Armstead, and De’Von Achane. Their biggest need: consistent pass rush. Emmanuel Ogbah has just 2.5 sacks (down from nine in previous healthy seasons), and Christian Wilkins has under-performed. CBS’s Josina Anderson reports Miami could explore trading for Washington’s Chase Young—five years younger than their current ends and already at five sacks this year. Although acquiring Young would require negotiating a costly long-term extension and careful cap management, his addition alongside Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelen Phillips, and Bradley Chubb would markedly boost Miami’s sack production and overall defensive potency for a playoff push."
13850,"In 1988, deputies in Jenkins County, Georgia, discovered a body wrapped in plastic and duct tape inside a nylon suitcase in a dumpster north of Millen. The victim, later determined to have died of asphyxiation four to seven days earlier, remained unidentified despite fingerprints, dental‐record checks, a forensic sketch, and nationwide alerts via NAMUS and NCMEC. Although early DNA samples were too degraded for CODIS entry, in 2023 the GBI partnered with Texas‐based Othram, Inc. for advanced genealogical testing—funded by “Project Justice”—which pinpointed the remains as those of 26-year-old Chong Un Kim, a Korean immigrant who lived in Hinesville.

When the cameras returned late Thursday, Matt was revealed as HOH for the first time this season. He’ll nominate two players for eviction on Friday, with everyone vying for the Power of Veto to shake up his pair of nominees.

13874,"China has launched its first nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines, giving its navy the ability to conduct long-range precision strikes against land targets and significantly boosting its power-projection. This move echoes Cold War Soviet efforts to threaten U.S. carriers and comes amid U.S. worries over a possible Chinese invasion of Taiwan and other regional conflicts that could distract Washington. A recent Pentagon report also warns China plans to increase its deployed nuclear warheads from about 500 today to nearly 1,000 by 2030, build over 300 new ICBM silos, and may develop conventionally armed intercontinental missiles capable of striking the U.S. Meanwhile, China’s navy—already the world’s largest at some 370 ships and submarines—is expected to grow to 435 by 2030, underscoring the seriousness of its simulated attacks and rhetoric against Taiwan."

13894,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration after U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents cut through concertina wire Texas had installed along the southern border. On October 30, U.S. District Judge Alia Moses—an appointee of President George W. Bush—granted Paxton’s request for a temporary restraining order barring federal agents from removing or damaging the barrier, with an exception for medical emergencies that risk serious injury or death if no lifesaving equipment is available. The order remains in effect until November 13, and both sides will present full arguments on November 7. Paxton said the injunction was secured by swift legal action, while the Department of Homeland Security maintains the wire was cut to provide medical aid and fulfill its duty to process unauthorized border crossers."
13895,"Illinois Senate President Don Harmon is under scrutiny for backing a Cook County property-tax overhaul that would reclassify private, for-profit nursing homes from commercial to residential status—dramatically reducing their tax bills. Critics note Harmon’s receipt of nearly $2 million in contributions from the Health Care Council of Illinois, the industry’s PAC, including over $700,000 in the past year (notably $100,000 on September 30). Harmon has not publicly addressed the donations or his support for the measure; his spokesman insists decisions are made in the public interest. Health Care Council policy director Ron Nunziato defends Harmon’s longstanding nursing-home advocacy and denies any payoff. The reclassification provision, introduced by State Senator Celina Villanueva and drafted in part by Harmon’s staff, narrowly passed the General Assembly but was excised by Governor J.B. Pritzker’s amendatory veto, citing unfair tax shifts onto homeowners and small businesses. Nursing-home interests now push for a veto override, reportedly backed by Harmon’s chief of staff, Jacob Butcher."

13916,"A Georgia Dollar General employee was fired immediately after informing her manager of her September 2020 pregnancy. Her separation notice cited “health reasons,” despite her assurance that she could continue working. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Dollar General for pregnancy discrimination and secured a $42,500 settlement. The EEOC stresses that pregnancy cannot be assumed to impair job performance and enforces federal protections—such as the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act—to prevent such stereotypes and ensure equal treatment for pregnant employees."

The cuts, which affect popular destinations like Burlington, Miami, Nashville and Washington, DC, stem from the dissolution of its 2021 Northeast Alliance with American Airlines and ongoing government ATC staffing shortages. Passengers booked on any of the canceled flights will be offered alternative routings or full refunds."
13925,"A former FBI agent and a Washington, D.C., real estate developer were sentenced for running a bribery scheme that trafficked in confidential Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) information from the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development.  
• Defendants  
  – David Paitsel, 42, ex-FBI special agent: received 24 months’ prison (concurrent), 24 months’ supervised release, a $100 special assessment and $10,600 forfeiture. He used his FBI access to obtain tenant contact data.

13926,"Governor Josh Shapiro’s office recently paid $295,000 to settle a sexual-harassment claim against Mike Vereb, the governor’s former secretary of legislative affairs. A former employee accused Vereb of lewd and misogynistic remarks and alleged retaliation after she spoke up. Vereb resigned, and in early September the settlement was finalized and—following an open records request—made public last month. Of the total, $196,365 went to the complainant and over $49,000 to legal fees. Under the agreement, the governor’s office will provide sexual-harassment training to all Policy and Legislative Affairs staff and permit the complainant to seek other state or contracted employment.

13933,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a press release on October 9 condemning the recent terrorist attacks on Israel and pledging support for Israelis, American citizens there, and Texas’s Jewish community. He directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to assist local partners who might face retaliatory attacks—potentially by Hezbollah or Hamas—and barred all state agencies from buying or exporting goods to the Gaza Strip that could benefit Hamas. Abbott also allocated $4 million in grants to 31 Jewish organizations for security upgrades, ordered the Texas flag flown at half-staff through Saturday for conflict victims, and posted an executive order supporting Israel on X.

Participating phones, radios and TVs will display “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed,” with a Spanish version reading “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA… No se necesita acción.” The familiar 1963 audio tone—established under President Kennedy and used by some 1,700 local and tribal authorities—will accompany the message. These tri-annual tests (last held Aug. 11, 2021) help FEMA assess system performance; if weather interferes, it may be moved to Oct. 11. Most devices will receive it unless they’re off, in airplane mode, out of coverage or are older models, especially if in use. The FCC has warned against misuse of Emergency Alert tones, recently proposing a fine for FOX’s improper use. Remember, when you hear the tone, it’s only a test."

Because the CME arrived with slower solar winds and no pronounced spike, many aurora watchers missed the forecast; instead, observers noted only a brief satellite data gap, a subtle rise in solar wind speed and a gradual negative Bz shift aligning with Earth’s magnetic field. Aurora enthusiast Charlie Bourdo anticipated these subtle signals hours before the event and has since released a “How to Forecast Northern Lights” video.

Eddie Morales, whose district includes high-traffic crossing points in El Paso, Del Rio and Eagle Pass, told Fox 4’s Steven Dial that President Biden’s recent immigration measures haven’t done enough to help border states. Citing nearly 2.3 million migrant encounters last fiscal year and numbers nearly as high so far this year, Morales proposed charging each migrant a $2,000 “initial processing fee” to enter the U.S. in exchange for a non-voting RFID ID card that could double as a credit card. He suggested the fee could raise about $3.2 million per day (over $1.2 billion a year) just in the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector. Morales also floated formal “workforce agreements” between Texas and Mexican governors to send vetted laborers north for seasonal jobs, calling the plan a “win-win” for migrants, employers and the state."

He nominated Blue Kim and America Lopez, privately declaring to Matt Klotz that he won’t save either nominee so Blue will be evicted. All HouseGuests except Cirie Fields played in the POV; Jag’s win means nominations stand. Blue is scrambling for votes, but with Bowie Jane, Matt and likely Felicia Cannon aligned against her, Jag only needs one more vote to finish the job (Cirie is expected to vote to keep Blue). A double eviction looms next, and Jag can’t compete in that HOH—Matt must win to shield him.

15777,"Most airline pilots pride themselves on strict structure in the cockpit and can compartmentalize personal stress. Depression, once a career-ender, is now treatable and—under FAA rules—even medicated pilots may continue flying until recovered.  
   
The author examines how Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who harbored serious psychiatric issues beyond clinical depression, slipped through multiple screening layers:  
• Glider-club participation, where odd behaviors tend to surface in a close-knit environment, went unremarked.  
• A highly competitive selection for Lufthansa’s ab initio MPL program in Arizona—250 hours of intense, unpaid, supervised training—yielded no red flags despite Lubitz’s uncharacteristic leave of absence.  
• Subsequent Airbus A320 type-rating in Germany also failed to alert instructors or peers, even though Lubitz had disclosed a prior depression diagnosis.  

Finally, the author notes that Germanwings pilots faced lower pay, longer duty days, and strained industrial relations—stressors that may have compounded Lubitz’s illness. In hindsight, multiple opportunities existed to detect and address his condition. The tragedy of Flight 9525 underscores the need for more vigilant mental-health screening so that “an accident waiting to happen” can be prevented."
15782,"Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a 23-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Columbus, Ohio, pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI. According to the indictment, Mohamud traveled to Syria in April 2014—buying a one-way ticket to Greece with a layover in Istanbul, then diverting to Syria—where he trained in weapons use, explosives, breaking into homes and hand-to-hand combat. Prosecutors say a cleric then directed him to return to the United States to carry out a terrorist act.

Back home, Mohamud allegedly told associates he planned to kill U.S. soldiers “execution style,” targeting a military base in Texas or, failing that, a prison, and also discussed attacking police or other uniformed personnel. He expressed approval of his brother Aden’s death fighting for al-Nusra Front in Syria and said he intended to join him in death. Mohamud became a U.S. citizen in February 2014 and was remanded into custody after his arraignment; his lawyer, Sam Shamansky, vowed a vigorous defense."
15784,"Sheriff Stanley Glanz said he has reassigned two deputies involved in the April 2 arrest attempt of Eric Harris in Tulsa after they and their families began receiving threats. Although the deputies—who have not been charged—were criticized for pinning Harris’s head to the pavement as he gasped, “I’m losing my breath,” officers on video can be heard replying, “F*ck your breath.” The agency’s drug unit has been temporarily suspended while the shooting is reviewed, but Glanz said any further action against the deputies will await the outcome of the criminal case against Reserve Deputy Robert Bates. Bates, 73, is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris’s death, maintains the shooting was accidental, and is free on $25,000 bond. Allegations that Bates’s training records were forged were denied by Glanz, who affirmed Bates met all qualification standards. Glanz apologized to Harris’s family, noted that an FBI probe found no civil-rights violations, and has hired a Dallas police consultant to reexamine department policies. Harris’s family insists the incident reflects “a deep-seated problem” in the department and demands justice and policy reform."

11365,"Since Saudi Arabia and eight partner nations began airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels on March 26, they have carried out about 1,200 raids and, according to the Saudi Defense Ministry, killed more than 500 fighters. The campaign is intended to halt Houthi advances toward southern Yemen. On Friday near the Najran border region, Houthi mortar fire hit a Saudi site; Saudi forces returned fire, and three Saudi officers were killed and two wounded. Yemen’s Health Ministry says 385 civilians have died and 342 been injured in the wider conflict; the World Health Organization, counting militants as well, puts the toll at 648 dead and 2,191 wounded. Yemen has been destabilized since Houthi rebels ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi in January, and even before this latest escalation, the U.N. estimated that most of the country’s 25 million people needed humanitarian aid."

Finn was convicted in 2012 of failing to report suspected child abuse by priest Shawn Ratigan, received two years’ probation (no jail time or fine), and remained in office until now. The case drew criticism—most notably from Cardinal Sean O’Malley—and highlighted delays in reporting abuse. Archbishop Joseph Naumann has been named apostolic administrator until a permanent bishop is appointed. Advocates and scholars say this step may help restore confidence but urge more explicit, systemic accountability tied to children’s safety."

• The UK overseas territory, with help from RIBA, has launched an international design competition to upgrade aging infrastructure and boost self-sustainability ahead of its 200th anniversary in 2016.  
• Planners seek architects experienced in renewable energy for remote areas, modern housing and cost-effective agriculture to enhance energy efficiency, reduce fossil-fuel dependence and cut imports.  
• Existing buildings are small bungalows of concrete and volcanic rock with minimal insulation; internet and renewable-power systems are limited.  
• Tristan is accessible only 60 days a year via a small port at Edinburgh of the Seven Seas; cargo capacity is restricted, raising logistics challenges for materials and construction.  
• The territory comprises four islands—populated Tristan, nearby Nightingale and Inaccessible, and remote Gough (both UNESCO sites). Cape Town is the nearest mainland port, seven days and 1,750 miles away.  
• Local amenities include a pub, shop, café, dance hall, museum, church, swimming pool, a small school (30 pupils), two expat doctors and two Tristanian nurses.  
• The economy relies on lobster fishing for global export, plus sales of stamps, coins, souvenirs and modest tourism; residents grow fish, livestock and potatoes for self-sufficiency.

2. Hillary Clinton has leased Brooklyn campaign headquarters and will soon formally launch her bid with a reintroduction that spotlights her suburban Chicago childhood, early work with the Legal Services Corporation and Children’s Defense Fund, and her Arkansas–era education advocacy. Her team will be larger than expected, with an emphasis on small, personal events.

Al Qaeda publicly held him, demanding that the U.S. halt airstrikes in Pakistan. Despite repeated calls for his release, the U.S. government refused to negotiate. Suffering from heart disease and asthma, Weinstein appeared gaunt in a Christmas 2013 video pleading for help. In January of this year, a U.S. drone strike on an al Qaeda compound along the Afghanistan–Pakistan border accidentally killed him and Italian hostage Giovanni Lo Porto. President Obama mourned Weinstein’s “lifelong dedication to service” as a Peace Corps volunteer and USAID contractor.

11871,"Corinthian Colleges Inc. announced it will close its last 28 campuses, marking progress in the fight against predatory for-profit colleges. Once enrolling over 70,000 students, Corinthian heavily relied on federal aid—86% of its revenue—and left many graduates burdened with debt and poor job prospects. Though for-profit schools enroll just 13% of U.S. college students, they account for nearly half of all loan defaults, with default rates exceeding those of subprime borrowers. These institutions lure low-income students with aggressive recruiting, online courses, and federal loans, but yield outcomes worse than a high school dropout. High-profile investigations and state actions have exposed widespread rule-breaking—fake diplomas, inflated job-placement claims, encouraged cheating—and prompted hundreds of Corinthian alumni to launch a “debt strike.” Education Secretary Arne Duncan has signaled willingness to forgive their loans. The author argues that all remaining for-profit colleges should be closed, and debts forgiven for any students who aren’t employed or transferred to reputable schools within three years, to protect students and safeguard the value of a college degree."

English-speaking Afghans once employed by NATO have been fired, blacklisted and now live in market stalls, fearing reprisals and unable to support their families. Neighborhoods that housed foreigners—“poppy palaces,” Chicken Street shops and contractors’ restaurants—stand deserted. Outside the city, idle excavators and supply trucks that once sustained 120,000 troops rust away; their drivers are stranded with vehicles they can’t sell after contractors fled with the profits. Meanwhile, lavishly lit wedding palaces multiply, signaling enduring optimism—or perhaps imminent departure. Massive diesel generators installed by NATO lie largely unused, prompting questions about how long Kabul’s lights will stay on as the last Americans prepare to retreat into the U.S. Embassy."
11885,"Consumer Reports reviewed 70 million U.S. domestic trips over two years to compare award-seat availability among the five largest U.S. carriers.  Key findings:  
• Southwest led all carriers with 11.9 million award seats—11.5% of its 103.1 million seats—thanks to “Every Seat Is an Award Seat,” no blackout dates, nonexpiring points, a network of over 90 destinations, and no fees for close-in bookings or cancellations.  
• JetBlue ranked last with 892,000 award seats (4.5% of 19.7 million seats); its limited market presence and typically infrequent flyer base make mile accumulation harder, though points now never expire.  
• Delta was second (5.6 million award seats), United third (5 million), and American fourth (3.5 million).  
• Nearly 10% of passengers flew on award tickets, but low-fare routes (e.g., L.A.–San Francisco) often offer poor mileage value compared with pricier routes (e.g., New York–San Francisco or Chicago–Los Angeles).  
• Customer satisfaction scores were highest at Southwest (86) and JetBlue (85), then Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). Southwest also stands out for charging no baggage, booking or change fees.  
• Remember that award tickets aren’t free—mile costs are embedded in spending, and unused miles are profitable for airlines—so travelers should choose redemption options carefully."
11890,"James Holmes drew global attention in June 2012 when, dressed in body armor, a gas mask and carrying an AR-15 and other weapons, he opened fire during a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 and wounding 70. Authorities noted his Joker-like appearance, but he’s facing 165 charges—including murder and attempted murder—while pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty; opening statements begin Monday. Holmes’s lawyers argue he suffered a “severe mental illness” and was in a psychotic episode. Jury selection drew 9,000 summonses; the final panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates is mostly white and middle-aged, and the trial could run into autumn.  
Holmes, 27, was once a top neuroscience student—earning a UC Riverside degree with highest honors in 2010 and entering a NIH-funded Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado Anschutz. In early 2012 he made threats to kill, was cut off from campus after dropping enrollment, and saw a university psychiatrist who warned he might be dangerous. In the weeks before the shooting, he bought four guns, 6,000 rounds of ammo and booby-trapped his apartment. Shortly before the attack he called the university switchboard and exchanged texts about “dysphoric mania.”  
Victims’ groups are urging media to stop naming mass killers. Holmes’s parents have pleaded for his life to be spared and, if found insane, that he be confined to a mental institution. A jury will decide his fate."
11891,"Prosperity-gospel pastor Creflo Dollar has defended his drive to raise $300 each from 200,000 global supporters to buy a $65 million Gulfstream G650, blaming “the devil” for critics who question his motive, tithing practices and even his real name. In a recent five-minute YouTube address to his World Changers Church congregation, he denied ever asking parishioners directly for jet money—even though in March he posted a video appealing to “friends around the world” to replace his 1984 Gulfstream G-1159A after two safety incidents, including a runway skid in London with his wife and daughters aboard. Though the original fundraising page has been taken down, donations still flow through the church’s gift page. Dollar insists that, with over three million supporters worldwide, private air travel is essential to his ministry’s work. The G650 seats 18 plus four crew, boasts two Rolls-Royce engines, high-speed Internet and dual satellites, and can fly nonstop from New York to Los Angeles in about 4½ hours. Attempts to reach Dollar’s ministry for further comment were unsuccessful; CNN’s Steve Almasy contributed to this report."
