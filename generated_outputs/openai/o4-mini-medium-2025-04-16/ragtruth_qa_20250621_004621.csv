4. Draw and title your graph  
   • Give it a clear title.  
   • Draw a vertical (y-) axis and a horizontal (x-) axis.

5. Scale and label your axes  
   • Decide how “high” the y-axis must go to cover your largest value.  
   • Label the y-axis with evenly spaced intervals and the x-axis with your categories (months, states, etc.).

6. Plot your data with bars  
   • For each category on the x-axis, draw a rectangular bar whose height matches its value on the y-axis.  
   • Keep bar widths equal and spacing consistent.

7. Add finishing touches  
   • Color or shade each bar for clarity.  
   • Double-check that bar heights are proportionate to your data.

15404,"Bird air sacs serve chiefly to ventilate the lungs and boost oxygen delivery.  Because birds lack a diaphragm, the sacs act as bellows—chest movements create pressure changes that draw air in and push it out.  Their system of seven to nine sacs also forces air through the lungs in a unidirectional flow, so every breath carries freshly oxygen‐rich air across the lung tissue.  This arrangement supplements birds’ relatively small lungs to meet a high metabolic demand.  The sacs even extend into hollow bones (humerus, femur, vertebrae, skull) and, on expiration, channel air through the syrinx and trachea to the outside."

12354,"Wait until spring when the soil has warmed to about 60°F and all danger of frost has passed (often a bit after you set out tomato plants). Select a full-sun site with sandy, well-drained, slightly acidic soil (pH 6.2–6.5); if your soil is heavy or clay, mix in sand and peat moss. Plant your dahlia tubers (“bulbs”) in the prepared soil. Water established plants deeply about once a week. To encourage extra-large blooms, pinch off all side buds as they appear. If you’re lifting tubers for winter, pot them in a cool, dry garage (above freezing), cover the pots with a tarp or blanket for protection, and keep the soil from getting too wet."

6. If you pray, always end with “RAmen.”

1. Make butter from milk  
  a. Boil milk and chill it in the refrigerator.  
  b. Over a week or two, skim off the cream that rises and collect it in a bowl.
