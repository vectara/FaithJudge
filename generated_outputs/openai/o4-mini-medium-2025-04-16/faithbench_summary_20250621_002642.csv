14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades stormed Kabul’s 400-bed Sardar Daud hospital at 09:00 local time after detonating explosives at the gate and opening fire on staff and patients. Over six hours of fighting ended when commandos, who had landed on the roof, killed all four attackers. More than 50 people were wounded. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, while the Taliban denied involvement. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the assault as an attack on all Afghanistan, and deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah vowed to avenge the victims. Witnesses described gunmen—even one in a white coat—firing on doctors, guards and patients and people hiding on window ledges.  
This marked IS’s first direct clash with security forces in Kabul, using a Taliban-style breach tactic that suggests growing resources and training. Since declaring its Khorasan Province in 2015, IS has carried out high-profile attacks in Kabul—a July 2016 rally bombing (about 80 killed), twin Ashura explosions (around 30 dead), a mosque attack that November (over 30 fatalities) and last month’s Supreme Court assault (22 killed). Afghan authorities say they have cleared IS from some eastern bases but not from mountainous areas. Meanwhile, the Taliban has also stepped up attacks, including suicide bombings in Kabul that killed 16 people a week earlier."
14-1,"The 2014 Booker Prize shortlist, announced for a Tuesday ceremony at London’s Guildhall, includes six novels by three British writers, two Americans and one Australian—making it the first year the award is open to any English-language author regardless of nationality. Sudipto (“Mukherjee”)’s The Lives of Others is the 5/2 favorite, followed by Richard Flanagan’s The Narrow Road to the Deep North at 3/1. Former winner Howard Jacobson is nominated for his futuristic love story J. The other contenders are Ali Smith’s How to Be Both, Joshua Ferris’s To Rise Again at a Decent Hour and Karen Joy Fowler’s We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. Fowler’s book leads in sales (55,000 copies), while Ferris has sold just over 6,000. Shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition. The 46th‐annual prize is judged by a panel chaired by AC Grayling and will be presented by the Duchess of Cornwall, with BBC coverage from 21:30 BST.  "
14-2,"After Brexit, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised observers by choosing a third option—extending his term by just one year, until mid-2019—rather than leaving in 2018 as originally planned or staying through 2021. While markets and politicians expected a longer extension to provide continuity during the EU-exit negotiations, Carney’s decision was driven chiefly by family considerations: two of his daughters will be taking major exams in 2018, and he and his wife wish to return to Canada’s education system thereafter. He emphasized the move was “entirely personal,” enjoyed Theresa May’s support, and said his brief extension will cover the Article 50 process before a new governor takes over."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, a celebrated Sunday Times columnist since 1993, has died after being diagnosed last month with what he called the “full English” of cancers. Despite undergoing chemotherapy, he remained stoical, calling himself “very lucky.” His final column on coming to terms with his illness appears in tomorrow’s paper. Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens remembered Gill as the paper’s “heart and soul,” praising his wit, fearless prose and compassion.

Peers and rivals alike—among them Jay Rayner, Tim Shipman, Stig Abell, John Witherow, Andrew Neil and Piers Morgan—paid tribute to his brilliance and unique voice. Gill was also known for sparking controversy, from recounting shooting a baboon to searing remarks about the Welsh, Rhyl, Norfolk, the Isle of Man and Clare Balding, and once being ejected from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.

Born in Edinburgh in 1954 and overcoming dyslexia, Gill studied art in London before writing for magazines, Tatler and then the Sunday Times. He married author Cressida Connolly in 1983, Home Secretary Amber Rudd in 1991 (two children), and was engaged to Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins."
14-4,"Independent hacker collectives have become key players in the Ukraine–Russia conflict. The best-known are the pro-Ukrainian Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the anti-Western Cyber Berkut, and Russia-focused group Anonymous International (aka b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay).  

Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Yevhen Dokukin, use distributed denial-of-service attacks to cripple rebel websites, hijack CCTV cameras, billboards and network printers to broadcast pro-Ukrainian messages, and target separatist funding via PayPal and WebMoney accounts. Dokukin says he hacked Russian interior-ministry servers and Rostov-region police emails, passing 35 GB of data to Inform Napalm, which uncovered evidence that wounded Russian servicemen were evacuated from Ukraine.  

Cyber Berkut, named after the riot police of ousted president Yanukovych, aims to disrupt Ukraine’s military efforts and paints Kiev as committing “genocide.” It has defaced government websites during Joe Biden’s visit, hijacked Kiev billboards with anti-Ukrainian propaganda, claimed to tamper with election vote-counting systems, leaked defence-ministry data and alleged Ukrainian responsibility for the MH17 shoot-down.  

Anonymous International specializes in Kremlin leaks. Though its hacking methods are unclear, it has published internal Kremlin correspondence, letters from Russian fighters in Ukraine and emails of former rebel commander Igor Girkin. Its website is now blocked in Russia."

15-3,"• A University of Washington study published in the American Journal of Public Health finds heavy drinking among Americans rose 17.2% from 2005 to 2012, driven mainly by women’s increased consumption.  
• “Heavy drinking” is defined as over one drink per day for women and over two for men; “binge drinking” as four-plus drinks for women or five-plus for men on one occasion in the past month.  
• Between 2002 and 2012 in Santa Clara County, women’s binge‐drinking rates climbed nearly 36% versus 23% for men; nationwide, women’s binge‐drinking rate increased more than seven times that of men.  
• In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% binge drinkers, while overall alcohol use remained steady. County extremes: Madison (ID) had the lowest binge rate (6%), Menominee (WI) the highest (36%); Hancock (TN) the fewest heavy drinkers (2%), Esmeralda (NV) the most (22%).  
• Alcohol contributed to an estimated 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010 and cost over $220 billion annually. Treatment centers report growing demand, though many seek help only after serious consequences.  
• Experts attribute the rise to shifting social norms for women, higher disposable income among young professionals, relatively cheaper alcohol (taxes lagging inflation), increased liquor advertising, and weaker alcohol‐control policies.  
• The analysis covered about 3.7 million U.S. adults (age 21+) using CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data."

In the second period Mike Forney converted a power-play breakaway to put one side up 2–1, only for Andy Bohmback to level the score again. Mike Radja and James Desmarais then pushed the tally to 4–2 before Nottingham’s David Ling grabbed a late goal. The same teams meet again Saturday in the second game of their double-header.

2. Francis I (François Ier; 12 Sept 1494 – 31 Mar 1547) was the first king of France from the Angoulême branch of the Valois dynasty, ruling from 1515 until his death. Nicknamed “François au Grand Nez,” “Grand Colas” and “Roi-Chevalier,” he personally led wars against his rival Charles V. After failing to prevail, he controversially allied with Suleiman the Magnificent, and he fought the Italian War of 1536–1538 against Charles V."

Castleford then scored three times in four minutes—Larne Patrick (fresh from signing a three-year deal from Huddersfield), Luke Gale and Flynn (his hat-trick)—but could not level the game. Mellor’s opportunist try off a short kick-off had earlier extended Widnes’ advantage to 26 points.

Capped twice by Scotland in 2008 (one goal), he has nearly 400 senior club appearances, with past spells at Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers.

16-0,"The passage opens by projecting Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao as the richest, most significant fight of the century, noting its ultimate place in boxing history will hinge on what transpires that night in Las Vegas. It then turns to the sixth bout in a proposed “12 fights that shaped boxing history,” focusing on the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Durán trilogy during boxing’s golden era.

1. Their first meeting ended in Durán’s unanimous decision win—a verdict mired in scoring errors and dubbed “a monument to indecision.”
2. Eight months later, in New Orleans, Leonard abandoned a head-to-head slugfest for hit-and-run tactics. His speed and feints so demoralized Durán that, after an eighth-round jab, the Panamanian turned his back and quit, famously uttering “no mas.” The stunned world saw Durán’s reputation collapse almost overnight.
3. Durán blamed stomach cramps, but insiders insisted he quit from embarrassment. He spent three years rebuilding his image, culminating in a 1983 knockout of Davey Moore to reclaim a world title.
4. Their 1989 rubber match ended with Leonard winning on points. Leonard later declared forcing Durán to quit more satisfying than knocking him out."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy, the world number one, is determined to win The Masters and complete golf’s career Grand Slam, calling it “unthinkable” that he won’t eventually wear the green jacket. He cites his dramatic final-round collapse at Augusta in 2011—when a four-shot lead turned into an 80 and a 10-shot defeat—as the most important day of his career because of the lessons it taught him. In six Masters starts he’s recorded only one top-10 (T8 in 2015), but he has since won four other majors (the 2011 US Open, 2012 PGA Championship and both the Open and US PGA in 2014). McIlroy, who endured personal distractions last year—calling off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki and a costly legal dispute—hopes the Augusta course will again be his “sanctuary” amid all the pre-tournament hype and that this year he can not only claim his first green jacket but perhaps return for more."
16-2,"Spanish cyclist Pablo Mandado (27) and Latvian Ilze Zebolde (31) quit their Manchester restaurant jobs in 2017 to embark on an open-ended, ultra-low-budget bike tour of the world. In their first 356 days they’ve pedaled nearly 7,000 miles (11,132 km) across 16 countries—from London through France’s west and south coasts, Spain, Portugal, northern Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia and Greece, into Turkey’s northern coast, then Georgia and Armenia. With no fixed route or schedule, they’ve made over 222 stops, often camping under the stars (161 nights) or staying free via Couchsurfing (66) and Warmshowers (44). Relying on pedal power alone, they live on just €2.99 each per day (about €0.10/km), spending €2.74 on simple staples—pasta, bread, rice, eggs, milk, seasonal produce—and supplementing with wild foraging, invitations and occasional dumpster finds. Showers come “sometimes daily, sometimes weekly.” After crossing into Asia at the Greece–Turkey bridge, they plan to push onward through Asia, cross the Pacific and cycle the length of the Americas over the coming years."
16-3,"Pablo Mandado (27, from Spain) and Ilze Zebolde (31, from Latvia) gave up their restaurant jobs in Manchester to spend an open-ended year (so far 356 days) cycling the world “a pedal at a time.” Starting from London, they’ve ridden nearly 7,000 miles (11,132 km) through 16 countries—down France’s west and south coasts, through Spain and Portugal, then across Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, Georgia and into Armenia. They carry about 130 kg of gear, make roughly 225 stops, and travel at a rate of ten euro cents per kilometre. Their daily budget is just €2.99 each, of which €2.74 goes on food staples (pasta, bread, rice, eggs, milk, seasonal produce), supplemented by invitations, foraged fruits or even dumpster finds. Accommodation is almost entirely free: camping under the stars (161 nights), Couchsurfing (66) or Warmshowers hosts (44), plus occasional stranger hospitality.

16-4,"A three-bedroom, 1,990 sq ft maisonette on Egerton Place in Knightsbridge has been listed for £575,000 despite the area’s typical three-bed asking price of around £1.5 million. The flat comes almost “bargain”-priced because it has only three years remaining on its lease; at £191,000 per year (or about £15,000 per month), the upfront cost mirrors local rental rates. Unmodernised, it includes two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift access, parking and a communal garden. A neighbouring larger maisonette with the same short lease is on the market for £595,000.  

Estate agents say that, once modernised and if the lease is extended to a typical 90-year term (at an estimated extension cost of £3.35–4.5 million payable to the freeholder, thought to be the Wellcome Trust), the smaller property could command around £6 million (and the larger about £7.5 million). Short-lease homes in Knightsbridge are rare; the next cheapest three-bed with a 28-year lease is priced at £1.5 million. Surveyors warn buyers of the “massive premium” required to extend the lease, suggesting developers might snap up such bargains or rent them out for three years before returning the flat to the freeholder. Egerton Place was built in 1893 to architect Mervyn Macartney’s designs, its original 1894 leases granted by the Smith’s Charity Trustees."

This will be McCoy’s final ride in a Grade One race—a decision he announced after Mr Mole’s Newbury win in February—and his full programme for his last day as a professional jockey will be confirmed Friday. Other contenders include Mick Channon’s Somersby."
11-1,"At 75, Jack Nicklaus thrilled the Augusta National gallery by acing the 130-yard fourth hole during the Masters’ par-3 contest—his first hole-in-one at Augusta—while playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw. Although Nicklaus quipped before the round that all he needed was “a hole in one,” his feat was one of five aces that day (tying the 2002 record). Colombia’s Camilo Villegas followed with two aces but lost the par-3 title to Kevin Streelman in a playoff. Nicklaus, the youngest green-jacket wearer in 1963 and six-time champion by 1986, remains one of only five players to complete golf’s career grand slam."
11-3,"Scientists have found the carcass of an Omura’s whale—a species once feared extinct—washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Cyclone Olwyn. This 5.68 m juvenile female is the first recorded in WA and the second in Australia; it was positively identified only after DNA profiling. Described in scientific literature in 2003 and thought to inhabit tropical–subtropical Indo-Pacific waters (Indonesia, the Philippines, Sea of Japan), very little is known about the species. Authorities say the discovery is “highly significant” for improving field identification and mapping its distribution. After burial of the carcass, the skeleton—marked by a sleek body, an unusually high vertebrae count and four digits on each pectoral fin—will be exhumed in a few years for detailed study and possible museum display."
11-4,"An Omura’s whale—first described in 2003 and long thought rare—washed up dead on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Cyclone Olwyn. The 5.68 m juvenile female is the state’s first sighting (Australia’s second) and was confirmed by DNA profiling after initial identification difficulties. Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the find “highly significant,” since little is known about this tropical/subtropical species, typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. The carcass has been buried; its skeleton—featuring a sleek body, over 50 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin—will be recovered in a few years for further study and possible museum display, helping improve field identification and distribution knowledge."

10-0,"Russian officials publicly opened the Su-24’s “black box” in Moscow, though key flight data appear to be missing; a fuller analysis of the recorder—expected next week—might settle Russia and Turkey’s dispute over whether the jet was downed in Syrian or Turkish airspace. The incident, on 24 November, saw the jet hit by Turkish F-16s: both crew ejected, but the pilot was killed—apparently by militants on the ground—and the navigator rescued; a Russian marine sent to help also died and a rescue helicopter was destroyed.  

Tensions have since spiraled: Turkey maintains it warned the aircraft to leave its airspace, while Russia insists it was acting over Syria; President Putin has lashed out at Ankara’s “subservience” to the U.S. and alleged “creeping Islamisation.” Moscow has demanded a Turkish apology and slapped on sanctions—most notably banning package holidays—which could cost Turkey billions of dollars."
10-2,"An oil storage tank at a paraxylene (PX) plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, exploded late Monday after an oil leak, injuring six people (five hospitalized with glass cuts) and triggering a large fire. PX—a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in polyester production—was not reported to have leaked. More than 600 firefighters brought the blaze under control by Tuesday morning. Nearby residents posted on social media that they heard a loud blast and felt tremors. The Zhangzhou facility, relocated there in 2007 from Xiamen amid pollution concerns, also suffered a noninjurious blast in 2013. Construction of PX plants in China has repeatedly sparked protests, sometimes turning violent."
10-3,"A 15-year-old girl met a man identified as David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage in autumn 2004. Now 34 and living as Davina Ayrton, the defendant denies raping the teenager while her two friends slept. At Portsmouth Crown Court, Judge Ian Pearson remanded Ayrton into custody—likely at Winchester’s male prison—citing risks of self-harm and non-attendance, and set sentencing for 4 March. The court learned Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, will be subject to special detention protocols. During the trial, she spoke of her sexuality—saying she has made no physical changes or taken medication—and noted she legally changed her name in 2012. The victim, having had only one and a half cans of beer, clearly recalled shouting at Ayrton to stop. In 2014 Ayrton told a care-home worker in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, about the attack."
10-4,"Eugene, USA, has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships after the IAAF council chose to bypass the normal bidding process, calling it a “unique strategic opportunity” to hold the event in the United States for the first time. Eugene had previously failed in its bid for the 2019 championships, which went to Doha. IAAF President Lamine Diack praised the partnership of public authorities, the private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC and local fans, and said the move serves the sport’s global development. A similar no-bid decision was made for the 2007 Osaka championships. Separately, Mo Farah won the men’s 10,000 m gold at the 2016 Moscow World Championships."
13-0,"Doncaster-based Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson, seriously injured by a bomb in Afghanistan in 2006, carried the Olympic torch on 26 June—walking for nearly half an hour with an assistant amid hundreds of supporters. Since then he’s received over 5,000 Facebook friend requests (hitting the site’s personal‐page limit), plus thousands of hits and messages on the Pilgrim Bandits website. Although a brain injury initially robbed him of speech, he now talks unaided, spends 12 hours a day on gym work and rehab, uses crutches, and devotes his spare time to fundraising as patron of Pilgrim Bandits. His mother, Diane, says the outpouring of emails, letters and torch‐relay invitations has been “phenomenal” and hugely uplifting for Ben. Facebook recommends that public figures with such interest switch to a public page or use the “subscribe” feature. The relay itself will cover 8,000 miles over 70 days, carried by 8,000 people, en route to the London opening ceremony on 27 July."
13-1,"Demelza Poldark, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, gives birth to her and Ross’s newborn daughter within minutes of tomorrow’s episode, prompting Ross (Aidan Turner) to gaze lovingly at her. Fans have praised Ross as a Sunday-night heartthrob but noted that his affections are firmly with Demelza. Critics and viewers alike have questioned the show’s rapid pregnancy timeline: after last week’s announcement, Demelza is suddenly eight months along and then in labor almost immediately, mirroring a similar jump in Elizabeth’s storyline. On Twitter, one fan quipped, “If you are pregnant in Poldark times expect to have it in the next 10 minutes.”"
13-2,"Last year, 272 children in England were hospitalized with disabilities caused by foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), though experts say many more cases go undiagnosed. World Health Organization research cited by the Sunday People estimates at least one in 100 UK babies—around 7,500 a year—suffer learning, behavioural or physical defects (such as deformed limbs) from prenatal alcohol exposure. Elizabeth Mitchell of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome warns that affected children never outgrow their disabilities. Fifteen-year-old Niamh Brown, unable to dress herself or judge danger, was diagnosed with FAS at age five; her adoptive parents later founded the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust. Other risks include liver, kidney and heart damage, cerebral palsy, sight loss and epilepsy. Current UK guidance allows up to two units of alcohol twice a week during pregnancy, but Mitchell argues for a total abstinence recommendation."
13-3,"Scotland’s women’s team have won all five Euro qualifiers so far and host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium, where a win would virtually guarantee their place at next summer’s finals in the Netherlands. Forward Jane Ross Evans—who has twice seen Scotland lose in play‐off deciders—says missing out again would be “devastating,” and she and veteran goalkeeper Gemma Fay have long aimed for a first major finals appearance. Iceland, ranked 20th in the world, are also unbeaten in four games, and the two fixtures between the sides will likely decide the group winner. With six of the eight best runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are well-placed to avoid another play-off.

Twelve of Scotland’s 20-player squad now play abroad—in England, Sweden and the US—including BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year Kim Little. Perth-born Evans celebrated winning the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich in her first season there, joining Franck Ribéry and Arjen Robben in the team’s city-hall parade. She believes the high-level competition and different styles she encounters overseas are lifting the entire national team as they chase a first major‐tournament berth."
13-4,"A light Aerostar general-aviation plane landed gear-up on the Aero Acres residential airpark runway in Fort Pierce, Florida. Video shows it touching down on its belly at speed, propellers and wingtips sparking along the tarmac, then the pilot re-engaging full throttle and lifting off again despite damaged propellers. The witness narrates that the pilot only realized the missing landing gear at touchdown, and marveled that the engines survived the impacts and that the aircraft didn’t stall during the high-angle forced takeoff. The pilot, 85-year-old Chris Georgaklis—who was flying with his dog Buddy—then flew about 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale, where he landed safely. The FAA is investigating; gear-up landings typically result from pilot oversight or mechanical failure."

12-0,"A juvenile female Omura’s whale (5.68 m) was found washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Cyclone Olwyn—the first record of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff initially struggled to identify it but confirmed the species by DNA profiling. Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the discovery “highly significant,” since Omura’s whales were only described in 2003 and little is known about their tropical and subtropical distribution. They are usually seen in Indonesian waters, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. The species has a sleek body and unique skeletal traits—reported in the passage as having either 53 or 60 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried, and the skeleton will be exhumed in a few years for further study and possible museum display."
12-1,"Conor McGregor, the 26-year-old Irish contender, is set to challenge featherweight champion José Aldo on July 11 in Las Vegas. Ahead of the bout, McGregor—already sporting a gorilla-eating-a-heart chest tattoo—unveiled a new tiger-face ink on his stomach, captioning it “If you see the tiger, it’s too late. You’re food.” He has publicly asserted that Aldo “doesn’t want this” as much as he does. In late March, during a Dublin promotional stop, McGregor famously grabbed Aldo’s belt and held it aloft before some 5,000 supporters, highlighting their tense rivalry just weeks before Aldo’s eighth title defense."
12-3,"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 35 km north of Lucca at a depth of 15.5 km at 15:48 local time, with its epicentre in Garfagnana, the INGV reported. Several lower-magnitude aftershocks followed and the tremor was felt as far away as Milan, Florence, Bologna and Modena. Phone lines and power were down in Garfagnana, and nearby schools were evacuated and inspected, but no injuries or damage were immediately reported. Alessandro Amato of the INGV described the event as a “medium-strong, fairly shallow” quake typical for the area. Italy remains vulnerable to earthquakes—almost 300 people died in the 2009 L’Aquila quake, and over 20 were killed by two quakes in Garfagnana last May. Six experts were later convicted of manslaughter for downplaying the risk before the 2009 L’Aquila disaster, advice that led many residents to stay indoors and perish."
12-4,"Bobbi Kristina Brown, 22, the daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, has “global and irreversible brain damage,” her grandmother Cissy Houston said after visiting her. Although she’s no longer in a medically induced coma, Brown remains unresponsive—she doesn’t react to voices or visitors, her eyes don’t track, and she has a tracheostomy—and is expected to live in this state indefinitely. Two days earlier, Bobby Brown told an audience she was “awake” and watching him, and family attorney Christopher Brown confirmed her condition has technically improved: doctors expect her to survive long term, but her ultimate quality of life won’t be known for years. Bobby’s wife, Alicia Etheredge-Brown, added that Kristina has left the ICU, opened her eyes, and begun a lengthy rehabilitation."
