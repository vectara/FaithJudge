Positive reviews praise the bold, well-sized coffee and espresso, thin and tasty pancakes, properly cooked eggs, friendly and accommodating staff (even at closing time), and a well-appointed dining area. Some guests flagged lapses in service at the bar—difficulty adjusting TV volume, slow delivery of side orders and inconsistent attention from staff—and mixed feedback on dinner dishes (overcooked shrimp, bland chowder, rollout of garlic bread). Despite these criticisms, many visitors recommend Crocodile Restaurant & Bar for its breakfast offerings, courteous service and comfortable setting."
14991,"Pierre Lafond Wine Bistro is located at 516 State Street in Santa Barbara, CA. Open daily from 11:00 to 21:00, it combines bakery, deli, wine bar and restaurant offerings—ranging from American‐New and Italian dishes to local‐flavor small plates—with a full bar and nightlife atmosphere.

Key points from customer reviews:

15018,"Ca’ Dario is an Italian-style Tuscan and seafood restaurant and wine bar located at 37 E Victoria St in Santa Barbara, CA. Open nightly from 4:00 PM (4:30 PM on Fridays) until 8:30–9:30 PM, it offers outdoor seating, group-friendly space and accepts reservations. Valet and lot parking aren’t available, but there is street and garage parking. The venue is classified as “classy,” does not offer Wi-Fi, and provides takeout service.

With an average rating of 4.0 stars, customer opinions are mixed. Positive feedback highlights attentive service in a cozy, small dining room, well-balanced cocktails (like the Aperol spritz), a fresh Caprese salad and standout ravioli with sage and brown butter. Wine selections draw praise, though some find them pricey.

On the other hand, several diners describe portions of pasta and chicken dishes as underseasoned or overcooked, salads as mostly lettuce with heavy cheese, and bread as merely “average.” A party of ten reported a billing mix-up, and repeated requests for improved vegetarian or vegan options went unanswered. Despite these criticisms, the pork chop and certain seafood plates earn occasional acclaim."
15019,"El Rincon Bohemio-Goleta is a casual Mexican restaurant at 298 Pine Ave, Goleta, CA, open Monday through Friday from 11:00–21:00 and Saturday–Sunday from 09:00–21:00. It holds a 3.5-star average rating and offers free WiFi, outdoor patio seating, takeout, group dining, and accepts reservations. Parking is available in an on-site lot.

Customer feedback is mixed. One 2-star review describes the food as “average Mexican,” comparing it to 1980s chain fare and noting a perceived drop in quality. In contrast, two 5-star reviews praise the restaurant as “the best Mexican food” near UCSB, highlighting fun, polite waitstaff and hostess, specific dishes such as the steak Bohemio and a memorable michelada, and the enjoyable patio atmosphere with live mariachi performances."
15020,"The Lark is a New American cocktail bar and restaurant located at 131 Anacapa St, Ste A in Santa Barbara’s Funk Zone. Open Tuesday through Sunday from 5 PM (closing at 9 PM on weekdays and Sunday, 10 PM on Friday and Saturday), it offers free Wi-Fi, outdoor seating with heat lamps and a fireplace, street parking only, and accepts reservations. The setting is described as both trendy and classy, and it can accommodate groups, though it does not offer take-out or valet service.

With an overall Yelp rating of 4.0 stars, The Lark specializes in a shared-dining menu featuring items such as crispy Brussels sprouts, winter beets with marinated burrata, caramelized cauliflower, Morro Bay black cod, Creekstone Prime hanger steak and buttermilk-fried chicken. Guests praise its wine-by-the-glass selections and craft cocktails (notably the Black Manhattan and gimlet). Reviewers highlight attentive staff—including servers Laurel and Oscar and host Alberto—who facilitate timely service, personalized recommendations and occasional complimentary pours. While most diners commend the food quality and ambiance, a few note inconsistent service levels during quieter periods. Reservations are strongly recommended."
15025,"Cafe del Sol is a casual American (Traditional and New) and Mexican restaurant located at 30 Los Patos Way in Santa Barbara, CA. It holds a 3.5-star average and offers outdoor seating, street and lot parking, reservations, take-out service and group accommodations; WiFi is not available. Reviewers consistently praise the friendly staff (and owner Alfredo), the relaxed happy-hour atmosphere and drink selection—especially margaritas—and note free appetizers on select days. Menu highlights include a well-received chicken enchilada, generous tostada and fresh salsa, but several guests describe food portions as small for the price and question the value of items like a $16 tostada. One August 2014 review also mentions a temporary liquor license suspension that limited bar service."
