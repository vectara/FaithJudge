14-0,"Militants stormed Kabul’s 400-bed Sardar Daud military hospital at 09:00 local time, blowing open the gate, then shooting staff and patients with guns and grenades. Afghan special-forces commandos landed on the roof and, after more than six hours of fighting, killed all four attackers. The so-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility; the Taliban denied involvement. The defence ministry reported more than 50 wounded (fatalities were not specified). President Ashraf Ghani and de-facto deputy Abdullah Abdullah condemned the assault, calling it an attack on all Afghans and vowing retribution. Analysts note this is IS’s first direct clash with security forces in Kabul, using Taliban-style tactics that suggest increased resources and training, raising fears of further such operations. IS has mounted several high-profile Kabul attacks since 2015, while the Taliban also continues its own offensive."
14-1,"The 46th Man Booker Prize, now open to all English-language authors, will be decided Tuesday at London’s Guildhall. Six novels are shortlisted:

• Neel Mukherjee – The Lives of Others (5/2 favourite with William Hill; Calcutta family drama, 1967)  
• Howard Jacobson – J (futuristic love story; Jacobson won in 2010)  
• Ali Smith – How to Be Both (dual narrative, Renaissance Italy / 1960s child)  
• Joshua Ferris – To Rise Again at a Decent Hour (atheist New York dentist; ~6,000 sales)  
• Karen Joy Fowler – We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves (family tale; best-seller with 55,000 copies)  
• Richard Flanagan – The Narrow Road to the Deep North (WWII Thailand-Burma railway; 3/1 second favourite)

Fowler’s novel leads sales; Mukherjee’s showed the biggest post-shortlist surge. Critics call the list “weak,” though some rate Jacobson’s J the strongest book. Judges are chaired by A. C. Grayling with Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Each shortlisted author gets £2,500 and a special edition; the winner will be announced on BBC News Channel and BBC Arts."
14-2,"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, expected either to leave in 2018 or stay until 2021, chose a “third way”: he will extend his term by just one year, finishing in 2019.  
He says the decision is entirely personal, driven mainly by family considerations—two of his four daughters reach key exam stages in 2018 and the family wishes to return to Canada then. Carney felt it would be hard to depart in the midst of Brexit talks, so the extra year should see the Article 50 process largely completed. Those around him deny any tension with Prime Minister Theresa May or that criticism of the Bank’s pre-referendum forecasts influenced him; the government left the timing up to him."
14-3,"AA Gill, the acclaimed but often controversial Sunday Times columnist and critic, has died shortly after revealing he had multiple cancers he called the “full English.” Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens hailed him as “a giant among journalists,” noting his final piece on facing the disease will appear tomorrow. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill overcame severe dyslexia, studied art, and began writing in the 1980s before joining the Sunday Times in 1993, where his dazzling, fearless prose and telephone-dictated copy made him a distinctive voice. Tributes from figures such as Jay Rayner, Tim Shipman, and former editors John Witherow and Andrew Neil praised his brilliance. Gill’s sharp writing also drew frequent controversy, including remarks about the Welsh, the Isle of Man, and shooting a baboon. He was previously married to author Cressida Connolly and to future Home Secretary Amber Rudd (with whom he had two children), and was recently engaged to long-time partner Nicola Formby, mother of their twins."
14-4,"The passage profiles three self-declared activist hacking groups active around the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

1. Ukrainian Cyber Troops
   • Led by Kyiv programmer Yevhen Dokukin.  
   • Tactics: hacks Russian servers and email accounts, hands data to Ukraine’s security service; conducts DDoS attacks on separatist sites; blocks rebel PayPal/WebMoney accounts; taps public CCTV in rebel areas; hijacks network printers for pro-Ukrainian messages.  
   • Inform Napalm analysed 35 GB of their leaks, allegedly showing wounded Russian soldiers in Ukraine.  
   • Officials deny using their intelligence for artillery targeting.

2. Cyber Berkut
   • Pro-Russian, anti-Western group named after Ukraine’s former riot police.  
   • Aims to hinder Kyiv’s military actions and claims to fight “genocide” by the West.  
   • Actions: defaced Ukrainian government sites during U.S. Vice-President Biden’s visit; says it stole documents on U.S. military aid; hijacked Kyiv billboards with anti-government videos; claims to have disrupted election vote-counting, leaked defence data, blocked President Poroshenko’s site, and posted an unverified chat blaming Ukraine for MH17.

3. Anonymous International (aka b0ltai/Shaltay Boltay)
   • Russian activist outfit known for leaking Kremlin documents.  
   • Source of materials (hacking vs. insider leaks) unclear.  
   • Publishes mainly on Russian domestic issues but has posted Ukraine-related items, including a fighter’s letter doubting local support for separatists and alleged emails of ex-FSB colonel Igor Girkin.  
   • Its website is currently blocked in Russia.

Overall, these groups publicize hacked data, deface or disable online resources, and wage information warfare on opposing sides of the Ukraine conflict while professing independence from state sponsors."

15-3,"A nationwide study from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (University of Washington), published in the American Journal of Public Health, shows U.S. heavy drinking rose 17.2% from 2005-2012, driven mainly by women. Heavy drinking (average >1 drink/day for women, >2 for men) affected 8% of adults in 2012; binge drinking (≥4 drinks for women, ≥5 for men on one occasion) affected 18%. Women’s binge-drinking rates grew more than seven times those of men; in Santa Clara County, CA, women’s rates jumped 36% vs. 23% for men. County extremes in 2012: lowest binge drinking—Madison County, ID (6%); highest—Menominee, WI (36%); fewest heavy drinkers—Hancock County, TN (2%); most—Esmeralda County, NV (22%). Overall alcohol use stayed steady, yet excessive drinking is linked to about 88,600 U.S. deaths (2010) and costs over $220 billion yearly. Researchers cite changing social norms for women, youthful and affluent populations, cheaper alcohol, increased advertising, and looser control laws as contributing factors."

Nicknamed “Francis of the Large Nose,” “the Grand Colas,” and “the Knight-King,” he personally led campaigns against his rival Charles V.

16-0,"The article contrasts the impending Mayweather–Pacquiao bout—predicted to be the richest and potentially most significant fight of this century—with a historic rivalry highlighted in a 12-part series on bouts that shaped boxing.  
Fight 6 in the series is Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Durán:

• Context: Their first two clashes helped launch boxing’s “golden age” at the lower-middle weights, involving Leonard, Durán, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler. Leonard had previously taken the world welterweight title from Félix Trinidad.

• First fight (Montreal, 1980): Durán narrowly out-pointed Leonard amid confused scoring that was first announced as a majority decision, then changed to a unanimous 148-147 verdict after a judge’s tally was corrected.

• Rematch (Louisiana Superdome, 25 Nov 1980): Abandoning a slug-fest strategy, Leonard used speed and movement to frustrate Durán. In round eight, after a flush left, Durán turned away and told the referee “no más,” surrendering in shock fashion.

• Aftermath: Durán blamed stomach cramps, but his manager said he quit from embarrassment; Panama reacted angrily and his endorsements were pulled. He regained stature by knocking out Davey Moore for the light-middleweight title on 16 Jun 1983. Leonard later won their 1989 rubber match on points but valued Durán’s 1980 capitulation most of all."
16-1,"World number-one Rory McIlroy says it is “unthinkable” he will finish his career without winning the Masters and completing the career Grand Slam. The 25-year-old, already a winner of the U.S. Open (2011), PGA Championship (2012, 2014) and Open Championship (2014), would become only the sixth player to capture all four majors. He calls his 2011 final-round collapse at Augusta—where he blew a four-shot lead and shot 80—the most important day of his career because it taught him crucial lessons that helped him win later majors. Although he has just one top-10 in six Masters starts, McIlroy feels Augusta National suits him and believes he can win there multiple times. Despite past off-course distractions, he views the golf course as his “sanctuary” and is focusing on playing his best when the tournament begins."

16-4,"A three-bedroom, 1,990 sq ft, unmodernised maisonette in Egerton Place, Knightsbridge, is on sale for £575,000—far below local market levels—because the lease has only three years left.

Both need full renovation.

If a buyer secures a 90-year lease extension (estimated to cost £3.35–£4.5 million from the freeholder, the Wellcome Trust), the smaller flat could be worth about £6 million and the larger around £7.5 million, based on modernised values of £2,750–£3,000 per sq ft. Agents report intense interest, noting that such short-lease opportunities in Knightsbridge are rare, but warn of the “massive premium” required to extend the lease. Egerton Place dates from 1893 and has housed several notable residents."

Normally found in Indonesian, Philippine and Sea of Japan waters, Omura’s whales have a sleek form and distinctive skeletal traits (numerous vertebrae and four digits per pectoral fin). The carcass has been buried so the skeleton can later be recovered for research and potential museum display, helping refine identification guides and map the whale’s distribution."

Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the discovery highly significant because Omura’s whales, first described scientifically in 2003, are little-known and normally inhabit tropical and subtropical waters such as Indonesia, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. The whale’s sleek body and distinctive skeleton—e.g., about 53 vertebrae and four digits per pectoral fin—will aid future research; the carcass has been buried so the skeleton can later be recovered for study and possible museum display."

10-0,"• Russia opened the Su-24 “black box” in Moscow; investigators say key flight data is missing and full analysis is due next week.  
• Data could clarify whether the jet was in Turkish or Syrian airspace when it was hit on 24 November.  
• The shoot-down by Turkish F-16s has severely damaged Russia-Turkey relations: Moscow demands an apology and has imposed sanctions such as banning package holidays.  
• Turkey claims the jet ignored warnings and violated its airspace; Russia insists it was inside Syria, with President Putin accusing Ankara of U.S. subservience and “creeping Islamisation.”  
• Both nations operate in Syria but back opposing sides despite both opposing IS.  
• Incident toll: both Su-24 crew ejected; the pilot was killed by ground militants, the navigator rescued; a Russian marine rescuer was killed and a helicopter destroyed."
10-2,"• An oil-leak triggered explosion struck the paraxylene (PX) plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian, on Monday night, igniting a large fire.  
• Six people were injured (five hurt by flying glass and hospitalized); no toxic chemical spill has been reported.  
• Over 600 firefighters contained the blaze by Tuesday morning.  
• Residents felt the blast and posted images online.  
• The same plant suffered an explosion in July 2013.  
• PX facilities, viewed as pollution risks, have faced repeated—often illegal—protests; this plant was moved from Xiamen to its current remote site after a 2007 public outcry."
10-3,"• Portsmouth Crown Court heard that Davina Ayrton, 34—known as David at the time—raped a 15-year-old girl in a garage in autumn 2004 while two others slept.  
• The victim said she resisted and had consumed little alcohol; she later recalled the events clearly.  
• Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, told a care-home worker in 2014 about the attack.  
• Ayrton denied the charge but was convicted; sentencing is set for 4 March.  
• Judge Ian Pearson remanded her in custody, likely to a male prison in Winchester, citing risks of self-harm and non-attendance.  
• During the trial Ayrton said she has taken no medical steps toward gender transition and changed her name in 2012."
10-4,"The IAAF Council has directly awarded Eugene, USA, the 2021 World Championships, bypassing the normal bid process because it viewed the event as a “unique strategic opportunity” to stage the championships in the United States for the first time. Eugene had lost the 2019 bid to Doha, Qatar, but a recent presentation convinced the Council of its readiness. IAAF President Lamine Diack highlighted coordinated support from public authorities, private partners, the US Olympic Committee and NBC. A similar no-bid decision occurred for Osaka 2007."
13-0,"Doncaster soldier L/Bdr Ben Parkinson, who suffered severe brain injuries in a 2006 Afghanistan bomb attack, carried the Olympic torch for almost 30 minutes on 26 June, aided by an arm-supporting assistant and cheered by hundreds. His nomination praised his recovery, humour and daily 12-hour gym-and-rehab routine; he now walks with crutches and raises funds for military charities as patron of Pilgrim Bandits. The torch appearance triggered an outpouring of support: over 5,000 Facebook friend requests (exceeding the site’s profile limit), 19,000 page hits on one update, heavy e-mail and post, and many invitations to appear with the torch. Facebook suggested he create a public page or use the subscribe feature. Parkinson’s mother Diane called the reaction “phenomenal” and said it has greatly lifted his spirits. He is one of 8,000 torchbearers on the flame’s 8,000-mile, 70-day route to the London 2012 opening ceremony on 27 July."
13-1,"The passage highlights the abrupt handling of pregnancy in Poldark. After only recently revealing Demelza’s pregnancy, the next episode opens with her already eight-months along and, minutes later, she delivers a baby daughter, whom Ross Poldark dotingly admires. Ross reassures Demelza—his former kitchen maid—that she “makes him a better man,” confirming their bond despite viewers’ crushes on the leading man. Fans have mocked the show’s compressed timeline (also seen with Elizabeth’s earlier pregnancy), tweeting that in Poldark “if you are pregnant … expect to have it in the next 10 minutes.”"
13-2,"• Official data show 272 children with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were hospitalised in England in the last 12 months.  
• Experts say the real figure is far higher; WHO research indicates at least 1 % of UK births—about 7,500 babies a year—may suffer learning, behavioural, physical or organ problems from prenatal alcohol exposure.  
• FAS is permanent and widely under-diagnosed, exemplified by 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who needs lifelong support; her adoptive parents founded the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust in 2007.  
• Alcohol use during pregnancy can also cause liver, kidney and heart disorders, cerebral palsy, sight loss and epilepsy.  
• Government advice is no alcohol, or at most two units twice a week, but campaigners argue pregnant women should be told to avoid alcohol entirely."
13-3,"• Scotland’s women have won all five Euro 2017 qualifiers so far and can virtually clinch a finals spot by beating fellow-unbeaten Iceland at Falkirk on Friday; the return game is on 20 September.

• After play-off failures for Euro 2013 and the 2015 World Cup, forward Lisa Evans says missing out again would be “devastating,” though Scotland currently lead the race for automatic qualification (six of eight runners-up also go through).

• Iceland are top seeds, ranked 20th, just above Scotland, and have always given the Scots tough matches.

• Evans, 24, is one of 12 squad members based abroad; she just won the German Bundesliga with Bayern Munich and feels experience in top overseas leagues is raising Scotland’s level.

• She urges a big home crowd, noting fan support can be decisive, and describes the emotional impact if Scotland reach their first major finals."
13-4,"A video from Aero Acres residential airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida captures a light twin-engine Aerostar aircraft landing with no landing gear deployed, scraping its belly and propellers along the runway. Realizing the mistake, the pilot powers up, manages to take off despite damaged propellers, and later flies about 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale, where he lands safely. The pilot, 85-year-old Chris Georgaklis (travelling with his dog Buddy), escaped injury; the FAA is investigating the gear-up incident, which observers say likely resulted from human error or a mechanical fault."

12-1,"Conor McGregor, 26, is set to challenge José Aldo for the featherweight title in Las Vegas on July 11. In the build-up, McGregor revealed a new tiger-face tattoo on his stomach (adding to the gorilla-eating-a-heart design on his chest), posting the image on Instagram with the caption, “If you see the tiger, it’s too late. You’re food.” Aldo will be defending his belt for the eighth time, but McGregor claims the champion lacks his own motivation. Their rivalry intensified during a March promotional stop in Dublin when McGregor seized Aldo’s belt in front of 5,000 fans, underscoring their tense relationship ahead of the bout."
12-3,"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake hit at 15:48 (14:48 GMT) at a 15.5 km depth, with its epicentre in Garfagnana, 35 km north of Lucca. The tremor—described by INGV’s Alessandro Amato as “medium-strong” and “fairly shallow”—was felt in Milan, Florence, Bologna and Modena. No injuries or major damage were immediately reported, though phone and power outages occurred in Garfagnana and nearby schools were evacuated. Several weaker aftershocks followed. The incident comes after two quakes in the same area last May that killed more than 20 people, and echoes Italy’s 2009 L’Aquila disaster (nearly 300 dead), for which six scientists and an ex-official were later convicted of manslaughter over misleading risk assessments."
12-4,"Bobbi Kristina Brown, 22-year-old daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, is no longer in a medically induced coma but remains unresponsive and has “global and irreversible brain damage,” according to her grandmother Cissy Houston and a source familiar with her case. Doctors say she could live in this condition indefinitely: she doesn’t react to voices or movement, her eyes don’t track people, and she has a tracheostomy. While Bobby Brown recently told a concert audience that his daughter was “awake” and family statements note she is out of ICU and beginning a lengthy rehabilitation, relatives and doctors caution that the extent and quality of her future life remain uncertain, and they are hoping for a miracle."
