15599,"Blue Bell Creameries has halted production at its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant after listeria was detected in a 3-oz ice-cream cup made there. The CDC advises consumers and institutions to avoid any Blue Bell products from this plant—specifically 3-oz cups stamped with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T after the date code—though other Blue Bell items from different facilities are not included. The company, already recalling certain items from a Texas plant in early March, is expanding recalls and inspecting the Oklahoma facility “out of an abundance of caution.” Genetic testing shows the listeria from a Kansas hospital sample matches bacteria found in plant samples, while a separate Texas-area illness cluster (2010-2014) also matches recovered product. To date, five Kansas patients were infected and three died; four had consumed Blue Bell milkshakes. The shutdown marks Blue Bell’s first recall in its 108-year history. The CDC urges disposal of any recalled products."
15601,"A Columbia Journalism School review found that Rolling Stone’s UVA gang-rape story was marred by systemic failures in reporting, editing, oversight and fact-checking; Rolling Stone’s managing editor issued a public apology to UVA and Phi Kappa Psi.  
Whether those parties can sue for defamation depends on defamation rules: the plaintiff must show publication of a false, defamatory factual statement made with at least negligent disregard for truth and causing reputational harm.  
UVA itself cannot sue because, as a governmental entity, the government has no defamation cause of action.  
Fraternities face a “group defamation” problem—statements about a group are usually not actionable unless the group is small enough that each member is individually implicated; Phi Kappa Psi might invoke this small-group exception, while Rolling Stone would argue the fraternity’s size and changing membership defeat it.  
Individual fraternity members, treated as private persons, could potentially sue if they clear these hurdles and prove concrete damages, but such libel suits are uncommon and success would hinge on demonstrating specific financial or reputational loss."
15604,"The author, who in 1967 became the first woman and first person of color in the Kentucky State Senate, reacts to Rand Paul’s 2015 presidential announcement. Paul promises to “expand the Republican Party,” yet the author argues his record contradicts any genuine outreach: he has questioned the Civil Rights Act, suggested private businesses may discriminate, down-played the need for stronger voting-rights protections, wants to abolish the Department of Education, opposes abortion rights and DREAMer protections, and has delivered condescending speeches at historically Black colleges. The author concludes that Paul’s positions would take the country backward and make him unfit to lead."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau, now 53, and her husband Vili Fualaau, 31, say they remain happily married nearly a decade after her 2005 prison release and their subsequent wedding. Letourneau, then a 34-year-old Seattle teacher and mother of four, began a 1996 sexual relationship with 13-year-old student Vili, bore his child, and served more than seven years in prison. The couple—now raising two teenage daughters—speak with Barbara Walters on ABC’s “20/20” (airing Friday) ahead of their 10th wedding anniversary on May 20. In the interview, Letourneau discusses how they make their marriage work, her wish to resume teaching, and efforts to end her registered-sex-offender status; Vili addresses his struggles with alcoholism, depression, and feeling failed by the system during his youth."
15616,"• Photographer Daniel Ramos sued Kanye West for assault and camera-grabbing at LAX on July 19, 2013.  
• West had already pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery, receiving two years’ probation, anger-management classes, and community service.  
• Ramos, represented by Gloria Allred, sought general and punitive damages, claiming interference with his lawful work.  
• The civil case, set for trial next week, was dismissed after a confidential settlement that included West’s personal apology; a photo shows the two shaking hands.  
• Allred said the outcome affirms that celebrities “are not above the law.”  
• (Separately noted: West also settled a 2014 Beverly Hills assault allegation.)"
15617,"B.B. King, 89, was briefly hospitalized for dehydration related to his Type II diabetes but reported he was “much better” and left the hospital the same day. According to daughter Claudette King and her publicist Angela Moore, he is now at home resting with his grandchildren. No further medical details or hospital location were given. Known as the “King of the Blues,” King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, holds 30 Grammy nominations, plays Gibson guitars he calls “Lucille,” and is famous for songs such as “The Thrill Is Gone,” “There Must Be a Better World Somewhere,” and “When Love Comes to Town.” He experienced a similar dehydration episode last year that ended a tour."
15623,"Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland and his companion Katrine Saltara were stabbed outside the 1OAK area in Manhattan around 4 a.m. Wednesday, shortly after the pair left the nightclub and walked toward their car near the Fulton Houses. A 22-year-old suspect, who never entered the club, was detained by Copeland’s driver and is in police custody; charges are pending. Copeland suffered wounds to his left elbow and abdomen and is in stable condition, while Saltara and a second woman also sustained slash injuries. Atlanta Hawks players Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha, who had arrived in New York after playing in Atlanta earlier that night, were arrested at the scene for obstructing governmental administration, disorderly conduct, and (for Sefolosha) resisting arrest after pushing through the crowd; police say they were not involved in the stabbing itself. Both NBA teams, along with the league, are gathering information, and neither Antic nor Sefolosha will suit up for the Hawks’ Wednesday game against the Nets."
15627,"Selena’s family is developing “Selena the One,” a full-body digital recreation of the Tejano star who was killed 20 years ago. Built by Nevada tech firm Acrovirt LLC, the project aims to create a walking, talking, singing and dancing likeness using the company’s “Digitized Human Essence” technology. Planned outcomes include new songs, videos, collaborations with current artists and a 2018 tour. Selena will be the first person to use this technology, a point her sister Suzette Quintanilla calls “amazing,” emphasizing it will extend—not replace—Selena’s legacy, which still draws 2 million Facebook followers. Funding is sought through an Indiegogo campaign launching April 16 at selenatheone.com, with a commemorative Fiesta de la Flor scheduled in Corpus Christi on April 17–18."
15628,"Alaska Airlines Flight 448 left Seattle for Los Angeles on Monday but returned after 14 minutes when the crew and passengers heard banging and faint cries from the forward cargo hold. The noise came from a Menzies Aviation ramp agent who had accidentally fallen asleep among the luggage before takeoff. The pressurized, temperature-controlled hold kept him safe, and he was hospitalized briefly and passed a drug test. His shift had begun at 5 a.m. and was to end at 2:30 p.m.; coworkers assumed he had gone home when they couldn’t find him. After the precautionary landing and investigation by emergency responders, the flight—carrying 170 passengers and six crew—later continued to Los Angeles. Alaska Airlines is investigating the incident."
15634,"Emy Afalava, born in American Samoa (a U.S. territory since 1900), has spent his life under U.S. law yet is barred from voting because the federal government says he is not a citizen. He and other American Samoans are challenging this in a pending D.C. Circuit lawsuit, citing the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee that anyone born “in the United States” is a citizen. Birth-on-U.S.-soil citizenship has been standard since the nation’s founding, but racist exceptions have appeared: the 1857 Dred Scott decision denied citizenship to free African-Americans; early-20th-century rulings on island territories, exemplified by Isabel Gonzalez’s Puerto Rico case, treated territorial residents as politically inferior due to alleged racial unfitness. While inhabitants of every other U.S. island territory have since gained citizenship, American Samoans remain the only Americans still denied it."
15638,"Somali-Canadian sisters Iman (25) and Siham Hashi (27) form the pop duo Faarrow. After fleeing Mogadishu in 1991 and growing up in Canada, they moved through Atlanta to Los Angeles, where they are finishing a Warner Bros. debut album co-written and produced with actor-musician Elijah Kelley. Their sound fuses pop with hip-hop and African percussion, reflecting influences from Michael Jackson and the Spice Girls to Sia. Beyond music, the pair act as UNHCR spokespeople, stage benefit concerts, and run the socially conscious jewelry line “Wish Creatively” (Women Internationally Selling Hope) to fund projects for Somali and Kenyan women. They see their growing musical platform as a way to inspire others and expand their humanitarian work."
15651,"At a Vatican Mass marking the centenary of the 1915–16 slaughter of more than 1 million Armenians, Pope Francis quoted a 2001 John Paul II document, calling the killings “the first genocide of the 20th century.” Earlier popes had either hidden the term in writing (John Paul II) or avoided it (Benedict XVI). By citing his predecessor, Francis signaled continuity while still risking Turkish ire; Ankara immediately recalled its ambassador and condemned the remark as “unacceptable.” The episode illustrates the pope’s recurring dilemma of prophetic bluntness versus diplomatic caution, a tension visible in other initiatives such as his roles in U.S.–Cuba rapprochement and Middle-East peace efforts. The next day Francis urged priests to speak boldly, saying, “We cannot keep silent about what we have seen and heard.”"
15652,"During National Park Week (April 18–26), the National Park Service and National Park Foundation will waive entrance fees at all 128 normally fee-charging U.S. national parks for two days—Saturday and Sunday. Visitors can enjoy special activities such as night-time astronomy parties, Revolutionary War programs, Earth Day events, and Junior Ranger offerings.

15661,"TEPCO sent a second remote-controlled robot into Fukushima’s damaged reactor on April 15 after the first, dispatched April 10, became stranded by debris. The new probe recorded unexpectedly low radiation and temperature levels—evidence the cooling system is functioning—and captured images showing a mysterious green glow and yellow grating discoloration, although the glow was not visible from other angles and its cause is unknown. The first robot gathered radiation readings at 14 of 18 spots before its cable was cut; the second completed data collection at all 11 planned points. While the site remains too dangerous for humans, the collected data are viewed as important progress toward decommissioning, a task expected to take years and cost about $50 billion."
15665,"After finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev guilty on all counts for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, jurors entered the penalty phase to decide between a death sentence or life imprisonment. Prosecutors used victim-impact testimony to illustrate the human toll. They honored the four people Tsarnaev killed—Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, Martin Richard and police officer Sean Collier—through photos and family memories, while emphasizing the cruelty of their final moments. A courtroom image of Tsarnaev giving a middle-finger salute was shown to argue his lack of remorse. Survivors also described their ordeals: high-school senior Gillian Reny recounted seeing her shattered leg and fearing death, and Celeste Corcoran detailed losing both legs and living with constant pain. The testimony aimed to convey the physical devastation and lasting emotional grief caused by Tsarnaev’s bombs."
15667,"The 50th Academy of Country Music Awards, held at AT&T Stadium in Texas, was the show’s largest staging yet, even setting a Guinness record for biggest live-TV awards-show audience. Billboard’s recap names 10 standout moments: 
• Eric Church and Keith Urban’s joint opener  
• Reba McEntire’s powerhouse vocal return  
• Taylor Swift enthusiastically singing along in the crowd  
• Garth Brooks’ military salute during “All-American Kid”  
• Taylor Swift’s mother presenting her with a special award amid news of her cancer diagnosis  
• Christina Aguilera pairing smoothly with Rascal Flatts  
• Miranda Lambert’s duet medley and multiple award wins  
• Little Big Town’s resolute performance of “Girl Crush”  
• Jason Aldean’s strong vocal medley  
• The record-setting audience itself.  

Five low points were also cited: 
• Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo’s drawn-out football gag  
• The show’s excessive 3½-hour length  
• Milestone Awards for Reba, Kenny Chesney and George Strait that felt rushed  
• Steven Tyler’s questionable facial hair  
• Twitter backlash toward Taylor Swift for “leaving” country music."
15670,"Polish aristocrat Prince Jan Zylinski, angered by perceived anti-Polish rhetoric, released a YouTube video challenging UKIP leader Nigel Farage to a sword duel in London’s Hyde Park—or, failing that, to a televised debate. Zylinski condemned Farage’s comments linking Eastern European immigration to problems such as motorway congestion and highlighted Polish contributions to Britain. Farage, campaigning for the 7 May general election, declined the duel; a spokesman reiterated UKIP’s stance that EU free movement harms the UK and noted Poland’s loss of young workers. UKIP favors quitting the EU and cutting foreign aid. Another UKIP member tweeted an image suggesting Farage would win a duel. Zylinski also posted a second video listing “7 reasons why the British should love the Poles” and called for an end to hostility toward Polish immigrants."
15673,"A Cessna 414 carrying seven people, including Illinois State University associate men’s basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch, crashed overnight Monday about two miles east of Central Illinois Regional Airport near Bloomington, roughly five miles from the ISU campus. The group was returning from the NCAA men’s basketball championship game in Indianapolis. All aboard were killed. ISU President Larry Dietz and Athletic Director Larry Lyons praised Ward—a former UAB star and ISU coach since 2012—and Leetch—an ISU athletics administrator since 2005 (with a brief stint away)—and expressed the university community’s deep grief over the loss."
15683,"In the sentencing phase of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s trial, prosecutors rested after three days of graphic survivor testimony meant to show his cruelty, while the defense—led by Judy Clarke—will start Monday, likely stressing his troubled upbringing. 

Key testimony:
• Steve Woolfenden lost his left leg while shielding his 3-year-old son Leo, who was also hurt.  
• Trauma surgeon Dr. David King likened the civilian wounds to war injuries.  
• Heather Abbott chose below-knee amputation after three failed attempts to save her shattered foot.  
• Marc Fucarile lost his right leg, suffered severe burns, needs over 70 pills daily, and may still lose his left leg.  
• Video of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who died from massive shrapnel injuries, underscored the blast’s brutality; his parents, who oppose the death penalty, did not join this phase.

A group of Tsarnaev relatives has arrived in Boston, though it is unclear if they will testify. The jury now decides whether the 21-year-old will receive the death penalty or life in prison."
15690,"Sofia Vergara’s former fiancé, businessman Nick Loeb, has filed an anonymous Los Angeles lawsuit (“Joe Doe” v. “Jane Doe”) to stop the destruction of the pair’s two frozen, female embryos created through IVF in November 2013 while they were engaged.  
Key points:  
• Loeb, confirmed as the plaintiff by his lawyer, asks that the embryos be preserved and ultimately implanted in a surrogate; he offers to waive any parental or financial obligations for Vergara.  
• The suit also names the Beverly Hills clinic storing the embryos and states no action may be taken without agreement from both parties. Two previous surrogate implantations had failed.  
• Legal specialists note that, absent a prior agreement, courts must decide whether the embryos are treated as life or property; California law generally blocks destruction if either creator objects, making the case a “gray area” with moral, religious and contractual implications.  
• Vergara’s representatives declined comment; she is currently promoting her film “Hot Pursuit” and is engaged to actor Joe Manganiello."
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, a 65-year-old grandmother from Luxor, Egypt, has passed as a man for 43 years. Widowed at 21 while six months pregnant, she adopted male dress (a jalabiya) to escape social restrictions on women and earn money to raise her daughter, Houda. Dahou worked first as a brick maker for a few piasters, then as a shoeshiner, ultimately supporting both Houda and her grandchildren. Her decades in the sun have given her a rough, masculine appearance, and she refuses to wear women’s clothing. After a televised interview about her life, Luxor’s governor granted her a kiosk and cash advance—terms she accepted only while dressed as a man. Last month President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi honored her as one of Egypt’s “ideal mothers,” recognition she says validates the sacrifices she made to protect and educate her daughter."
15695,"A Massachusetts jury spent more than 35 hours across seven days weighing testimony from 130+ witnesses and 400+ exhibits before finding former NFL player Aaron Hernandez guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting of Odin Lloyd. In interviews, foreperson Lesa Strachan and jurors Rosalie Oliver, Kelly Dorsey, and Jon Carlson described the process as emotionally draining and far different from TV portrayals. Key factors included the brutality of six shots and Hernandez’s “indifference,” highlighted by video of him relaxing poolside with co-defendants Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace hours after the killing. Jurors said Hernandez’s football fame and whether he personally pulled the trigger were irrelevant; his participation and lack of concern were decisive. The conviction carries life without parole. Ortiz and Wallace will be tried separately."
15696,"SkyWest Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 with 84 passengers and nine crew en route from Chicago to Hartford, diverted to Buffalo on Wednesday for an emergency landing after the crew announced a pressurization problem and a rapid 28,000-foot descent in three minutes. Passengers reported dizziness, vision problems and a sense of helplessness; three briefly lost consciousness, and 15 were checked by medics on arrival, though none required hospital transport. On board, nurse Mary Cunningham treated two women who became gray and lethargic before she herself felt light-headed. The FAA first cited a pressurization issue, then issued a later statement omitting that reference; SkyWest says maintenance found no pressurization fault, and both the airline and the NTSB are still investigating."
15700,"Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting of friend Odin Lloyd and sentenced to life without parole, along with firearm and ammunition convictions. Throughout the trial Hernandez showed no remorse—winking at fiancée Shayanna Jenkins, maintaining swagger, and offering no credible alibi; even his lawyer only claimed he “witnessed” the killing. Commentators fixated on his arrogance, yet the jury relied on extensive circumstantial evidence to reach what the author calls the correct verdict. The case is seen as a tragic waste of two lives. Hernandez’s troubles began after his father’s 2006 death: despite collegiate football stardom at Florida, he accumulated bar fights, drug issues, and shooting inquiries, entering the NFL already labeled “troubled.” The Patriots cut him hours after the murder charge and, with the league, are deemed blameless; Hernandez’s downfall is portrayed as unpredictable and solely his own responsibility."
15702,"Louis Jordan, 37, was found by the container ship Houston Express after drifting for 66 days on his 35-foot sailboat “Angel,” hundreds of miles from land. Shortly after leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish, a storm capsized the boat, broke its mast and injured Jordan’s shoulder; the vessel overturned twice more while he improvised a small sail that could not overcome the currents. Once his supplies ran out he survived by collecting rainwater—eventually filling a 25-gallon tank—and netting fish that gathered in clothes he rinsed overboard. Rescued Thursday, he was air-lifted to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, where he walked off the helicopter with only dehydration and hunger despite expectations of severe sunburn or weight loss; time spent inside the cabin likely protected him. The Coast Guard, first alerted by his father on January 29, accepts his account. Jordan, an unemployed truck driver who had lived aboard the boat at a Conway marina, attributes his endurance to physical resilience and constant prayer."
15708,"• French crash prosecutor Brice Robin says investigators have seen no video from inside Germanwings Flight 9525 and urges anyone who has such footage to hand it over.  
• Magazines Paris Match and Bild claim they viewed a cell-phone video taken during the jet’s final seconds, describing screams, banging on the cockpit door and escalating chaos; they have not published the clip.  
• France’s BEA agency and Gendarmerie spokesman Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini call the video reports wrong, noting cell phones from the crash have been collected but not yet examined or sent to a forensic lab; Menichini rules out any leak. Bild’s editor says the outlets remain confident the video is genuine.  
• Lufthansa now confirms co-pilot Andreas Lubitz disclosed a “severe depression” episode to its flight school in 2009; despite this, he completed training, held valid medical certificates and was judged “fit to fly.”  
• Investigators say Lubitz previously had suicidal tendencies and recent psychological and eye consultations that deemed him unfit to work; one theory is he feared losing his license, though no evidence shows he was suicidal or aggressive just before the crash.  
• Recovery teams report no visible human remains remain at the Alpine site; DNA identification of all 150 victims may finish this week, and collection of passengers’ belongings is beginning. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr visited the area and laid a wreath."
15714,"A dry-docked Russian nuclear submarine undergoing repairs at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire when rubber insulation between its light and pressure hull ignited during welding. The vessel has had its nuclear fuel, armaments, and other hazardous materials removed since repairs began in November 2013. All personnel evacuated safely, no injuries were reported, and officials say the blaze poses no threat to people or the facility."
15733,"HBO’s new documentary “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,” drawn from Lawrence Wright’s book, is critical of the Church of Scientology. Actor and long-time Scientologist John Travolta—promoting his film “The Forger” in Clearwater, Florida—says he has neither watched nor intends to watch it. Travolta dismisses the film as the work of “disgruntled” former members, asserts that his 40-year experience with Scientology has been wholly positive, and calls the religion “brilliant,” crediting it with helping him cope after his son Jett’s 2009 death. He therefore sees no reason to comment on allegations he has not personally encountered, and believes fellow Scientologist Tom Cruise would feel similarly."
15735,"At Walt Disney World Speedway’s Exotic Driving Experience on Sunday, a Lamborghini crashed into a guardrail. Passenger Gary Terry, 36, of Davenport, Florida, died at the scene; driver Tavon Watson, 24, of Kissimmee, sustained minor injuries and was hospitalized. Petty Holdings, operator of the attraction (and of the Richard Petty Driving Experience), expressed condolences over the incident."
15739,"A gastrointestinal outbreak on the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity has sickened 100 people—95 of the 2,117 passengers and 5 of the 964 crew—according to the CDC. The cause is still unknown; two CDC staff will board the West-Coast-based vessel when it arrives in San Diego on Monday. The ship departed San Diego on March 29 and last called at Puerto Vallarta on April 10. Celebrity Cruises has stepped up cleaning, disinfection, passenger updates, and specimen collection for CDC testing. This is the ship’s third such outbreak (previously in 2006 and 2013); the vessel was built in 2001 and refurbished in 2011."
15740,"Almost 2,000 pieces of World War I graffiti have been found in a vast chalk-quarry “underground city” beneath the battlefields near Naours, 120 miles north of Paris. National Geographic photographer and ER doctor Jeff Gusky, who calls the site “The Hidden World of WWI,” has so far recorded 1,821 names: roughly 40 % Australian, many British, 55 American and 662 still untraced. The tunnels, centuries old, were sealed in the 18th century, rediscovered in the late 19th, and used by soldiers in 1916 when the Somme front lay only miles away. Dark, maze-like passages—some with stone-carved maps—hid the men whose fresh-looking inscriptions include “HJ Leach. Merely a private. 13/7/16” and others from Sydney and New York. The land, long private and largely unseen, passed to a village consortium in 2013, enabling ongoing exploration that highlights these soldiers’ last personal marks, many made shortly before they were killed."
15744,"Rolling Stone has retracted its gang-rape story, but the undisputed backdrop remains: the University of Virginia’s (UVA) record on sexual assault is under multiple investigations and scrutiny.  
• UVA has never expelled a student for sexual assault, even in admitted cases, despite expelling 183 students since 1998 for honor-code violations such as cheating.  
• The Virginia attorney general hired O’Melveny & Myers to review UVA’s historical handling of assault allegations, including those by “Jackie,” whose 2012 fraternity-house rape claim was central to the discredited article. Jackie informed UVA in 2013, but police first learned of it in 2014 during a separate bottle-throwing incident; she twice declined to cooperate with police.  
• A federal Title IX investigation is also open, and a civil suit alleges UVA medical staff lost or destroyed assault evidence.  
• After the article, UVA announced an undefined “zero-tolerance” sexual-assault policy.  
• Numerous women told CNN that campus culture minimizes rape (“bad experience”), brands certain fraternities as “rapey,” and discourages reporting because offenders are rarely removed.  
• Columbia Journalism School found Rolling Stone’s failure to verify Jackie’s account with her friends—who say they would have contradicted it—caused the article’s collapse, overshadowing broader, more common acquaintance-rape issues at UVA.  
• Survivors fear the retraction will silence victims, yet observers note it still forced needed discussion and policy attention. Unresolved questions about UVA’s response to sexual assault persist."
15747,"Jia Jiang, a Chinese-born entrepreneur in the U.S., left a six-figure job at 30 (just before his first child’s birth) and, after his start-up was denied funding, created the “100 Days of Rejection” blog to face his fear of being turned down. During the project he made daily, sometimes odd, requests—e.g., asking a Krispy Kreme manager to make interlinked Olympic-ring donuts; her agreement went viral and brought him national media attention and speaking offers. Jiang’s experience led to his new book, “Rejection Proof,” which blends autobiography, motivation, and self-help aimed at showing that rejection can become opportunity. He distills his lessons into eight key tips: 1) fear, not rejection itself, is the bigger barrier; 2) persistence turns “no” into “yes”; 3) rejection doesn’t judge an idea’s worth; 4) stay engaged after a “no”; 5) ask why and adjust; 6) decide how many refusals you can absorb; 7) build “rejection muscle” until you feel invincible; 8) remember rejection is just one person’s opinion—stand tall. Overall, Jiang’s mission is to demystify rejection for himself and others."
15753,"• In the past year Ebola has infected over 25,000 people and killed more than 10,000.  
• Though the crisis has eased, it remains the largest Ebola outbreak on record and highlighted serious weaknesses in global public-health systems.  
• As of the week of April 5, 30 new cases were reported—the lowest weekly total since May 2014—but “dozens” are still being infected each week.  
• Liberia and Sierra Leone now have so few patients that treatment centers are being closed; WHO is decommissioning surplus facilities in Liberia.  
• Guinea is still struggling: of 19 Ebola deaths that week, seven were only recognized after death and 21 unsafe burials occurred, suggesting hidden transmission chains.  
• Survivors’ lives are permanently altered, and the broader population has been deeply affected; accompanying photos (not shown here) illustrate personal stories from the outbreak."
15759,"The writer, a defense attorney, reflects on video showing Officer Michael Slager shooting the fleeing, unarmed Walter Scott, handcuffing him as he dies, and apparently planting evidence. The video—captured by a bystander—prevents the incident from being hidden behind an “active investigation” and will be vital for justice. The author argues that a police body-worn camera could have deterred Slager from shooting, falsifying his report, or letting Scott die, thereby saving both lives and careers. Although body cameras and data storage are costly, those expenses pale beside potential civil-suit damages and, more importantly, the value of a human life. With public trust in policing eroding and tension between minorities and officers escalating, cameras can reduce complaints and use-of-force incidents, breaking a destructive cycle. Still, cameras are only a stopgap; the deeper issue is systemic bias against black men that drives disproportionate shootings. Long-term solutions include stricter hiring standards, bias training, and broad social reforms to address racial disparities, but until then, universal police body cameras can at least expose and curb lethal bias."
15778,"• In Shariya refugee camp near Duhok, Iraqi Kurdistan, about 4,000 tents now shelter thousands of Yazidis who fled ISIS’ August assault on Sinjar.  
• Camp residents Mahmoud and his wife Ahlam recount that ISIS seized Ahlam, their three small children and Mahmoud’s elderly parents while Mahmoud was away.  
• The captives were shuttled between Tal Afar, Mosul and an abandoned Shia village, forced to herd goats and watched constantly; escapees were brutally executed.  
• Using a hidden phone, Ahlam kept brief contact with Mahmoud, then fled at midnight with her children and 30-plus others, reaching Kurdish-held territory after eight months in captivity.  
• Days later ISIS unexpectedly freed 217 Yazidis—mostly elderly, some children—among them Mahmoud’s parents; Ahlam’s parents remain imprisoned.  
• Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil, travelling with Iraq’s prime minister to the U.N., is urging greater international action and airstrikes to rescue remaining captives, calling the situation “inconceivable” in the 21st century."
15779,"American educator Debra Lobo, a 55-year-old California native and vice principal of Karachi’s Jinnah Medical and Dental College, was shot Thursday while driving from work to pick up her daughters. Two gunmen on a motorcycle wounded her in the cheek and arm; she is unconscious but expected to survive and is being treated at Aga Khan Hospital. Police recovered Urdu pamphlets in her car saying “America should be burnt,” are investigating the attack, and are coordinating with the U.S. Consulate. Lobo, a Karachi resident since 1996, is married to a Pakistani Christian librarian."
15786,"• While staying at a rented villa in the Sirenusa resort on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, Delaware father Steve Esmond, his wife Theresa Devine, and their two sons (16 and 14) suddenly became ill on March 20, six days after checking in.  
• Paramedics found Esmond unconscious and the others seizing; all were air-lifted to U.S. hospitals.  
  – The boys remain in comas and in critical condition; Esmond is conscious but cannot talk or move; Devine has been released and is in therapy.  
• Preliminary EPA tests detected the restricted pesticide methyl bromide in the family’s unit; indoor use of this chemical is prohibited because of its acute toxicity. Final results are pending, and the EPA is assessing whether a March 18 fumigation violated regulations.  
• Sea Glass Vacations, the rental agent, says only the unit beneath the family’s was recently treated, using Terminix.  
• The U.S. Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation; Terminix’s parent company, ServiceMaster, disclosed the probe and says it is cooperating."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association has formally barred its members from any involvement in executions, declaring such participation incompatible with pharmacists’ healthcare role. The policy, adopted at the group’s annual meeting, reinforces earlier stances opposing both the labeling of lethal‐injection chemicals as “drugs” and any laws compelling or forbidding pharmacists’ participation. Spurred by recent scrutiny of botched or delayed lethal injections—such as Clayton Lockett’s 2014 execution and a postponed Georgia execution—the move comes amid nationwide drug shortages after manufacturers like Lundbeck stopped supplying pentobarbital. With 32 states still allowing capital punishment, some, like Utah, have revived firing squads due to the scarcity of lethal‐injection drugs. The association’s new position aligns with similar prohibitions by the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, and American Board of Anesthesiology."
15791,"At a National Public Health Week roundtable at Howard University, President Obama, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy promoted a new way to discuss climate change: emphasize its direct effects on human health rather than abstract emissions debates. Speakers cited:  

• Worsening asthma—personal for Murthy—and broader respiratory problems.  
• An American Thoracic Society survey in which 70 % of doctors already see climate-related health impacts.  
• EPA data: U.S. temperature up 1.4 °F in the past century, another 2 °F rise expected, bringing more heat waves, floods and droughts; health outcomes will vary by region, age, and resources.  
• WHO estimates of 250,000 additional annual deaths (2030-2050) from malaria, diarrhea, heat and under-nutrition, on top of today’s 7 million air-pollution deaths. Children, the elderly and developing nations are most at risk.

Obama highlighted past Clean Air Act successes, new tech tools (e.g., real-time air-quality apps), and urged public pressure for bold action, while polls show sizeable climate-change skepticism remains."
15800,"Wang Pingan, a recent university graduate cycling around China on a shoestring budget, had his pannier-laden mountain bike stolen in Shenzhen just days before completing a 460-day, 29,200-kilometer journey through every major province. Police used surveillance footage to find the bike, which had already changed hands twice, and returned it to him so he can finish his route to Hainan Island. Wang, who sees the inexpensive bike as a cherished companion after traveling to places such as Mohe, Urumqi and Xishuangbanna, had vowed to walk rather than replace it and had declined offers of a new bicycle."
15817,"Tens of thousands of people from more than 20 countries now use Libya as the main springboard to Europe; in 2014 over 80 % of would-be migrants headed for its coast.  
Motives differ by nationality:  

• Eritreans escape authoritarian rule, poverty and open-ended conscription; many pay several thousand dollars and, together with Syrians, formed about half of last year’s flow.  
• Syrians, having lost hope of returning home or surviving in neighboring states, now buy “packages” that cover desert and sea travel.  
• Somalis flee Al-Shabaab, clan warfare and destitution; one survivor put the chance of dying en route at “95 %.”  
• West Africans—from Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Gambia, Nigeria and others—mainly seek work; most are single men in their twenties spurred by swelling populations, shrinking farmland and family pressure to remit money. Boko Haram violence and Mali’s recent conflict add to the exodus.  

Smuggling follows established relays: Eritreans move through Sudan; West Africans funnel through Agadez (Niger), Khartoum, or Tamanrasset (Algeria). A truck ride to southern Libya can cost about $300; 2,000–7,000 migrants pass Agadez monthly. Inside Libya, small smuggler groups based in towns like Sabha and Qatrun use “connection houses,” charge roughly $200 for the desert leg, and hand travelers unseaworthy boats, GPS devices and no crew. Syrians can pay extra for upper-deck spots; Africans are often locked below.  

Libya’s turmoil, ISIS killings, and abandoned border posts ease departures but heighten risks—kidnapping, robbery, starvation, drowning, and for some women, rising trafficking for prostitution. Neighboring states are erecting fences, yet most paths remain open, sustaining the dangerous “funnel to Europe.”"
11317,"• Religious-freedom bills in Arkansas and Indiana triggered wide corporate backlash; Walmart’s forceful opposition in its home state stood out.  
• Walmart CEO Doug McMillon urged Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto Arkansas’s bill; Hutchinson then refused to sign it without changes, marking a victory for the company.  
• The stance follows Walmart’s February decision to raise wages and reflects a broader evolution: adding gender-identity protections in 2011 and extending health benefits to same-sex partners in 2013.  
• Once heavily Republican in its political giving (about $2 million to Republicans vs. <$500 k to Democrats in 2004), Walmart’s PAC spending gap narrowed to $1.3 million vs. $970 k in 2014.  
• Former GOP governor Tim Pawlenty cites Walmart as a signal that Republicans must address middle-class concerns, consider minimum-wage hikes, and back anti-discrimination measures.  
• Other businesses—Apple, NCAA, Angie’s List, NASCAR, etc.—also condemned the laws, underscoring a view summarized by the Human Rights Campaign: “equality is good for business.”  
• The debate pressures national politicians: Jeb Bush softened earlier support for Indiana’s law; Ted Cruz defended it and criticized corporate opposition; Hillary Clinton urged an Arkansas veto.  
• Retail analysts say Walmart’s positions mirror its diverse customer base and rising national support (59%) for same-sex marriage."
11323,"Easter marks the Crucifixion (atonement) and Resurrection (victory over death) of Jesus, but over time it has gathered shifting dates and folk customs.  

1. Date and astronomy  
• The Council of Nicaea (325) set Easter as the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox; if that full moon is a Sunday, Easter moves one week later.  
• Because the rule depends on lunar phases—also used to fix Passover—Easter moves through spring and can coincide with “blood-moon” lunar eclipses.  
• Western churches use the Gregorian calendar; Eastern Orthodox churches keep the Julian calendar, so they usually celebrate a week later. A 1997 bid to standardize the date failed.

2. Current observances  
• At the Vatican, Holy Week runs from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday Mass. Pope Francis celebrated outdoors in the rain, washed believers’ feet, and in his Urbi et Orbi address appealed for an end to suffering in Nigeria, South Sudan, Iraq and Ukraine.  
• In Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulcher—site of Calvary and Christ’s tomb—Catholics and Armenian Christians held Easter rites; Orthodox Christians will follow next week.

3. Folk symbols  
• Eggs and the Easter Bunny surfaced in German tradition; the first written mention (Alsace, 1682) links a bunny with eggs. German immigrants carried the custom to North America in the 1700s.  
• One explanation: during Lent people abstained from eggs, boiled the surplus, then hid, colored or gifted them at Easter, inventing the bunny tale for children.

4. Modern tip  
• To dye eggs without vinegar, use a packet of Kool-Aid in hot water; colors are vivid but the mixture stains easily.

Thus, Easter combines its core religious meaning with movable timing, split calendars, and enduring egg-and-bunny lore."
11332,"In Japan’s Upper House, ex-wrestler and current lawmaker Antonio Inoki asked whether the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) had ever scrambled jets or conducted research in response to extraterrestrial UFOs. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani replied that, while fighters are dispatched to investigate unidentified objects that might breach Japanese airspace, none have ever been judged to originate from beyond Earth; sightings typically turn out to be birds or other mundane items. Inoki—famed for his 1976 bout with Muhammad Ali, his pro-wrestling career, varied media appearances, and unorthodox diplomatic forays—claims to have seen a UFO himself but admits uncertainty about alien life. The Diet exchange echoes a 2007 discussion when then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba mused about constitutional issues tied to a hypothetical alien invasion."
11349,"Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old Indiana basketball player for Mount St. Joseph University, has died from the inoperable brain tumor (diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma) she was diagnosed with in 2013. After committing to the team, the school obtained NCAA approval to move up its 2014–15 season opener so she could fulfill her dream of playing college basketball; before a sellout crowd she scored the game’s first and last baskets. Hill used her remaining time to promote hope and perseverance, publicly urging people to “cherish every moment,” and helped raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research through The Cure Starts Now. Tributes after her death praised her courage and impact, including words from head coach Dan Benjamin, university president Tony Artez, high-school principal Bill Snyder, NBA star LeBron James, and NCAA President Mark Emmert, who all described her as an inspiration whose legacy will endure."
11353,"A 20-30-foot fiberglass boat fragment, believed to have drifted from Japan after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami, was found off the Oregon coast and towed to Newport. Inside were yellowtail jack fish native to Japanese waters. Biologists judged the invasive-species risk minimal. The boat debris will be dried, further inspected, and landfilled, while the fish will be housed at the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Richie Benaud, former Australia cricket captain and globally renowned commentator, has died aged 84 after treatment for skin cancer. A leg-spin all-rounder, he played 64 Tests, captained Australia from 1958-64 without losing a series, became the first player to reach 2,000 Test runs and 200 wickets, and entered the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. Post-retirement he spent more than 40 years with the BBC and became cricket’s most celebrated—and most imitated—broadcast voice, famed for succinct, witty observations. Tributes poured in from figures such as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, British Prime Minister David Cameron, current captain Michael Clarke, Shane Warne, Imran Khan and Kumar Sangakkara, all lauding his playing record, commentary excellence and personal integrity."
11356,"NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer has named Asteroid 316201, which she discovered in June 2010, “316201 Malala (2010 ML48)” in honor of Pakistani education activist and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Malala Yousafzai, who survived a Taliban shooting and continues to champion girls’ schooling. Mainzer highlighted the scarcity of celestial names recognizing women, especially women of color. The asteroid, about 4 km wide, is very dark, orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, and completes a revolution roughly every 5½ years. Mainzer, who also advises a PBS children’s science show, supports Malala’s cause because educating girls expands global brainpower needed to tackle humanity’s challenges."
11366,"An explosion about 8:30 p.m. Thursday outside the Bauchi Motor Park in Gombe, northeast Nigeria, killed at least five people and injured more than a dozen. Witnesses said a woman feigned travel to Jos, left a handbag packed with explosives beside a passenger bus, then walked away before it detonated and set the bus on fire. No group has claimed responsibility, but Boko Haram—under pressure from a four-nation military offensive and increasingly striking soft targets—is the prime suspect. The blast is the first attack since last weekend’s presidential election won by Muhammadu Buhari, who has pledged to defeat Boko Haram."
11370,"At the Panama Summit of the Americas, the headline moment was President Obama’s first handshake with Cuban President Raúl Castro, symbolizing efforts to normalize U.S.–Cuba relations. Obama hopes the summit can do more: reclaim U.S. influence in Latin America, which has waned as China, Russia and Iran expand their reach. Previous hemispheric meetings hurt U.S. standing—2009’s Hugo Chávez photo-op and 2012’s Cartagena prostitution scandal—while U.S. exclusion of Cuba alienated regional leaders. Although Obama arrives with his Cuba opening, new sanctions on Venezuela risk handing President Nicolás Maduro anti-U.S. propaganda. The region is troubled by democratic backsliding, corruption and poverty, creating an opening for Washington to champion democracy, human rights and economic growth. A disciplined, controversy-free performance in Panama, paired with a clear vision of partnership, could help the United States rebuild ties beyond the historic handshake."
11384,"The author recounts being groped in a packed Mumbai train at age 13, an incident that led to a lifelong aversion to trains and was kept secret for years. She notes that such harassment—ranging from groping and stalking to leering and catcalling—is widespread in India’s public spaces:

• A We the People study found 80 % of Mumbai women have faced street harassment, especially on trains and platforms.  
• In workshops the author has held for 2,000 women, almost all had been harassed, yet fewer than ten had ever filed a formal complaint.  
• Most women react by restricting their movements or appearance rather than reporting incidents, hindered by shame, fear of family “disrepute,” and unhelpful police practices.

Although India has laws against sexual violence in public and at work, cultural and procedural barriers limit their use. Still, two recent cases show reporting can have impact: allegations against environmental leader Rajendra Pachauri led to his resignation from the U.N. climate panel, and journalist Tarun Tejpal was arrested (though later granted interim bail) for assaulting an employee. 

The author now works to encourage women to share their stories, assert their legal rights, and enlist supportive allies, arguing that breaking the silence is essential to ending everyday sexual harassment and enabling women to live freely."
11395,"Climbers are back on Mount Everest after 2014’s avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall killed 16 Nepalis and ended the season. To lower risk, a Sherpa-led committee has replaced the faster but exposed route with a longer central line through the Icefall, requiring more ladder crossings and a gear-weight limit. Nepal has issued 347 climbing permits (up from 334), yet safety worries have prompted at least one company, Alpenglow Expeditions, to switch to Tibet’s northern route, where 320 climbers are registered—136 more than last year. The potential shift concerns Nepali operators who rely on Everest tourism, while Sherpa guides face family anxiety after last year’s losses. Some individual climbers, such as Jon Reiter, are also returning despite the tragedy, drawn again to attempt the summit."
11400,"The article argues that the new push for consumer-ordered lab testing—encouraged by figures like Mark Cuban, Taylor Swift and Arizona’s governor—will likely harm rather than help healthy people. With more than a thousand possible lab tests, direct-to-consumer services are expanding, but frequent testing mainly produces “abnormal” results that are common in healthy individuals. Those results trigger extra doctor visits, further tests, anxiety, invasive procedures and overtreatment (as seen with prostate, breast and thyroid cancer), all at rising cost. While diagnostics are invaluable for actual illness, routine testing of the well seldom improves health. The author calls for FDA regulation and public education about the limits and risks of self-testing, concluding that exercising the “freedom to test” is usually unnecessary and potentially detrimental."
11410,"Canada has extended its anti-ISIS mission from Iraq into Syria. On Wednesday, two CF-18 Hornets carried out Canada’s first Syrian airstrike, successfully hitting an ISIS garrison near Raqqa, the group’s de facto capital, and then returned safely to base. The action follows Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s recent decision to broaden the mandate of Canada’s participation in the U.S.-led coalition. Defense Minister Jason Kenney said the strike shows Canada’s resolve to combat “a genocidal terrorist organization” and deny ISIS safe haven. Casualty figures from the attack are not yet known."
11768,"• Danielle and Adam Busby of Houston welcomed the first all-female quintuplets born worldwide since 1969—Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige—on April 8 at 28 weeks; mother Danielle conceived through intrauterine insemination, blogs at “It’s a Buzz World,” and the family now numbers eight.  
• Although initially reported as a U.S. first, an earlier all-girl quintuplet birth occurred in 1959 in San Antonio, but those infants died within 24 hours.  
• In Pensacola, Florida, Sharon and Korey Rademacher secretly carried twin girls, Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith, revealing the surprise only after the March 11 delivery; their reaction video has surpassed 700,000 YouTube views."
11779,"• In response to a June 2014 federal court ruling that the prior system violated due-process rights, the U.S. government has revised its no-fly-list procedures.  
• U.S. citizens and permanent residents who seek redress will now be:  
  – Explicitly told whether they are on the list,  
  – Given an unclassified explanation of the specific listing criterion (as national-security limits allow),  
  – Allowed to submit written materials disputing their status, and  
  – Provided a final written decision from TSA.  
• The American Civil Liberties Union—whose suit on behalf of 13 listed Americans prompted the ruling—argues the new process still withholds sufficient notice, evidence, and a live hearing, and it plans to challenge the policy again.  
• The no-fly list, managed by the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, bars listed individuals from commercial flights; its exact size is classified, though a 2012 figure cited about 21,000 names, roughly 500 of them American."
11791,"Texas veterinarian Dr. Kristen Lindsey posted a Facebook photo showing herself holding a cat she had killed with an arrow, calling it her “first bow kill” and joking that a feral tomcat is only good “with an arrow through its head.” Public outrage quickly followed: callers flooded her workplace, its website crashed, and complaints poured into local authorities. The Washington County Animal Clinic fired Lindsey and distanced itself, while the Austin County sheriff’s office opened an animal-cruelty investigation; cat-advocacy group Alley Cat Allies offered a $7,500 reward for evidence leading to charges. Although some clients defended her, Lindsey deleted the post, shut down her Facebook page, and could still face legal consequences."
11795,"Video from CNN affiliate WMAR shows a woman in yellow jeans-jacket outfit spotting her masked son among Baltimore rioters, where she had seen him on TV throwing rocks at police. She drags him from the crowd, repeatedly slapping him and yelling “Get the f--- over here!” until he removes his mask. The clip went viral, and Police Commissioner Anthony Batts publicly thanked her, saying he wished more parents would intervene with their children."
11808,"A CNN team traveling 30 km east of Kathmandu to the village of Ravi Opi finds earthquake damage severe and aid scarce. The main highway is scarred by half-meter fissures, turning a short drive into a two-hour trip. Village officials say about 90 % of homes are uninhabitable, and residents refuse to enter the few still standing because of continuing aftershocks. 

Personal stories illustrate the loss: 62-year-old Maili Tamang, injured when her two-story house collapsed, now sits beside its ruins; farmer Mahesh Koiraba, 31, dug through debris to reach his home, only to find his two-year-old daughter Prati dead. With rain falling, four displaced families shelter under a flimsy structure, saying no government or outside help has reached them. 

Scattered landslides, continued tremors and damaged roads hamper relief, and more remote districts—reachable only on foot—may be suffering even worse, with the true extent of casualties and destruction still unknown."
11817,"On “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” Jeremy Renner appeared in character as Marvel’s Hawkeye and performed a parody of Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud.” Singing at the piano, he humorously claimed additional “powers,” such as owning many scarves and berets, playing trombone, and opening pickle jars. The segment highlighted Hawkeye’s lesser-known talents beyond archery and noted Renner’s film credentials, including both Avengers movies, The Hurt Locker, American Hustle, and roles in the Bourne and Mission: Impossible franchises."
11821,"Director Bryan Singer announced on Instagram that Olivia Munn will portray the telepathic mutant Psylocke (Betsy Braddock) in 2016’s “X-Men: Apocalypse,” the follow-up to “X-Men: Days of Future Past.” The film, now in production and slated for a May 27, 2016 release, already features James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence, and recently added fan-favorite Jubilee. Psylocke, created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe, has been a longstanding X-Men comic character since joining the team in 1987. Munn is represented by Creative Artists Agency and Atlas Artists."
11826,"Stephen Hawking has teamed up with Monty Python to release a new version of the comedy troupe’s “Galaxy Song” from their 1983 film “The Meaning of Life.” Issued as a 7-inch single for Record Store Day, the release is accompanied by a video in which Brian Cox critiques the song’s science until Hawking appears, knocks him over with his wheelchair, and performs the tune in his computerized voice before soaring into space. The sketch comes from footage used in Monty Python’s live shows and highlights lyrics that humorously outline cosmic facts. Written by Eric Idle and John Du Prez, the track is downloadable, adding to Hawking’s past musical cameo on Pink Floyd’s “Talkin’ Hawkin’.”"
11838,"The author recalls the 1980 Miami riot that erupted when four officers were acquitted in the fatal beating of Arthur McDuffie, noting it mirrors today’s Baltimore unrest after Freddie Gray’s death. She lists earlier flashpoints—Harlem 1964, Watts 1965, Newark and Detroit 1967, nationwide riots after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, and Los Angeles 1992—showing that U.S. “race riots” are typically triggered by perceived unjust police action.  

Raised by parents committed to non-violent civil-rights tactics, she contrasts past student sit-ins with current rock-throwing youths and moderates a panel titled “Riot — The Voice of the Unheard?” (linked to the play “Detroit ’67” and Kenny Leon’s True Colors Theatre Company) to ask whether riots are senseless violence or purposeful uprisings by people who feel hopeless and dehumanized.  

Historical commissions suggest riots can spur reform: the Kerner Commission (1968) blamed racism for poverty, police brutality, inferior schools and housing; the Christopher Commission (1992) cited profiling, excessive force, and lack of jobs and education—findings that led to government initiatives. A Watts rioter once told King, “We won because we made the whole world pay attention,” inspiring King’s line that “a riot is the language of the unheard.”  

In Baltimore, some teens misread the film “The Purge,” expecting to be “absolved,” but Rev. Jamal Bryant opened his church to teach non-violence. Peaceful protests in Ferguson after Michael Brown’s death produced a Justice Department report detailing systemic discrimination and recommending change. Baltimore’s violence has subsided, yet sustained, non-violent activism continues to carry the greatest power for reform."
11839,"Israel’s military says it carried out airstrikes Sunday night in the occupied Golan Heights after four militants crossed from Syria and tried to plant a bomb on the Israeli border. The strikes, which Israel reports thwarted the attack, killed three of the men, though their affiliation is unknown. The Golan Heights—seized from Syria in 1967, later annexed by Israel, and internationally considered occupied—has about 41,000 Jewish, Druze, and Alawite residents."
11840,"A Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad question, posted to Facebook by local TV host Kenneth Kong, has gone viral. The puzzle, dubbed “Cheryl’s birthday,” asks solvers to deduce her birthday from a list of ten possible dates (May 15, 16, 19; June 17, 18; July 14, 16; August 14, 15, 17) using a brief conversation between her friends Albert and Bernard. The brain-teaser—likened to the “What color is the dress” online frenzy—has attracted widespread attention; Georgia Tech mathematician Matt Baker, as well as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and many internet users, have posted solutions explaining how nine of the ten dates can be ruled out."
11858,"• Since mid-December, a “severe” HIV outbreak tied to injection of the opioid Opana has struck rural Scott and neighboring Jackson counties in Indiana.  
• By Friday, 142 people had tested positive (136 confirmed, 6 preliminary) in communities with only a few thousand residents.  
• Limited local health capacity (one non-HIV infectious-disease doctor) prompted Indiana to declare a public-health emergency, bring in CDC support, open a once-a-week volunteer clinic (33 patients so far), and send educators door-to-door.  
• Governor Mike Pence authorized, then extended, a 30-day needle-exchange program; such exchanges are proven to curb infections.  
• Officials blame rapid spread on frequent (4–10 times daily) large-gauge needle injections of Opana, widespread needle sharing within multigenerational households, and low awareness among younger users who did not experience the 1980s-90s HIV crisis.  
• Health leaders warn that rising IV drug abuse is also fueling a 150 % jump in hepatitis C (2010-2013) and could trigger similar outbreaks elsewhere unless vigilance, education, and harm-reduction measures continue."
11860,"Joni Mitchell was found unconscious at home a month ago and is still hospitalized at UCLA Medical Center. On April 28 her friend of 44 years, Leslie Morris, filed a court petition to become Mitchell’s conservator, stating Mitchell is unconscious and unable to care for herself. The same day, Mitchell’s website— in a statement approved by Morris—said she is alert, not in a coma, and expected to recover fully; publicist Alisse Kingsley affirmed the website’s version. A doctor’s declaration says Mitchell will probably be unable to attend court hearings for four to six months. Fans continue to post tributes at WeLoveYouJoni.com."
11870,"A new book, “Clinton Cash,” due May 5, is expected to intensify scrutiny of possible conflicts of interest stemming from large foreign and corporate donations to Clinton-run charities. Reported examples include money from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Canada’s foreign-affairs department (which backs the Keystone XL pipeline), as well as banks under government investigation that sponsored Clinton Global Initiative events. While such gifts raise ethical questions—especially whether they swayed State Department actions—no direct evidence (“smoking gun”) of quid-pro-quo has emerged, and CNN noted the Clintons apparently had no knowledge of banks’ ongoing probes.

Beyond potential influence-peddling, the foundations face criticism for poor management: large deficits, unchecked expansion, internal staff disputes, and an incident in which con man Raffaello Follieri pledged but never delivered $50 million. Still, these issues are familiar and may not strongly affect voters focused on jobs, schools and taxes. A Rasmussen poll found 57 % of likely 2016 voters expect Hillary Clinton to win, and Clinton herself dismissed the forthcoming revelations as “distractions,” suggesting her campaign will emphasize direct engagement with ordinary Americans rather than foundation controversies."
11875,"Andrew Lesnie, the Sydney-born, Oscar-winning cinematographer best known for shooting Peter Jackson’s six Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies, died of a heart attack on Monday at age 59. His long collaboration with Jackson also included King Kong (2005) and The Lovely Bones (2009); he earned his Academy Award for The Fellowship of the Ring (2001). Lesnie’s other credits span Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), I Am Legend (2007), The Last Airbender (2010), Healing (2014) and, most recently, Russell Crowe’s directorial debut The Water Diviner, released Friday in the U.S. Crowe called him “the master of the light.” Inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002, Lesnie studied at TAFE and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, began as a camera assistant at the ABC, and honed his craft on shorts, music videos, documentaries, commercials and the children’s show Wonder World."
11877,"• From 2010-2014 ambushes were the top cause of on-duty police murders, yet Google’s Waze app still lets users tag and share officers’ real-time locations.

• Waze (bought by Google in 2013 for about $1.1 billion) crowdsources traffic data; its “traffic cop” icon lets any of the app’s 50 million users mark an officer as “visible” or “invisible.”

• NYPD killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley used this feature in December 2014, posting screen shots while tracking police before shooting Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.

• Law-enforcement leaders say the function helps speeders, drunk drivers, domestic-violence offenders, gangs and terrorists evade or target police, undermining public safety (e.g., 10,076 U.S. drunk-driving deaths in 2013; 9,944 speed-related deaths in 2011).

• Despite its public image of social responsibility and claims that Waze serves the “common good,” Google refuses to meet with the National Sheriffs’ Association about disabling or modifying the feature.

• Police representatives argue Google should cooperate so motorists can get traffic help without endangering officers."
11888,"Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe created the series “Toy Soldiers” to challenge viewers’ desensitization to war imagery. Over five weeks in Western Sahara—a disputed region where the Polisario Front has fought Morocco since the mid-1970s—he photographed real Polisario soldiers posed like green plastic toy figures on historic battle sites. Thorpe, a landscape photographer, worked with 50–60 troops at a time (with military clearance and UN movement limits), using oil-drum platforms and shooting long days in the desert. He aims to prompt fresh emotional, physical and political responses to conflict and to question how war images will be consumed amid shrinking attention spans. The work is collected in a forthcoming book, also titled “Toy Soldiers.”"

• Authorities identified the suspect as 20-year-old former student and onetime print-shop employee Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, calling him “armed and dangerous.”  
• Officials say the shooting was an isolated incident, not random.  
• The attack occurred on the third floor of a campus building (not in the library).  
• A mistaken tear-gas deployment hit someone in a restroom who was not the suspect.

11911,"• After declaring an end to its month-long air campaign (Operation Decisive Storm) and announcing a new “political-process” phase called Operation Renewal of Hope, the Saudi-led coalition resumed airstrikes Wednesday, hitting a weapons depot in Taiz province following a rebel attack on a Yemeni army brigade.  
• In response, Houthi rebels said they are ready to restart U.N.-sponsored peace talks, but only once all attacks stop.  
• The Houthis freed Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi, whom they had held since March 26.  
• Saudi officials claim air operations have met their military goals, say the Houthis have accepted almost all U.N. Security Council demands, and insist ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh will leave Yemen permanently.  
• The coalition’s next objectives include civilian protection, humanitarian aid, counter-terrorism, maritime security, and continued border defense, with force to be used if necessary.  
• President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, still abroad, thanked the coalition, urged Houthi withdrawal, and promised to restructure Yemen’s military before returning home.  
• Separately, two U.S. drone strikes in Mukalla on Wednesday (and another on Monday) killed a total of twelve suspected al Qaeda militants; the U.S. is also flying reconnaissance missions and repositioning ships to safeguard navigation near Yemen."
11922,"ISIS is mounting a major assault on Ramadi, the capital of Iraq’s Anbar province, 70 miles west of Baghdad. Deputy provincial council chief Falih Essawi, speaking from the front lines, says government defenses are “collapsing rapidly,” has begged Baghdad and the U.S-led coalition for reinforcements and air support, and warns the city could fall within hours. 

Key battlefield details  
• ISIS advanced Wednesday in Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem, parts of Soufia, and then into central Ramadi; it already controls areas north and south of the city, leaving only western approaches in government hands.  
• At least 10 Iraqi security personnel were killed and 100-plus wounded the same day.  

Humanitarian impact  
• Roughly 150,000 residents fled Wednesday, clogging escape routes; families describe Iraqi troops abandoning positions and ISIS occupying their homes.  

Coalition response  
• The U.S. says Ramadi remains “contested,” not imminently falling; seven coalition airstrikes have hit nearby since Monday. Essawi’s appeal follows Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s request for more U.S. help during his Washington visit."
11932,"Equal Pay Day (April 14) marks how long into 2015 the average woman would have to work to match a man’s 2014 earnings, reflecting a 23 % gender wage gap—women average 77 cents to a man’s dollar, with larger gaps for women of color. Over a 40-year career the shortfall costs a woman about $431,000; closing it could lift half of working single mothers out of poverty and boost economic growth.

The article urges presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to dramatize this issue: pledge, if elected, to accept 77 % of the $400,000 presidential salary (about $308,000) and forgo a raise until pay equity is achieved. Such a “political stunt” would align with her populist campaign message, counter perceptions of elitism, and symbolically highlight nationwide pay inequity. Though theatrical, the author argues that modern politics relies on such gestures to spotlight important problems and galvanize change for America’s 158 million women."
11945,"The passage argues that ISIS and Boko Haram use systematic abuse of women as a central, deliberate element of their nation-building strategy. Unlike earlier jihadists such as al-Qaeda, which saw a future caliphate as distant, these groups are actively constructing one now and need women to populate and run it. Consequently they: 
• kidnap thousands (e.g., 2,000 Nigerians, 276 Chibok students; Yazidi women from Sinjar),  
• run “slave warehouses,” conduct organized rape, forced marriage and conversion (confirmed by Human Rights Watch and doctors),  
• justify enslavement with selective Islamic references, and  
• impose crushing restrictions on all women under their rule, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.  

Rape still serves as a weapon of war, but here the captives are kept, enslaved and integrated into everyday life to cement the envisioned Sharia-based society, leaving many victims believing life is no longer worth living."
11948,"SpaceX postponed Monday’s Falcon 9/Dragon cargo launch to the ISS because of weather; the next attempt is set for Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral. After liftoff, SpaceX will try—again, with roughly 50% expected success—to land the Falcon 9’s first stage upright on an autonomous drone-ship in the Atlantic to advance cost-saving rocket reuse (a January attempt exploded on impact). Dragon will carry 4,300 lb of supplies, including research gear and an espresso maker, reach the ISS in about two days, remain for five weeks while astronauts unload and reload it with 3,000 lb of return cargo, then splash down in the Pacific. This is SpaceX’s sixth ISS resupply mission."
11979,"After weeks of graphic testimony, the jury in the Boston Marathon bombing trial deliberated more than seven hours without reaching a verdict and will reconvene after submitting two questions. Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, faces 30 federal counts—17 punishable by death or life imprisonment—for the April 15, 2013 attacks that killed three spectators (8-year-old Martin Richard, graduate student Lingzi Lu, and Krystle Campbell) and later MIT officer Sean Collier, and that maimed scores of others. Prosecutors presented 92 witnesses and vivid evidence—videos, photos, victims’ accounts, a handwritten “manifesto,” and items linking the brothers to bomb materials—arguing Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan acted as equal “soldiers” seeking to terrorize America. The defense, which called four witnesses, admits Tsarnaev’s involvement but contends he was a 19-year-old under Tamerlan’s dominant influence. If Tsarnaev is convicted on any capital count, a separate penalty phase will follow to weigh aggravating versus mitigating factors."
12008,"The author interviews Kent State journalism students and finds many millennials indifferent or cautious about marriage. They prioritize careers, travel and personal happiness; Candace Monacelli values using her degree, Jackie Demate would rather spend wedding money on Europe, and Emily Crille cites heavy student-debt as a barrier. Raised amid high divorce rates—42 million Americans have married more than once versus 14 million in 1960—they see little urgency to wed. A Pew survey echoes this: 50 % of Americans, including 66 % of 18- to 29-year-olds, say society is fine when people focus on goals other than marriage and children.  

Economists warn that marriage often aligns with greater economic well-being, though causality is debated; an AEI study notes dual incomes help, yet financial security also makes people more “marriageable.” Abroad, Scandinavia illustrates a post-marriage model: over 80 % of Norwegian first children are born to unmarried couples, and Swedes cite cost, lack of legal advantage and secular attitudes for staying single.  

The students—and Swedish interviewees—insist marriage should happen only for love, not pressure or convention. The author, once skeptical but happily married at 38, wonders whether a “marriage apocalypse” would harm society, leaving the question open to readers."
12060,"Iraqi troops, supported by roughly 20,000 Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen and recent U.S.-led airstrikes, have wrested control of Tikrit from ISIS after multiple earlier failures. Entering the city, the forces found scores of IEDs, booby-trapped vehicles and buildings, and were still eliminating small pockets of resistance. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited to declare victory, while officials warned that militia reprisals against Tikrit’s largely Sunni population—retaliation for ISIS’ 2014 massacre of more than 1,500 Shiite air-force cadets—could inflame sectarian tensions. The win, achieved partly through surprise and coalition aid, follows nine months of ISIS brutality in the city and is seen as a springboard for an upcoming offensive to retake Mosul."
12068,"The International Committee of the Red Cross urged an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen, warning that scores of recently wounded civilians—especially in Aden—will die without rapid delivery of food, water, medical supplies and personnel. The appeal coincided with a U.N. Security Council session where Russia’s draft resolution to halt the Saudi-led coalition’s airstrikes produced no decision; diplomats said it omitted demands for Houthi rebels to cease fighting or enter political talks.  

Meanwhile, Saudi warplanes carried out their heaviest strikes yet in Sanaa, targeting two military bases, and a Saudi source said special forces are aiding pro-Hadi fighters as Houthis retreat from parts of Aden. The conflict began after Houthi Shiite rebels ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi in January; Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia in late March, prompting regional Sunni states to intervene by air.  

U.N. figures for the past two weeks list at least 519 dead and 1,700 wounded, with tens of thousands fleeing abroad; Aden alone saw 58 killed and 200 injured in the last two days. In eastern Yemen, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula controls territory and freed senior leader Khaled Batarfi and 270 others from jail. Separately, France evacuated 44 people from the port of Balhaf."
12073,"Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was recorded berating an Uber driver after the driver signaled for him to use a blinker while parking. The viral video shows Cherry cursing, mocking the driver’s accent, and threatening arrest, claiming the driver committed “three traffic and law violations.” 

Repercussions and responses:  
• Cherry has been placed on modified assignment; he could face suspension, reassignment, or loss of his top-secret clearance, and the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating.  
• Police Commissioner William Bratton called the conduct “unacceptable,” apologized to the driver and passengers, and noted the officer was on duty.  
• Mayor Bill de Blasio said there is no place for discriminatory language by public servants.  
• Cherry publicly apologized to the driver and to Bratton, admitting anger in the moment.  
• Detectives’ Endowment Association president Michael Palladino defended Cherry’s overall record while acknowledging the seriousness of the incident.  
• Uber is supporting the driver, and the Civilian Complaint Review Board is reviewing the case.

Outcome pending the investigations."
13806,"On the October 5 Big Brother 25 episode, outgoing Head of Household Cameron Hardin kept his initial nominees—Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes—on the block after also winning the Power of Veto. The eviction vote was unanimous (7–0), sending Mecole Hayes out as the season’s first jury member; on her exit she urged the house to target Cory Wurtenberger and America Lopez.  

Immediately after, a photo-memory True/False HOH competition ended in a tie between Bowie Jane and Felicia; Bowie Jane won the tiebreaker (estimating Jared Fields’ “zombie” minutes) and became Week 10’s new HOH—her first competition victory. Bowie will hold nominations on October 6.

13816,"Xanax (alprazolam) is a benzodiazepine that quickly eases acute anxiety by boosting the calming neurotransmitter GABA, making it useful for short-term or emergency relief. However, effectiveness over time is limited: the body can develop tolerance, prompting higher doses and risking dependence and withdrawal. Because of these drawbacks, chronic anxiety is generally better managed with therapy, lifestyle changes, or other medications, with any prolonged Xanax use requiring strict medical oversight. Overall, Xanax is a helpful short-term tool, but long-term anxiety care should be holistic and professionally guided."
13823,"The Pentagon is sending 900 U.S. troops to the Middle East after multiple recent drone and rocket attacks on American and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria, which caused 21 minor injuries. Among them are soldiers from Texas’ Fort Cavazos and Fort Bliss: most Fort Bliss personnel will operate a THAAD missile-defense battery (about 100 soldiers per battery), while additional troops from both bases will form air-defense headquarters elements. The rest of the 900 come from Patriot batteries at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Patriot and Avenger batteries at Fort Liberty, North Carolina. Defense officials stress these forces are not deploying to Israel but are intended to enhance regional deterrence and protect U.S. troops."

13840,"New York Republican Anthony D’Esposito, joined by GOP colleagues Nick LaLota, Marc Molinaro, and Mike Lawler, has filed a privileged motion to expel fellow Republican Rep. George Santos after 23 new federal charges—including unauthorized credit-card use and identity theft—were brought against him; Santos was already accused of fabricating much of his résumé. The House must vote on the motion this week, but GOP leaders, guarding a narrow 221-212 majority, could move to table it or send it to committee. Because expulsion needs 290 votes, passage would require 78 Republicans to join united Democrats—an outcome viewed as unlikely. Santos says he will not resign, so the controversy is expected to persist regardless of the vote’s result."
13842,"Jeff Probst used Survivor 45 Episode 2 to unveil a clearer sit-out policy: a player who skips one challenge must compete in the next—no exceptions or Tribal-Council “resets.” The change replaces the previous rule that only barred consecutive sit-outs within a single reward/immunity cycle, a loophole that let Claire Rafson skip three straight immunity challenges in Survivor 44 and sparked fan backlash. The update addresses confusion heightened by the 26-day season (fewer challenges) and should be easier for viewers to track. Survivor 45 airs Wednesdays on CBS (90-minute episodes, also on Paramount+); the On Fire podcast continues to discuss game developments, while recent contestants Hannah Rose and Brandon Donlon have spoken publicly about their exits and experiences."

13848,"• After a high-profile loss to Philadelphia, Miami’s attention turns to trade-deadline help.  
• While injured starters (Howard, Ramsey, Williams, Armstead, Achane) will return soon, the team still has clear needs—especially better pass-rush production from the defensive line.  
• Reporter Josina Anderson says multiple teams are ready to pursue Commanders edge rushers Chase Young or Montez Sweat; Miami is urged to explore Young despite the odds.  
• Current end Emmanuel Ogbah has only 2.5 sacks this year, and the line overall (including Christian Wilkins) has underperformed. Young, five years younger than Ogbah and already with 5 sacks in 2023, would represent a major upgrade.  
• Any trade for Young would require a prompt long-term extension, but Miami has shown willingness to pay stars before (e.g., its pursuit of Jonathan Taylor).  
• Pairing Young with Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelan Phillips, and Bradley Chubb could revive the Dolphins’ pass rush and strengthen the defense for a playoff run."

• The Biden administration has added Venezuelans who entered the country by July 31 to those eligible for Temporary Protected Status, potentially accelerating work-permit access for many migrants in New York City.  
• USCIS Director Ur Jaddou visited New York City’s migrant reception sites, work-authorization support center, and a Red Cross location to review coordination efforts.  
• To speed up work-permit approvals, USCIS is holding information sessions in libraries, sending email/SMS eligibility alerts, and deploying mobile biometric (fingerprinting) services; the agency aims to average a 30-day turnaround for applications.

• The same Pentagon assessment warns of broader Chinese military growth: a projected rise from 500 to nearly 1,000 nuclear warheads and construction of silo fields for 300+ ICBMs, plus possible conventionally armed intercontinental missiles.

• China’s navy, already the world’s largest at about 370 vessels, is expected to expand to roughly 435 by 2030; combined with aggressive exercises and rhetoric toward Taiwan, these developments heighten U.S. concern."

13971,"Melissa Claire Egan, who plays Chelsea on The Young and the Restless, has finished maternity leave after giving birth to her second son in July and is back on set. She confirmed via Twitter that she has already filmed her first episode, placing Chelsea’s on-screen return roughly six to eight weeks later—likely mid-to-late November, though it could be sooner if filming began earlier. Chelsea left town in the story to stay with her mother for Connor’s sake; her comeback will intersect with current plots involving Billy, Adam, her new job at Marchetti with Summer, and potential shifts in her relationship with Billy. The Young and the Restless airs weekdays on CBS."
13972,"During the week of October 23 on The Bold and the Beautiful, Eric Forrester insists on staging a high-stakes couture showdown against his son Ridge as his “final hurrah,” even though he is secretly gravely ill. He is coughing up blood, and Dr. Colin Colby informs him he is dying and must stop working. Eric dismisses the warning despite wife Donna Logan’s fears, letting pride drive him forward.

13979,"The Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix returns the series to the city for the first time in 40 years and will be the 1100th Formula One World Championship round. Run at night on 18 November 2023, the temporary 3.8-mile street circuit includes a two-kilometer stretch along the Las Vegas Strip, 3 straights, 3 DRS zones, and—after more than thirty design iterations—a high-speed, counter-clockwise layout of 14–17 turns. Teams will adopt low-downforce Monza-Spa aerodynamic setups to suit the circuit’s long, fast sections, while the nighttime schedule both mitigates heat and showcases the city’s lights."
13495,"Luis Alfredo Jacobo, a Bakersfield, California drug kingpin, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour to four concurrent life terms—one for directing a continuing criminal enterprise and three for methamphetamine conspiracies—plus four years for 21 counts of unlawful use of a communication facility.  

From 2016-2021, Jacobo led more than a dozen associates in three linked conspiracies that moved Mexican-sourced meth from California to Oklahoma and Missouri, shipping loads as large as 200 pounds and returning cash—sometimes $100,000 at a time—to California.  

Key evidence included seized communications, financial records, a 2020 Grove, Oklahoma storage unit holding 231 pounds of meth and $465,000, and the arrest of codefendant Tony Garcia with 30 pounds of meth and a loaded handgun, whose texts tied him to Jacobo.  

The case stemmed from OCDETF Operation “Pullin Chains,” a multi-agency effort led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and DEA to dismantle high-level drug networks."

13503,"A weak coronal mass ejection struck Earth overnight on October 20–21, 2023, unexpectedly generating vivid Northern Lights across the Midwest and Northern Plains—reports came from Minnesota, Michigan, southern Wisconsin, North Dakota, and even Omaha, Nebraska. Because the CME’s solar wind was slow and lacked the usual data spike, most aurora watchers missed its arrival; only a satellite data gap, a slight wind increase, and a gradual drop to negative Bz signaled the event, cues noticed by forecaster Charlie Bourdo. Limitless Media highlights Bourdo’s new “how-to” video on aurora forecasting and urges audiences to follow its social platforms for updates."
13522,"Savannah Chrisley has entered a new relationship with former Auburn football player Robert Shiver—the first serious romance she has discussed publicly since her on-off engagement to Nic Kerdiles. Over the weekend, Savannah and Robert double-dated at a Zach Bryan concert with her younger brother, Grayson Chrisley, and Grayson’s girlfriend, all wearing coordinated shirts. Savannah currently holds guardianship of Grayson and their sister/niece Chloe after parents Todd and Julie Chrisley began serving federal prison sentences last November. Speaking while promoting FOX’s “Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test,” Savannah praised Robert, saying she wants to protect the relationship, appreciates what they provide each other, and values that he understands her family responsibilities because he has children of his own. A future together would require Robert’s divorce to be finalized."

13554,"Cristina Michelle Husbands, 48, of Dallas, admitted to taking part in a multi-state bank-fraud conspiracy that stole hundreds of thousands of dollars—including $108,000 from Regions Bank accounts in Mississippi—between November 2021 and April 2022. Recruited while homeless and struggling with addiction, she used forged IDs to withdraw funds in Mississippi, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas. Already jailed in Texas on related charges, she was sentenced in Mississippi to 64 months in federal prison, five years of supervised release, and $481,140 in restitution; additional cases remain pending elsewhere."
13558,"Texas first-term Representative Eddie Morales, whose district includes parts of El Paso, Del Rio, and Eagle Pass, told Fox 4’s Steven Dial that President Biden has not provided enough support to border states amid continued high migrant crossings (about 100,000 shy of last year’s record 2,378,944 encounters). Morales proposed that each migrant be charged a $2,000 “initial processing fee.” The payment would come with a non-voting RFID-equipped ID card usable as a credit card. Using the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector’s average of 1,600 daily crossings, he estimated the fee could raise roughly $3.2 million per day, or over $1.2 billion annually. He framed the idea as a “win-win” that would also formalize temporary labor agreements between Texas and Mexican governors."

15619,"Authorities say two linked shootings struck the Washington area Thursday night. The violence started outside the U.S. Census Bureau in Suitland, Maryland, where a security guard was critically wounded after approaching a vehicle involved in an apparent domestic-kidnapping incident. The suspect fled, firing at several locations during a police pursuit that ended with a crash and shootout on H Street in Washington. Both the suspect and a police officer were injured but conscious; the kidnapping victim was later found safe. Identities of the suspect, guard and officer have not been released."
15647,"California’s measles outbreak that started in December has officially ended, according to the state’s Department of Public Health. After 42 days (two incubation periods) without a new B3–strain case, officials confirmed the outbreak contained. In total, 131 Californians contracted the B3 strain and five others had a different genotype; vaccination status was known for 81 of the 131, and 70% of those 81 were unvaccinated. The outbreak began with visitors to two Disney theme parks, including 42 cases between December 17-20. Intensive contact tracing, targeted vaccinations, and heightened provider awareness helped stop further spread. Two April measles cases involved a genotype unrelated to the outbreak."
15748,"Jill (Duggar) Dillard, the first daughter from the reality show “19 Kids and Counting” to marry, has become the family’s first daughter to have a child. On Monday she delivered a 9-pound, 10-ounce son, Israel David, more than a week past his due date. Jill, a student midwife, had anticipated the delay. Her parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, shared a video of the new family on Facebook. Jill and husband Derick were married June 21. The eldest Duggar son, Josh, already has three children, and his wife Anna is expecting their fourth in July."
15777,"The author argues that warning signs of Germanwings Flight 9525 co-pilot Andreas Lubitz’s severe psychiatric problems should have been detected long before the crash. While most airline pilots can compartmentalize stress and can now legally fly while treated for ordinary depression, Lubitz’s illness was far more serious (he reportedly required injections). Yet no one in several screening layers flagged him:

• Glider flying, his first aviation passion, relies on close teamwork that usually exposes personality problems.  
• Lufthansa’s highly competitive selection process and its costly, 250-hour ab-initio MPL training in Goodyear, Arizona, place candidates under constant scrutiny; Lubitz even took an unusual leave during this phase and had admitted prior depression.  
• After returning to Germany for Airbus A320 training, colleagues who routinely share cramped cockpits still reported no concerns, despite pilots’ practiced ability to sense irregular behavior.

Lubitz had only about 600 total flight hours—far less than the 1,500 now required for U.S. co-pilots—and faced added pressures: Germanwings’ lower pay, heavier schedules, and recent labor strife may have limited medical-leave options. The author concludes that these combined stresses formed “an accident waiting to happen,” underscoring the need for investigations to prevent a repeat tragedy."
15782,"Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a 23-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Columbus, Ohio, was arraigned Friday and pleaded not guilty to federal counts of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI. According to the indictment:

• Mohamud became a citizen in February 2014, applied for a U.S. passport days later, and in April 2014 used a one-way ticket to Greece (with a layover in Istanbul) to covertly enter Syria.  
• In Syria he trained with al-Nusra Front in weapons, explosives, break-ins, and hand-to-hand combat, and was told by a cleric to return to the United States to carry out terrorism.  
• He allegedly planned to kill Americans—especially U.S. soldiers—hoping to attack a Texas military base or, as a fallback, a prison.  
• Mohamud expressed satisfaction that his brother Aden had died fighting for al-Nusra and said he expected to die soon as well.  

He was ordered held in custody; his attorney, Sam Shamansky, said Mohamud will receive a vigorous defense."
15784,"• Sheriff Stanley Glanz said two Tulsa deputies seen pinning Eric Harris’ head to the ground and replying “F*ck your breath” have been reassigned after receiving threats; they face no criminal charges so far.  
• Operations of the sheriff’s drug unit are suspended while the April 2 shooting is reviewed, though Glanz may wait until Reserve Deputy Robert Bates’ court case concludes before judging the deputies’ conduct.  
• Bates, 73, who shouted “Taser, Taser” but fired his handgun, is charged with second-degree manslaughter, free on $25,000 bond, claims the shooting was accidental, and has apologized.  
• Amid criticism of Bates’ age, training and friendship with Glanz, the sheriff denies any forged records or waivers, says Bates met qualification standards, and notes the FBI found no civil-rights violations.  
• Glanz apologized to Harris’ family, has brought in a Dallas police consultant for another policy review, while the family calls the incident evidence of deeper departmental problems and demands justice and reforms."
11350,"Carlos Colina, 32, of Massachusetts will be arraigned on April 14 for the murder of Jonathan Camilien, 26, whose dismembered remains were found April 9 in a duffel bag and a nearby apartment common area in Cambridge. Colina had already been arraigned for assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body, and his bail was revoked in a separate assault case involving a different victim. Authorities say Colina and Camilien knew each other; District Attorney Marian Ryan called the discovery “gruesome.”"
11354,"While heading to an interview on L Street NW in rainy Washington, CNN’s Brian Todd and Khalil Abdallah saw pedestrians guiding a mother duck and her ducklings across the busy road. One man loaned his umbrella to lead the frantic mother while others stopped traffic and retrieved a stray duckling. The group then escorted the birds to a safer grassy spot at 16th and L. Todd called the downtown duck scene extraordinary for D.C."
11365,"Since Saudi Arabia and eight allies began airstrikes on March 26, they have carried out about 1,200 raids and report killing over 500 Houthi rebels. Fighting near the Saudi-Yemeni border in Najran left three Saudi officers dead and two wounded after Houthi mortar fire. Civilian losses stand at 385 dead and 342 wounded according to Yemen’s Health Ministry, while the WHO—counting combatants as well—lists 648 killed and 2,191 injured. The coalition says its strikes are meant to stop Houthis advancing south, amid Yemen’s broader turmoil that began when the rebels ousted President Hadi in January; even before the current escalation, the UN said most of Yemen’s 25 million people already needed basic humanitarian aid."
11396,"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, head of the Diocese of Kansas City–St. Joseph, Missouri. Finn was convicted in 2012 of failing to report suspected child abuse after diocesan officials delayed telling police about child-pornography images found on priest Shawn Ratigan’s computer; he received two years’ probation and set up a $10,000 counseling fund while remaining in office. Critics, including Cardinal Sean O’Malley and scholars, questioned why the Vatican let him stay nearly three years post-conviction. The Pope has named Archbishop Joseph Naumann apostolic administrator until a new bishop is chosen. Advocates welcome the move but urge clearer, quicker accountability for bishops who mishandle abuse cases."
11416,"Tristan da Cunha—a South Atlantic UK territory of about 270 residents and reputedly the world’s most remote settlement—is launching an international design competition, run with the Royal Institute of British Architects, to secure its long-term viability before its 200th anniversary in 2016.  Entrants with expertise in renewable energy, modern housing and cost-effective agriculture must address severe logistical limits: materials reach the island only by sea (about 60 days a year) and cargo space is restricted.  

Current infrastructure consists mainly of small, poorly insulated concrete-and-rock bungalows, limited internet and renewable-power capacity, and 40-year-old public buildings.  Recent upgrades to water, electricity and wastewater systems are complete, but the community wants to cut fossil-fuel use, lower living costs and modernize government facilities.  

The island already supports a pub, shop, café, church, museum, school (≈30 pupils) and minimal medical staff; its economy relies on lobster exports plus stamps, coins, handicrafts and modest tourism.  Architects must submit concepts by mid-June 2015; twenty proposals will be shortlisted, then five, with a winner due in June 2016 pending UK/EU funding.  The brief’s core aim is “cost-effective and practical” energy-efficient design for homes and public structures."
11428,"Sunday’s “Inside Politics” highlighted four storylines:

• Obama’s upcoming Panama summit could feature the first U.S.–Cuban-leader meeting in decades; the White House is weighing whether a face-to-face with Raul Castro would spur progress or reward the regime too soon.

• Hillary Clinton is set to formalize her 2016 bid: she has leased Brooklyn headquarters, plans a biographical rollout stressing her childhood and early children’s-advocacy work, has built a much larger-than-expected, veteran staff, and will favor small, personal events.

• Sen. Robert Menendez’s corruption indictment includes an allegation that his staff sought money for a super PAC, potentially prompting wider FEC scrutiny of other lawmakers’ fundraising.

• The GOP field is quickly forming—Cruz, Paul and Rubio will be official by next week—and operatives are choosing sides; examples include Matt Maroney joining Chris Christie and pollster Tony Fabrizio signing on with Rand Paul after interest from multiple campaigns."
11430,"CNN has promoted Jake Tapper to anchor its Sunday political interview show “State of the Union,” starting in June. He will keep his roles as chief Washington correspondent and weekday host of “The Lead.” Tapper, praised for political expertise and past Sunday-show experience at ABC, replaces Candy Crowley, whose December departure led to months of rotating hosts. CNN CEO Jeff Zucker announced the move, citing Tapper’s reporting and interviewing strengths. The change comes amid broader Sunday-show anchor shifts at CBS and NBC, giving CNN a chance to attract new viewers. Tapper will be one of the few anchors handling both weekday and Sunday morning duties, a model previously used at CNN by Wolf Blitzer."

11800,"• Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old American aid worker from Rockville, Maryland, was abducted from his Lahore, Pakistan, home in 2011 by gunmen linked to al Qaeda.  
• Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri soon claimed responsibility and issued demands; the United States refused to negotiate.  
• For 3½ years Weinstein’s family campaigned for his release, citing his worsening health and urging a prisoner swap, but none occurred.  
• In January, a U.S. counterterrorism drone strike on an al Qaeda compound along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border unknowingly killed Weinstein and Italian hostage Giovanni Lo Porto; the deaths were disclosed Thursday.  
• President Obama called Weinstein a lifelong humanitarian who had worked as a Peace Corps volunteer, USAID contractor (2004-2011), and development expert who loved Pakistan and spoke Urdu.  
• Weinstein’s wife Elaine, while chiefly blaming the captors, condemned both the U.S. and Pakistani governments for inconsistent efforts and welcomed an announced U.S. investigation. She urged a more coordinated U.S. policy for aiding hostages.  
• Supporters and former colleagues described Weinstein as kind, service-oriented, and devoted to improving lives in poor regions; his family remains heartbroken and searching for full answers about his death."

Lee, named in the note, will remain in office until President Park Geun-hye—currently abroad and calling the resignation “regrettable”—formally accepts it; in the meantime he has ceded chairing Cabinet meetings to the deputy prime minister. Lee and seven other Park associates are under investigation by a special prosecutor, though Lee denies wrongdoing. Park has vowed to address corruption decisively upon her return to South Korea on April 27."
11871,"• Corinthian Colleges Inc. announced it is closing its last 28 campuses; once enrolling 70,000 students, it epitomizes “predator” for-profit colleges.  
• Such schools:  
  – Rely on aggressive recruiting, online classes and part-time faculty.  
  – Collect about 86 % of their revenue from federal student-loan dollars.  
  – Enroll only 13 % of U.S. college students but produce nearly half of all loan defaults.  
• The Education Department cut Corinthian’s federal-aid access in 2014; graduates have since launched a “debt strike,” prompting officials to consider loan forgiveness.  
• Outcomes are poor: average online for-profit graduates earn less than high-school dropouts, degrees cost roughly 60 % more than equivalents at public colleges, and default rates exceed those of subprime borrowers during the financial crisis.  
• Investigations reveal widespread misconduct: GAO’s 2011 probe, 36 state attorneys general in 2014, and a $10 million settlement by Career Education Corp. in 2013.  
• Industry influence remains strong—CEOs earn millions and employ many lobbyists—but enrollment is falling (e.g., University of Phoenix down to 213,000).  
• The author urges closing remaining for-profit colleges and forgiving debts of students not placed in jobs or transferred within three years, arguing continued federal funding is unaffordable amid $1 trillion in student-loan debt."
11884,"Kabul has grown five-fold in population yet feels diminished and uneasy as NATO’s era ends.  

• Former English-speaking staff once valued by NATO have been fired, blacklisted and are now homeless, fearing reprisals and unable to visit their families.  
• Areas previously crowded with foreign contractors—expensive “poppy palaces,” Chicken Street shops, restaurants—now stand largely deserted.  
• Idle machinery, abandoned bases and rows of unsellable supply trucks mark the collapse of vast wartime logistics; drivers are stranded with heavy debts while wealthy contractors have fled abroad.  
• Despite uncertainty, brightly lit wedding halls still thrive and the city’s constant lights—kept on by costly, seldom-used NATO diesel stations—raise doubts about how long they will shine once the final U.S. troops pull back to the embassy next year."
11885,"Consumer Reports analyzed 70 million trips on the five largest U.S. airlines to see how easy it is to book domestic award seats.  

• Availability  
  – Southwest led with 11.9 million award seats (11.5 % of its 103.1 million seats).  
  – Delta: 5.6 million (2nd).  
  – United: 5 million (3rd).  
  – American: 3.5 million (4th).  
  – JetBlue: 892 000 (4.5 % of 19.7 million; last place).  

• Why Southwest scores highest: every seat can be an award seat, no blackout dates, points don’t expire, and no fees for close-in booking or cancellations.  

• JetBlue lags partly because many customers fly it only once or twice a year, though its miles no longer expire.  

• About 10 % of all seats studied were award seats, yet mileage value varies: e.g., spending 12 500–30 000 miles on cheap Los Angeles–San Francisco flights is poor value; longer, pricier routes like New York–San Francisco or Chicago–Los Angeles offer better returns.  

• Customer satisfaction scores: Southwest 86, JetBlue 85, Delta 70, American 66, United 63.  

• Fees matter: Southwest charges none; other carriers add fees for bags, phone bookings, changes, etc."
11890,"James Holmes is accused of carrying out one of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings when, on July 20 2012, he entered an Aurora, Colorado cinema during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises,” wearing body-armor and a gas mask, and opened fire with multiple weapons, killing 12 people and wounding 70. Arrested outside the theater, Holmes had also rigged his apartment with explosives that were later disarmed. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming a psychotic episode; prosecutors are instead seeking the death penalty. Jury selection drew 9,000 prospects and produced 12 jurors and 12 alternates (19 women, 5 men), who must decide 165 counts of murder and attempted murder in a trial expected to last four to five months beginning Monday. Holmes, now 27, was a high-achieving California-raised neuroscience doctoral student in Aurora, funded by an NIH grant, but showed worsening mental health: he told a classmate in March 2012 he wanted to kill people, threatened a professor, and concerned his psychiatrist, Dr. Lynne Fenton, who considered him potentially dangerous. In the weeks before the attack he bought four guns and over 6,000 rounds of ammunition. His parents ask that his life be spared and that he receive lifelong treatment; victims’ families urge media to stop publicizing mass killers’ names and images."
11891,"Prosperity-gospel pastor Creflo Dollar has released a five-minute YouTube clip defending his widely criticized effort to obtain a $65 million Gulfstream G650 jet. Speaking at World Changers Church International, he said “the devil” is trying to discredit him, insisted he never asked congregants “for a dime,” yet acknowledged that in March he appealed online to “friends from around the world” for $300 each from 200,000 people to replace his aging 1984 Gulfstream G-1159A, which has had two accidents. The original fundraising video and page have been removed, though donations are still possible through the ministry’s gift page; the appeal targeted the church’s reported 3 million supporters. Dollar argued critics misunderstand his travel needs, noting the G650’s long-range, 18-passenger capacity. Prosperity-gospel theology promises health and wealth to those who tithe 10 percent. Attempts to reach his ministry for comment were unsuccessful."
