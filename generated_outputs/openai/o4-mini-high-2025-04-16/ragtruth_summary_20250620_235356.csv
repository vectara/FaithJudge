15599,"Blue Bell Creameries has temporarily closed its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant and warned consumers not to eat any Blue Bell products made there—particularly 3-ounce ice cream servings marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T—after listeria monocytogenes was found in a sample from that facility. The plant shutdown, the company says, is “out of an abundance of caution” while it investigates the contamination’s source. This is Blue Bell’s third such action following a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital that served its ice cream. The same strain of listeria was recovered from a hospital patient’s cup and from the factory in April 2014, though it did not exactly match samples from infected Kansas patients. In a separate Texas outbreak dating from 2010 to 2014, patient samples did match listeria in hospital-recovered cups. Investigations are ongoing to determine whether these illnesses are linked to Blue Bell products. Earlier in March, Blue Bell recalled other products from its Texas plant, later adding its 3-ounce cups. In Kansas, five hospitalized patients contracted listeriosis—four after consuming Blue Bell milkshakes—and three died. This marks the company’s first product recall in its 108-year history. The CDC advises discarding all recalled items and notes that listeriosis is a serious infection especially dangerous for the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and immunocompromised individuals."
15601,"An independent review by Columbia Journalism School faculty found that Rolling Stone’s article on an alleged UVA gang rape “deeply” failed at every level—reporting, editing, supervision, and fact-checking.  The magazine’s managing editor apologized to readers and to those harmed by the story, including members of Phi Kappa Psi and other UVA students and administrators.  

Under Virginia law (Jordan v. Kollman), a defamation claim requires publication of a false, defamatory statement with the requisite intent.  True statements and pure opinion are not actionable.  Individual fraternity members are “private persons,” so to sue they must show that Rolling Stone published false factual statements about them, that their reputations were harmed, and that the magazine knew the statements were false or acted negligently.  The Columbia report may help prove intent, but other hurdles remain.  

UVA itself cannot sue for defamation because government entities have no such cause of action.  A fraternity as a group generally cannot sue unless it qualifies under the “small‐group” exception—i.e., the defamatory statements target a limited class whose members can be individually identified.  Phi Kappa Psi might argue this point; Rolling Stone could counter that the fraternity’s membership is too large and fluid to show individualized injury.  Other fraternities not directly implicated would face even steeper obstacles.  Finally, any successful defamation suit must also demonstrate concrete financial harm, making such cases rare."
15604,"The author, who in 1967 became the first woman and first person of color elected to the Kentucky State Senate, criticizes Rand Paul’s presidential bid as disingenuous. Although his campaign claims to “expand the Republican Party” and reach minority voters, his record—questioning the Civil Rights Act, opposing stronger voting rights protections, seeking to abolish the Department of Education, limiting women’s choices, and denying DREAMers relief—shows no real commitment to minority issues. His outreach efforts have struck black audiences as condescending, and his “take our country back” rhetoric hearkens to an era before major civil rights advances. The author concludes that Paul’s outdated views and policies disqualify him from leading the nation, and that Americans deserve a leader who respects democratic progress rather than undermines it."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau, now 53, and her 31-year-old husband Vili Fualaau remain happily married ten years after her release from prison. In 1996, Letourneau—a married 34-year-old teacher and mother of four in Seattle—began an affair with her 13-year-old student, gave birth to his child, and served more than seven years behind bars on related charges. The couple wed in 2005 and have two teenage daughters. On Friday, ABC’s “20/20” airs an exclusive interview for their 10th anniversary: Letourneau talks about sustaining their age-gap marriage, plans to teach again, and lifting her sex-offender status, while Vili discusses his battles with alcoholism, depression, and feeling failed by the system as a minor."
15616,"Kanye West and paparazzo Daniel Ramos have quietly settled the 2013 LAX–airport lawsuit in which West assaulted Ramos and tried to grab his camera. Ramos had sued for general and punitive damages, arguing West interfered with his right to work; West had pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery, receiving two years’ probation, anger-management classes and community service. The case was due for trial this week, but was dismissed after the parties reached an agreement that includes a personal apology from West, captured in a photograph of the two men shaking hands. The original incident—filmed on July 19, 2013—showed Ramos urging West to talk, West refusing and accusing Ramos of trying to make him “pay…like $250,000,” then lunging at him for about 15 seconds. Lawyer Gloria Allred said the settlement “sent an important message: celebrities are not above the law.” Earlier, West also resolved a January 2014 assault claim at a Beverly Hills chiropractor’s office by settling civilly and avoiding criminal charges."
15617,"Blues legend B.B. King, 89, was briefly hospitalized for dehydration linked to his Type II diabetes but “is much better” and left the hospital to rest at home with his family, his daughter Claudette and publicist Angela Moore told the Los Angeles Times. King, who thanked fans for their concern, requires no further details on the hospital stay. Known as “Blues Boy” from his days as the Beale Street Blues Boy disc jockey, he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and has earned 30 Grammy nominations. Over the years he played Gibson guitars he nicknamed Lucille—a practice that led Gibson in the 1980s to issue a custom Lucille signature model. His best-known songs include “The Thrill Is Gone” (his first Grammy win in 1970), “There Must Be a Better World Somewhere” and “When Love Comes to Town” (with U2). Last year he also canceled the remainder of his tour after suffering dehydration and exhaustion following a Chicago performance. Reported by CNN’s Greg Botelho and Sonya Hamasaki."
15623,"Chris Copeland, a 31-year-old forward for the Indiana Pacers, was stabbed just before 4 a.m. Wednesday after leaving 1OAK, a Chelsea nightclub, with companion Katrine Saltara. Although initial reports placed the attack at the club’s door, 1OAK later clarified that it occurred several blocks away near the Fulton Houses project—beyond the venue’s surveillance—and that staff aided Copeland only after he staggered back toward the club, leaving a trail of blooded handprints. A 22-year-old Brooklyn man, who never entered 1OAK, was arrested at the scene when Copeland’s driver detained him; charges are pending. Copeland sustained knife wounds to his left elbow and abdomen and is in stable condition; Saltara and a second woman were also cut. Shortly afterward, two Atlanta Hawks players—Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha—were arrested nearby on obstruction and related charges after pushing through police securing the crime scene. Neither is accused of participating in the stabbing, and both plan to contest the charges. The NBA, the Hawks and the Pacers are investigating, and team officials have issued statements expressing concern and promising further updates."
15627,"Twenty years after her death, Tejano star Selena is set to return as a fully interactive digital “hologram” called Selena the One. Developed by Nevada-based Acrovirt LLC using its “Digitized Human Essence” technology, the figure will walk, talk, sing and dance autonomously. Selena’s sister, Suzette Quintanilla, stresses it isn’t meant to replace her but to introduce her to new fans and keep her legacy alive. The project will debut new songs, collaborate with current artists and aims for a 2018 tour. An Indiegogo campaign launching April 16 seeks $500,000 in funding. The announcement coincides with the April 17–18 Fiesta de la Flor in Corpus Christi, Texas."
15628,"Alaska Airlines Flight 448, bound from Seattle–Tacoma to Los Angeles, climbed for just 14 minutes Monday afternoon when the crew heard banging from the pressurized, temperature-controlled cargo hold. Air traffic control ordered an immediate return; ground crews and emergency vehicles met the jet on landing. Investigators found the noise was a Menzies Aviation ramp agent—charged with loading luggage—who’d accidentally fallen asleep inside. A federal air marshal rapped back to him and urged him to stay put until landing. The agent, who began his shift at 5 a.m. (set to end at 2:30 p.m.), was unhurt, passed a hospital drug test and was released. During pre-departure checks his team lead unsuccessfully tried to call him, and co-workers assumed he’d gone home. Alaska Airlines says it is looking into the incident; ramp staff carry security badges and undergo criminal background checks. Flight 448 later departed and reached Los Angeles Monday evening with its 170 passengers and six crew."
15634,"Emy Afalava, born in American Samoa and a decorated U.S. veteran, has lived under U.S. law his whole life yet is denied citizenship and the right to vote. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, “all persons born … in the United States … are citizens,” but the federal government treats American Samoa as an exception. Afalava and other American Samoans have sued in the D.C. Circuit to secure their birthright citizenship. Historically, the Supreme Court once denied citizenship to African-Americans in Dred Scott (later overturned by the 14th Amendment) and treated residents of newly acquired territories—like Puerto Rico in the 1904 Gonzalez case—as non-citizens, reflecting racial biases in the Insular Cases. Over the past century, inhabitants of every other U.S. territory have become citizens. American Samoans now remain the sole group born on U.S. soil still awaiting recognition as U.S. citizens."
15638,"Iman (25) and Siham (27) Hashi are Somali‐Canadian sisters who were born in Mogadishu, fled the 1991 civil war, and grew up as refugees in Canada. Now based in Los Angeles under the name Faarrow (“Faith” and “Arrow”), they’re recording their Afro-pop debut album with actor-producer Elijah Kelley. Drawing on influences from Michael Jackson and the Spice Girls to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, their sound blends pop, hip-hop and African percussion. They co-wrote and produced most tracks before signing with Warner Brothers, which has given them full creative control. Alongside music, they serve as UNHCR spokespeople, founded a nonprofit for refugee advocacy, perform benefit concerts, and run “Wish Creatively,” a social-enterprise jewelry line funding women’s projects in Somalia and Kenya. Their album is in its final mixing stage, with a lead single due soon."
15651,"Pope Francis, facing a high-stakes centenary Mass in Rome commemorating the 1915–1916 slaughter of Armenians, chose to call the killings “the first genocide of the 20th century” by quoting a 2001 document of Pope John Paul II. That move maintained the Vatican’s longstanding emphasis on continuity—John Paul used the term only in writing, and Benedict XVI had labeled the massacres a “great evil” without calling them genocide—while avoiding an explicit policy shift. At the same time, Francis sought to moderate Turkish anger (Turkey is a key partner against ISIS) but nonetheless provoked an official protest: Ankara recalled its ambassador to the Holy See, summoned the Vatican’s envoy, and condemned the pope’s language as “unacceptable.” The incident highlights Francis’s blend of prophetic bluntness and diplomatic caution—a style already evident in his brokering of U.S.-Cuba detente, his invitation to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and his outspoken interventions on issues from ISIS to freedom of speech. At a morning Mass the next day, he encouraged priests to speak truthfully and courageously, echoing the early apostles."

15661,"Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed a second remote-controlled, shape-shifting robot into the damaged Fukushima Daiichi reactor on April 15 after the first one stalled on April 10. The new probe, sent because workers still cannot safely enter, gathered radiation and temperature readings at all 11 planned points and found both lower than expected—signaling that cooling systems are holding—and captured images showing an unexplained green glow and yellow discoloration on a grating. TEPCO cut the first robot’s cable on April 12 after it became blocked by debris, though it had already surveyed 14 of its 18 target locations. Akira Ono, chief of the plant, called the mission “a great step forward” for obtaining data needed in the unprecedented decommissioning effort, which will cost about $50 billion and take years to complete."
15665,"The passage describes the victim-impact phase of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s trial, in which jurors, having found him guilty on all counts, must now decide between life and death. Prosecutors presented tearful testimony from survivors and families of the four people Tsarnaev killed—29-year-old Krystle Campbell, Chinese student Lingzi Lu, eight-year-old Martin Richard and MIT officer Sean Collier—emphasizing how each was beloved by family and died in agony without warning. Photographs showed happy, ordinary moments, contrasted with a defiant mug shot of Tsarnaev flipping the camera the day of his arraignment. Survivors gave harrowing accounts: high-school senior Gillian Reny described her leg shattering and blood everywhere; restaurant manager Celeste Corcoran detailed the blast, her ensuing double amputation and the chronic, burning phantom pain that makes daily life an “uphill battle.” The prosecutor argued these stories reveal both the physical brutality and emotional devastation Tsarnaev inflicted, underscoring his lack of remorse and the “very essence of terror” behind his crimes."
15667,"Billboard’s look back at the 50th Academy of Country Music Awards in Dallas highlights ten “best” moments and five “worst.”  Best moments included:  
 • A high-energy joint kickoff from Eric Church (“Pledge Allegiance to the Hag”) and Keith Urban (“Raise ’Em Up”)  
 • A Guinness World Record for the largest-ever live-TV awards audience  
 • Reba McEntire’s powerhouse vocals  
 • Taylor Swift singing along in the crowd  
 • Garth Brooks’ emotional “All-American Kid” salute to U.S. troops  
 • A poignant presentation of an award to Taylor Swift by her mother, Andrea Swift  
 • Christina Aguilera guesting with Rascal Flatts on “Riot”  
 • Miranda Lambert’s dynamic medley and award sweep  
 • Little Big Town’s stirring “Girl Crush” performance  
 • Jason Aldean’s strong, stadium-filling medley  

The five lowlights were:  
 • Tony Romo’s awkward on-stage bit with hosts Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan  
 • The show’s bloated three-and-a-half-hour length  
 • Rushed Milestone Awards for Reba McEntire, Kenny Chesney, George Strait and others  
 • Critical commentary on Steven Tyler’s facial hair  
 • Twitter backlash accusing Taylor Swift of abandoning country music  "
15670,"Polish Prince Jan Zylinski has taken to YouTube to denounce Nigel Farage’s anti-immigration rhetoric—especially his blaming of Eastern European migrants for Britain’s problems—and formally challenged the UKIP leader to a sword duel in Hyde Park. Brandishing his father’s World War II sword, Zylinski demanded either an 18th-century-style fight or, alternatively, a televised debate. Farage, campaigning ahead of the May 7 general election on a platform of leaving the EU to regain border control and cutting the £9 billion aid budget, politely declined, calling Polish emigration “a tragedy” for Poland. Zylinski also released a separate video listing Polish contributions to Britain—such as RAF pilots in the Battle of Britain, a strong work ethic and seamless integration—and urged Britons to stop discriminating against Poles and instead embrace them as loyal members of society."
15673,"A small Cessna 414 carrying seven people, including Illinois State University associate men’s basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch, crashed about two miles east of Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington while returning from the NCAA Final Four championship in Indianapolis. Neither the identities of the other passengers nor the crash’s cause were immediately known. In statements, ISU President Larry Dietz and Athletic Director Larry Lyons mourned two “well-respected and much-loved colleagues,” praising Leetch’s leadership in athletics communications and Ward’s recruiting talent and coaching career, which spanned playing at UAB, a stint in China, and assistant and associate head-coach roles at ISU. The university community expressed shock and profound sadness at the sudden loss."
15683,"The passage reports on the sentencing-phase testimony in the trial of 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted alongside his now-deceased brother for the Boston Marathon bombing. On the third day of victim impact statements, biomedical researcher Steve Woolfenden described being blown off his feet, sustaining a shattered tibia and severed Achilles tendon, and using tourniquets on himself and his bleeding 3-year-old son Leo until a bystander carried the boy to safety. Trauma surgeon Dr. David King, a former combat surgeon, likened the bombing injuries to those he treated in Iraq and Afghanistan and explained that 8-year-old Martin Richard, standing only 3½ feet from one bomb, bled to death from massive internal wounds. Marathon spectator Heather Abbott recounted a foot injury so severe she elected below-knee amputation after failed salvage attempts. Another survivor, Marc Fucarile, described severe burns and leg amputation, chronic pain and a daily regimen of over 70 pills. The prosecution has rested; defense attorneys led by Judy Clarke will begin presenting mitigation witnesses."
15690,"Sofia Vergara is resisting a lawsuit brought by her ex-fiancé, Nick Loeb, who seeks to prevent her from destroying two female embryos they created via IVF in November 2013 and instead have them implanted in a surrogate. Filed anonymously as Joe Doe vs. Jane Doe in Los Angeles, the suit also names the Art Reproductive Center, where the embryos are stored. According to court papers, the couple, engaged at the time, intended to have children together and already attempted two unsuccessful surrogate implantations. Loeb says life begins at fertilization and has offered to waive any financial or parental claims by Vergara, whom he refers to only as his “ex.” Vergara previously explained she froze eggs to plan ahead—she already has a son, while Loeb wanted a biological child. Legal experts note that, absent a prior agreement on embryo disposition, California courts typically decide ownership and whether embryos are treated as property or potential life. The case highlights emerging ethical and legal questions around frozen embryos."
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, a 65-year-old grandmother in Luxor, Egypt, has dressed as a man in a traditional jalabiya for 43 years to work publicly and support her daughter after her husband died. Widowed at 21 and without family help, she first earned a few piasters brick-making, then saved to buy a shoeshine kit and joined the all-male shoeshiners. Her daughter, Houda, credits her mother with keeping the family off the streets and educating her. Despite social disapproval in Egypt’s patriarchal south—where women make up just 24% of the workforce—Dahou insists only God can judge her choice and refuses to revert to women’s dress. After a televised interview, Luxor’s governor offered her a kiosk and cash advance, which she accepted only on condition of meeting him in male attire. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi later honored her as an “ideal mother.” Throughout, Dahou maintains that posing as a man enabled her to protect her daughter from poverty and dishonor."
15695,"A Massachusetts jury, after more than 35 hours of deliberation over seven days—hearing over 130 witnesses and reviewing 400 pieces of evidence—convicted former NFL star Aaron Hernandez of first-degree murder for the 2013 shooting of Odin Lloyd. Foreperson Lesa Strachan said the six shots fired at Lloyd demonstrated unnecessary brutality. Jurors, including Rosalie Oliver (who’d never heard of Hernandez) and Kelly Dorsey (who knew him only as a Patriots player), agreed his fame and wealth didn’t influence their verdict. Many were most struck by Hernandez’s “indifference”—he and two co-defendants were seen sunbathing and drinking smoothies hours after the killing, and he left his eight-month-old daughter in their care. Co-defendants Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Sentenced to life without parole in a maximum-security prison, Hernandez’s punishment underscored jurors’ focus on evidence rather than television-style drama, and their sympathy for Lloyd’s family and young daughter."
15696,"SkyWest Flight 5622, en route from Chicago to Hartford with 84 passengers and nine crew, made an emergency descent of 28,000 feet in three minutes before landing in Buffalo after a flight attendant warned of a pressurization problem. Passenger Larry Johnson described feeling dizzy, lightheaded and helpless, and said his girlfriend and eight-month-old son were aboard. Three people briefly lost consciousness, and 15 were examined by medical teams on the ground but none were hospitalized. SkyWest maintenance found no pressurization fault, and the FAA—whose initial report cited a pressurization issue—has since removed that reference. The NTSB is gathering information alongside the FAA and SkyWest. A Yale-New Haven nurse on board treated at least two passengers who became lethargic and nauseous. CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo likened the rapid descent to a roller coaster, and Johnson said he was “glad that ride ended safely.”"
15700,"Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, stood trial for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd without offering remorse, an alibi or mitigating excuses. Instead, he displayed conspicuous swagger—winking at his fiancée and holding his head high—drawing criticism for his “arrogance,” though the author argues only the evidence mattered. The jury found him guilty of first-degree murder and unlawful weapons charges; he received life without parole. Hernandez’s rise and fall began after his father’s death in 2006: he starred at the University of Florida, earning the John Mackey Award and a BCS title, but was plagued by fights, drug incidents and a nightclub shooting inquiry. Drafted by the Patriots in 2010 as a “troubled player,” he was promptly released once charged. The author contends the NFL and Patriots handled the situation properly, that Hernandez was an unpredictable anomaly in a mostly law-abiding league, and that no organization can foresee hidden evil. As he left the courtroom, Hernandez reportedly shrugged it off, saying, “It is what it is.”"
15702,"Louis Jordan, a 37-year-old former truck driver, was rescued after drifting 66 days on his 35-foot sailboat, Angel, hundreds of miles off the Carolinas. He left Conway, South Carolina, to fish when a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast and shoulder. Despite rigging a makeshift sail, battling storms that capsized him two more times, and running out of provisions, he survived by collecting scarce rainwater and catching fish attracted to rinsed laundry. A container ship, Houston Express, spotted his listing vessel and brought him aboard in surprisingly good condition; he was flown by helicopter to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. The Coast Guard, alerted by Jordan’s father on January 29, confirmed his ordeal, noting Jordan retained remarkable physical and mental resilience—he even knew exactly which day it was when rescued. His marina community, which held a candlelight vigil during his absence, expects him back next week."
15708,"French authorities say no in-flight video has been used in the investigation of Germanwings 9525, despite reports by Paris Match and Bild that they recovered a cell-phone clip showing passengers’ cries and cockpit-door banging in the jet’s final seconds. The BEA and French gendarmerie confirm phones were seized at the Alpine crash site but not yet examined or sent for forensic analysis, and deny any leak of footage. Bild insists the video is genuine and criticizes investigators for not disclosing the phone recoveries earlier.  
Separately, Lufthansa disclosed that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had reported a “severe depression” episode in 2009 to his flight school, submitted medical paperwork to resume training, and held a valid pilot’s certificate at the time of the crash. German prosecutors in Düsseldorf noted Lubitz’s past suicidal tendencies and psychotherapy but found no evidence of recent suicidal or aggressive behavior. Investigators are probing whether fear of losing his medical clearance motivated him to crash the plane.  
On the ground, recovery teams have found no visible remains but are collecting debris and personal effects—including additional phones—to identify the 150 victims by DNA by week’s end. French President Hollande said identification should be completed sooner than initially expected."
15714,"A nuclear submarine in dry dock at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire during welding work. The blaze ignited the rubber insulation between its light and pressure hull. The sub—under repair since November 2013—had all nuclear fuel unloaded and carried no ammunition, armaments or other dangerous materials. Workers evacuated safely, no injuries were reported, and the fire poses no threat to personnel or the shipyard."
15733,"John Travolta, a longtime high‐profile Scientologist, says he hasn’t seen HBO’s new documentary Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief and isn’t interested in doing so. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times, he explained that his 40‐year experience with Scientology has been so positive that he has nothing to add to what he views as an overwhelmingly negative film. The documentary—based on Lawrence Wright’s book Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief—criticizes the Church of Scientology, which counts Travolta, Tom Cruise and Kirstie Alley among its celebrity members. Travolta attributes the film’s tone to “disgruntled” former members and says he and likely Cruise have never encountered the abuses the documentary alleges. He calls Scientology “brilliant,” credits it with helping him cope with the 2009 death of his son Jett, and notes that his wife, Kelly Preston, is also a member, as he promotes his new movie, The Forger, in Clearwater, Florida."
15735,"A Lamborghini in the Exotic Driving Experience at Walt Disney World Speedway crashed into a guardrail on Sunday. Passenger 36-year-old Gary Terry of Davenport, Florida, was killed at the scene. Driver 24-year-old Tavon Watson of Kissimmee, Florida, lost control of the car and sustained minor injuries. Petty Holdings, which runs the Exotic Driving Experience (and also the Richard Petty Driving Experience), issued a statement expressing deep sympathy for those affected by the accident. CNN’s Vivan Kuo and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to the report."
15739,"About 100 people aboard the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity—95 passengers and five crew—have fallen ill with vomiting, diarrhea and related symptoms, the CDC reports. No cause has yet been identified; two CDC staffers will board in San Diego on Monday. The ship departed San Diego on March 29 and most recently stopped in Puerto Vallarta on April 10. Celebrity Cruises has intensified cleaning and disinfection, kept passengers informed, and collected specimens for CDC testing. This marks the vessel’s third gastrointestinal‐illness outbreak (previously in 2006 and 2013); the ship was built in 2001 and refurbished in 2011."
15740,"Nearly a century ago, World War I soldiers seeking shelter in a centuries-old chalk quarry near Naours, France, etched their names and units into the walls. Photographer and ER doctor Jeff Gusky—now with National Geographic—has documented this vast underground city, carved and sealed over the centuries, rediscovered in the late 1800s, then used as refuge when the front lines drew near (notably during the 1916 Somme battle). After private ownership ended in 2013, a local consortium opened the site to researchers, who have slowly mapped its dark, maze-like galleries—complete with stone-carved maps—and uncovered 1,821 inscriptions. About 40 percent are Australian, most of the rest British, with 55 Americans and 662 untraced names. For Gusky, these startlingly fresh carvings—like “HJ Leach, merely a private, 13/7/16”—offer a poignant reminder of men who one day recorded their names and the next were fighting or even killed."
15744,"The discredited Rolling Stone story about “Jackie’s” alleged 2012 gang rape at the University of Virginia exposed a deeper issue: UVA had never expelled a student for sexual assault, even when accused students admitted guilt. In response, Virginia’s attorney general hired O’Melveny & Myers to review the university’s handling of sexual‐assault complaints—including the year-old allegations “Jackie” had reported to UVA in 2013 and only later to police, who dropped the case when she wouldn’t cooperate. Although no charges followed, the article prompted other students to share less sensational but more common acquaintance-rape experiences and to criticize campus culture, euphemisms like “bad experience,” “rapey” fraternities, date-rape drugs, and a reporting process seen as futile without expulsion. UVA then announced an undefined zero-tolerance policy and remains under a Title IX probe after a lawsuit alleging destroyed evidence. A Columbia Journalism School review faulted reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely for failing to contact “Jackie’s” alleged witnesses, whose accounts would have contradicted her. Critics say sensationalizing an extreme case has harmed survivors with more typical stories and that the article’s retraction may discourage reporting, even as others hail it for forcing UVA reform and a national conversation. Steve Coll of Columbia’s journalism school concluded that, despite flaws in “Jackie’s” narrative, Rolling Stone legitimately spotlighted UVA’s broader failures."
15747,"Chinese-born, American-based entrepreneur Jia Jiang quit his six-figure tech job at age 30—just weeks before his first child’s birth—after his start-up failed to secure funding. To conquer his fear of rejection, he launched a blog and video series called “100 Days of Rejection,” in which he asked strangers for everything from $100 to an apple. On day three he famously convinced a Krispy Kreme manager in Austin to create Olympic-style interlinked donuts, and his viral video led to talk-show appearances, speaking invitations and job offers. He’s now published a book, Rejection Proof, aiming not to escape rejection but to “turn it into opportunity,” and has racked up over seven million YouTube views.

In the book, Jiang offers eight key strategies for embracing rejection:  
1. Recognize that fear of rejection is often worse than rejection itself.  
2. Treat acceptance as a numbers game—persistence pays off.  
3. Don’t equate rejection with a lack of merit.  
4. Stay engaged after a “no” instead of fleeing.  
5. Ask “why?” to learn and adjust your approach.  
6. Prepare for a set number of “no’s” before you get to “yes.”  
7. Build your rejection “muscle” through gradual exposure.  
8. Remember that rejection reflects the rejector’s perspective, not your worth."
15753,"Over the past year, more than 25,000 people—equivalent to the population of Key West, Florida—have contracted Ebola and over 10,000 have died. Survivors face lasting consequences, and the outbreak exposed weaknesses in global and national health systems. Although worst-case forecasts of over a million cases did not materialize, dozens of new infections still occur each week. In the week of April 5, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 30 new confirmed cases—the lowest weekly total since May 2014. In Liberia and Sierra Leone, cases have fallen so sharply that treatment centers are being closed, while in Guinea, surveillance gaps remain: seven of its 19 April 5 deaths were identified as Ebola only after death, and 21 unsafe burials were recorded. WHO warns that improving surveillance may still miss hidden chains of transmission that could fuel fresh outbreaks."
15759,"The author describes being deeply disturbed by bystander video showing Officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott eight times in the back as he fled, then handcuffing him and apparently planting evidence before Scott died face-down. That footage, the author argues, is the only thing likely to bring accountability and illustrates why self-defense claims by police are met with skepticism. The piece makes the case that officer-worn body cameras—though costly to purchase and to store data—would have prevented this incident, preserved Scott’s life, reduced lawsuits, and helped rebuild public trust. While cameras are only an interim fix, they shine a light on systemic anti-Black bias in policing. True reform, the author concludes, will require tougher hiring standards, bias training, and broader social change to end racial disparities."
15778,"The CNN report describes life in the Shariya refugee camp near Duhok, Iraqi Kurdistan, home to thousands of Yazidis—mostly from Sinjar—who fled an August ISIS assault. Despite the drab tent rows, children play amid scarce toys. ISIS captured many Yazidis, separating women and girls for sexual slavery and forcing men to convert or be killed. One victim, Ahlam, was seized with her husband Mahmoud, their three young children and elderly parents, and held first in Tal Afar, then in villages where captives were beaten, paraded corpses in trucks and left unburied. Risking discovery, Ahlam secretly called Mahmoud. A week before their escape, ISIS removed the elders, prompting Ahlam and her family to flee at night toward Iraqi Kurdistan. After eight months apart, they were joyfully reunited, though Ahlam’s parents remain captive. Shortly after, ISIS released 217 mostly elderly and child Yazidis for unknown reasons. Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil, joining Iraq’s delegation to the UN, urged more international support and airstrikes, lamenting that survivors would “prefer death now” to the ongoing horrors. Ahlam, spared sexual enslavement only because she was breastfeeding, remains haunted by the screams of girls taken away."
15779,"An American citizen, 55-year-old Debra Lobo, was shot in the right cheek and left arm Thursday while driving away from Jinnah Medical and Dental College in Karachi, where she serves as vice principal. Two assailants on a motorcycle opened fire as she left to pick up her daughters; pamphlets in Urdu found in her car read “America should be burnt.” Lobo is unconscious but expected to survive and is being treated at Karachi’s Aga Khan Hospital. A Karachi police spokesman said local authorities, in close contact with the U.S. Consulate General, are investigating. Lobo, a California native, has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Christian Pakistani librarian at the American School in Karachi."
15786,"A Delaware family vacationing in a villa at the Sirenusa resort on St. John fell ill around March 20 and was airlifted to U.S. hospitals. Fathers Steve Esmond, 46, remains conscious but paralyzed; his sons, 16 and 14, are in a Philadelphia hospital in critical condition and coma; their mother, Theresa Devine, has been released and is in occupational therapy. Federal officials suspect pesticide exposure—preliminary EPA tests found methyl bromide in the rented unit, a toxic fumigant banned indoors—and investigators are sampling air and surfaces while probing a possible March 18 resort fumigation and any regulatory violations. The villa rents for $550–$1,200 per night; Sea Glass Vacations, which books the unit, says it contracts licensed pest‐control firms (Terminix, whose parent, ServiceMaster, disclosed a DOJ criminal probe in an SEC filing) and did not treat that specific villa. Terminix says it’s cooperating with authorities; final EPA results are expected next week."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) has adopted an official policy banning its members from any role in executions, deeming participation “fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers.” This move reinforces earlier APhA stances against calling lethal-injection chemicals “drugs” and opposing laws that mandate or bar pharmacist involvement in executions. The decision follows heightened scrutiny of lethal injection after the botched 2014 execution of Clayton Lockett, a Supreme Court stay in Oklahoma, and a postponed Georgia execution over cloudy drugs. With drug manufacturers like Lundbeck halting sales of pentobarbital for executions, states have resorted to compounded mixtures or alternative methods—Utah recently reinstated firing squads. APhA’s policy aligns with similar positions from the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Board of Anesthesiology."
15791,"A new approach to the climate‐change debate shifts the focus from distant emissions and industry to immediate public health risks. At a Howard University roundtable during National Public Health Week, President Obama, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy argued that linking climate change to personal health—especially respiratory problems like asthma—can motivate broader action. Obama cited Los Angeles’s once-noxious air and the success of the Clean Air Act as proof that bold policy and technology can improve health affordably. Murthy shared his personal connection through family and patients with asthma, warning that climate impacts could worsen such conditions.

Citing studies and WHO projections, the panel noted that climate change already increases heat-related illnesses, malaria, diarrhea, under-nutrition and air‐pollution deaths, and could add 250,000 deaths per year by 2050. The EPA emphasized that health effects vary by region, infrastructure and population vulnerability. Advances such as real-time air-quality apps from tech companies and coordinated planning by health professionals aim to help communities adapt. The discussion closed on the view that framing climate policy as a public-health imperative offers hope and an effective catalyst for change."
15800,"Cyclist Wang Pingan spent 460 days and 29,200 km pedaling through every major Chinese province on a shoestring budget of just over $100. As he neared the end of his journey in Shenzhen’s Huaqiangbei district, his loaded mountain bike was stolen within ten minutes of being locked up. Although police initially doubted they’d recover it, surveillance footage led them to a suspect and the bike—apparently sold twice—was identified from photos and returned. Wang, a recent university graduate who had vowed to walk home if his “old lover” wasn’t found, celebrated the reunion with his loyal companion. He’s now back on the road, bound for Hainan Island after passing through Mohe, Urumqi and Xishuangbanna."
15817,"Migrants from more than 20 countries—including Eritreans escaping repression and indefinite military service; Somalis fleeing Al-Shabaab and clan warfare; Syrians who see no future at home; and young West Africans selling all they own—converge on Libya as the principal gateway to Europe. In 2014 over 80% of Mediterranean-bound migrants used Libya’s poorly guarded coast, traversing deserts and mountains via well-established smuggling routes. Along the way they face kidnapping, robbery, starvation and abuse. Eritreans and Syrians made up half of last year’s flow, while rising numbers from Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Gambia and Nigerian Christians fleeing Boko Haram also join the exodus. Trafficking of African women for prostitution in Europe has tripled in 2014.

Smugglers—usually small groups in towns like Agadez, Sabha and Qatrun—sell “packages” combining overland and sea travel for hundreds to thousands of dollars. Better-off Syrians typically secure deck berths; Africans are often crammed into holds or inflatable dinghies, given only a compass or GPS to steer. Libya’s post-Gadhafi anarchy, tribal rivalries and ISIS affiliates compound the danger. With alternative routes through Israel and Yemen closed and neighboring countries erecting fences, migrants continue risking everything for a perilous journey immortalized in Abu Bakr Khaal’s novel African Titanics."
11317,"Walmart publicly opposed a proposed “religious freedom” law in its home state of Arkansas—joining Apple’s Tim Cook, the NCAA and dozens of other companies in warning that such legislation would sanction discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. Within hours of Walmart CEO Doug McMillon’s call for Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill or amend its language, Hutchinson confirmed he would not sign it as is.  

This intervention underscores Walmart’s growing role as a political bellwether. Earlier this year the retailer raised pay for roughly 500,000 employees well above the federal minimum wage, and over time it has expanded its nondiscrimination policies (adding gender‐identity protections in 2011 and same-sex health benefits in 2013). Its evolving stances reflect both the demands of a diverse customer base and broader shifts in public opinion—today’s support for same-sex marriage is at a record high.  

Prominent Republicans, including former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, say Walmart’s positions signal where the GOP must move if it hopes to win and retain middle-class voters—by backing reasonable minimum-wage increases and barring discrimination against gays and lesbians. The widespread business backlash against similar laws in Indiana and Arkansas has strained GOP leaders, with Jeb Bush softening his support for Indiana’s law even as Ted Cruz defended it. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton urged Arkansas’s governor to veto the measure, and regional business figures like Jay Chesshir of the Little Rock Chamber praised corporate willingness to speak out for inclusive workplace policies.  "
11323,"Easter marks Christ’s atoning death on Good Friday and his Resurrection on Sunday, yet alongside its biblical core it’s grown secular symbols (the Easter bunny and colored eggs) and a movable spring date tied to lunar events.  

At the Vatican, Holy Week began with Palm Sunday—when Jesus entered Jerusalem on a donkey—and ended with Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peter’s Square, where rain-shielded worshipers heard Pope Francis’s Urbi et Orbi plea for peace and saw him wash believers’ feet in reenactment of biblical rituals.  

In Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Western Christians celebrated the Resurrection at Calvary and Christ’s tomb, while Eastern Orthodox Christians wait a week longer, since they still follow the Julian calendar.  

Easter’s date was fixed at the Council of Nicaea (325 AD) as “the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox,” with adjustments if that full moon falls on a Sunday. When Western churches adopted the Gregorian calendar but Orthodox churches did not, two Easter dates usually resulted. A 1997 World Council of Churches proposal for a unified astronomical method failed to gain traction.  

The Easter bunny and egg customs likely came from 17th- and 18th-century German traditions: during Lent people boiled surplus eggs, then hid, gifted and dyed them at Easter, and German immigrants later brought the hare legend to North America. A modern tip: dye eggs with a Kool-Aid packet in hot water instead of vinegar for bright color—though it will stain surfaces.  

Happy Easter! Happy Passover!"
11332,"Japan’s defense minister, Gen Nakatani, told parliament that the Air Self-Defense Force has never encountered an extraterrestrial UFO. He explained that while ASDF jets are scrambled to investigate unidentified flying objects, these always turn out to be birds or human-made items, not alien craft. The question came from former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki—founder of New Japan Pro Wrestling, a one-time WWE star who fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 and entered politics in 2013—who asked whether Japan was preparing for or researching alien threats. Inoki, who claims to have seen a UFO himself but isn’t sure if aliens exist, has also pursued high-profile initiatives such as hostage negotiations in Iraq and a wrestling tour in North Korea. This exchange follows earlier debate in 2007, when then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba examined the legal issues of defending against a space invasion under Japan’s pacifist constitution."
11349,"Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old Indiana woman who battled an inoperable brain tumor, died early Friday. Diagnosed in 2013 with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, she refused to give up on her dream of playing college basketball. Mount St. Joseph University successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up its season opener so she could take the court last year; in front of a sellout crowd, she scored the game’s first two points and its final layup. 

Inspired by her tenacity, Hill helped raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research through The Cure Starts Now and became a “worldwide inspiration.” At a campus ceremony, coach Dan Benjamin, university president Tony Artez, her high-school principal Bill Snyder and others paid tribute to her unselfish spirit. An assistant coach read Hill’s own words urging people to live fully, cherish every moment and “never give up on your dreams.” Social-media tributes poured in, including from LeBron James and NCAA President Mark Emmert, all celebrating the lasting legacy of her courage and positivity."
11353,"Oregon Parks and Recreation authorities this week retrieved a 20–30-foot section of fiberglass boat off the Oregon coast—believed to have floated some 4,000 miles since Japan’s March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami. Towed into Newport’s marina, the wreckage was found to shelter live yellowtail jack fish native to Japanese waters. Biologists from the Oregon Coast Aquarium and OSU’s Hatfield Marine Science Center, after an at-sea inspection, judged the risk of invasive species to be minimal. The boat fragment will be dried, further examined and then landfilled, while the fish will be transferred to the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Richie Benaud, former Australian Test captain and celebrated cricket broadcaster, has died at 84 after treatment for skin cancer.  As a player he appeared in 64 Tests, led Australia from 1958/59 to 1963/64—never losing a series in 28 Tests—was the first to complete a Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets, and captained Australia’s inaugural full tour of India and Pakistan in 1959/60.  He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.  

After retiring, Benaud became cricket’s most famous commentator, serving more than four decades with the BBC and beloved in both Australia and Britain for his concise, witty one-liners.  His broadcasting style was hailed by peers—Gideon Haigh called him “authoritative but never pompous,” and BBC’s Jonathan Agnew deemed him “peerless”—and he set “incredibly high standards on and off the field,” according to then-Australian coach Darren Lehmann.

News of his passing drew widespread tributes: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott ordered flags at half-mast and praised Benaud’s cricketing record and commentary insight; current captain Michael Clarke and legend Shane Warne paid personal tributes on social media; and international figures including Imran Khan, Kumar Sangakkara and UK Prime Minister David Cameron also expressed their condolences."
11356,"Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenage education activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who survived a Taliban assassination attempt with no serious neurological damage, has been honored in space. NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer—who discovered Asteroid 316201 (2010 ML48) at JPL in June 2010 and also consults for PBS—named the roughly 4-kilometer, dark-surfaced asteroid “Malala” after noting, with her postdoctoral fellow Dr. Carrie Nugent, that few asteroids commemorate women of color. Orbiting between Mars and Jupiter every 5½ years, 316201 Malala recognizes Yousafzai’s fight for girls’ education, which Mainzer says is vital to tapping humanity’s full intellectual potential."
11366,"An explosion late Thursday outside the Bauchi Motor Park in Gombe killed at least five people and injured around 15 more after a woman left an explosives-laden handbag beside a bus bound for Jos. Witnesses, including station employee Adamu Saidu, said some victims lost limbs or suffered eye injuries. Grocer Falalu Tasiu described how the woman lingered by the bus, dropped the bag and walked off before it detonated, setting the vehicle alight. No group has claimed responsibility, but Boko Haram is the main suspect as it steps up attacks on soft targets amid regional military offensives. This was the first such strike since Nigeria’s weekend presidential election won by Muhammadu Buhari."
11370,"This week’s Summit of the Americas in Panama is best known for the first public meeting and historic handshake between President Obama and Cuba’s Raul Castro, but Obama hopes the summit does more than grab headlines. The United States has been losing influence in Latin America—to China, Russia and Iran—while domestic and Middle East concerns have distracted Washington from its own “backyard.” The summit offers a chance to rebuild a “natural alliance” rooted in shared heritage and bolstered by millions of U.S. residents of Latin American and Caribbean descent, provided America avoids the PR missteps that marred past gatherings—from the 2012 Cartagena prostitution scandal involving U.S. Secret Service agents to Hugo Chávez’s theatrical 2009 rebuke of a newly inaugurated Obama.

In contrast to the optimism of the early Clinton years—when the U.S. championed democracy, NAFTA and growth—the Obama team seeks to put forward a clear vision of human rights, the rule of law and economic opportunity. Its new Cuba policy and meetings with dissidents signal attention to civil liberties, but a modest U.S. sanctions plan against Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro risks handing him propaganda fodder. With corruption high and democratic norms eroding across the region, Obama’s best path to a lasting legacy is to show that U.S. goals—prosperity, free expression, fair elections—truly align with those of ordinary Latin Americans, turning the summit handshake into a foundation for real partnership."
11384,"The author opens with a personal memory of being groped on a crowded Mumbai local train at age 13—a trauma she kept secret for 25 years and that still makes her avoid trains. She then describes how sexual harassment—ranging from groping, stalking and photographing women without consent to lewd comments and catcalling—is pervasive in India’s public spaces, especially on transport. A We the People study found 80 percent of Mumbai women have been street-harassed, and a U.N. Women report cites one in three women worldwide facing sexual violence. In workshops the author has led, almost all of 2,000 participants reported harassment, yet fewer than ten had ever lodged an official complaint, deterred by shame, fear of family “disrepute” and police indifference. To combat this, she encourages women to know their legal rights and speak out. Two recent high-profile cases—the allegations against Rajendra Pachauri and Tarun Tejpal—show that reporting powerful perpetrators can bring accountability. The author urges women to overcome cultural barriers, claim their power and refuse to accept harassment as normal."
11395,"Mountaineers have returned to Everest after last year’s April 18 Khumbu Icefall collapse—an ice avalanche that killed 16 Nepali Sherpas in the deadliest incident on the mountain. To reduce risk, a Sherpa-led committee has reopened an older central route through the Icefall, which is slower and involves more crevasse crossings, ladders and gear‐weight limits, but keeps climbers away from the site of last year’s deaths. Nepal has issued 347 summit permits this season, up slightly from 334 in 2014. Meanwhile, some operators, notably Alpenglow Expeditions, are switching to Everest’s northern (Tibet) side—now hosting 320 registered climbers—to avoid the Icefall altogether. Nepalese agencies fear losing business and tourism revenue to China. Sherpas—whose guiding income supports their families—remain anxious about repeating last year’s tragedy, even as veterans like Jon Reiter, who was saved by his Sherpa guide in the avalanche, head back to attempt the summit."
11400,"In this commentary the author argues that the recent push—exemplified by Mark Cuban’s call for quarterly “every‐test” blood panels, Taylor Swift’s urging of parental cancer screenings, and Arizona’s new law allowing lab tests without a doctor’s order—signals a shift toward “National Get Tested Month.” Although over a thousand diagnostic tests are available directly to consumers in many states, self‐testing healthy people will primarily fuel more medical care, not better health. “Abnormal” results are common in well individuals, triggering extra visits, follow-up tests and procedures, anxiety and complications (from collapsed lungs to over-treatment of prostate, breast or thyroid cancers) and higher costs. The biotech industry is racing to market DNA sequencing, immune monitoring, breath and wearable sensors, and even “smart” bras. The author concludes that while self-testing need not be banned, it demands stronger FDA oversight and public education to prevent “snake oil testing” and ensure meaningful interpretation of results."
11410,"Canadian CF-18 Hornets have conducted their first airstrike against an ISIS garrison near Raqqa in Syria under an expanded mandate, successfully bombing the site before returning safely to base. Canada, which has been striking ISIS targets in Iraq since November, joined the U.S.-led coalition’s Syrian campaign following Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s announcement last month. Defense Minister Jason Kenney called ISIS a “genocidal terrorist organization” and said the strike shows Canada’s resolve to combat terrorism and deny ISIS safe haven. Casualty figures from the raid remain unclear. The campaign against ISIS also involves U.S. airstrikes in Iraq (since August) and Syria (since September), alongside contributions from other Western and Middle Eastern nations. CNN’s Tina Burnside contributed to this report."
11768,"Two recent stories have highlighted the surprise—and joy—of growing families through multiples:  
1. In Houston on April 8, Danielle and Adam Busby welcomed the world’s first all-female quintuplets since 1969. Delivered by C-section at 28 weeks and two days at the Woman’s Hospital of Texas, the girls—Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate and Riley Paige—join big sister Blayke in the Busby’s family of eight. Danielle, who conceived via intrauterine insemination, and Adam are chronicling their journey on their blog “It’s a Buzz World.” Early reports called them the first U.S. all-girl quintuplets, but 1959 San Antonio quintuplets (all girls) were born to Charles and Cecilia Hannan, though none survived beyond 24 hours.  
2. In Pensacola, Fla., Sharon and Korey Rademacher, expecting a second child, secretly learned they were having not one but two girls. When they surprised their family at Sharon’s March 11 delivery at West Florida Hospital—introducing twins Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith—they captured everyone’s reactions on video. Uploaded to YouTube, the footage has been viewed over 700,000 times."
11779,"A federal judge’s June ruling found that the government’s prior practice of neither confirming nor denying U.S. citizens’ placement on the no-fly list violated their Fifth Amendment rights. In response—under an ACLU lawsuit filed on behalf of 13 listed Americans—the Justice Department and DHS have revised the redress process. Now, U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who are denied boarding and apply through DHS’s Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) will be informed of their inclusion on the no-fly list and may request a more detailed explanation of the specific criteria used. To the extent possible without harming national security, they’ll receive an unclassified summary of that information. Listed travelers can then submit a written challenge with supporting materials and will get a final decision from TSA. The ACLU, while welcoming this transparency, argues the new process still fails to provide meaningful notice, evidence, or a hearing and plans to sue again."
11791,"In Texas, veterinarian Dr. Kristen Lindsey posted a Facebook photo of herself smiling as she dangled an orange tabby by an arrow shaft, captioning it “My first bow kill, lol. The only good feral tomcat is one with an arrow through its head!” Outraged viewers crashed the Washington County Animal Clinic’s phone lines and website. An animal rescuer later claimed the cat was actually a missing pet named “Tiger,” though CNN could not confirm this. Lindsey first insisted she’d keep her job, but the clinic soon fired her, covered her name on its marquee with duct tape, and distanced itself from her actions. Lindsey removed the post and shut down her Facebook page. The Brenham Police Department and Washington County Animal Control received flood of complaints, and the Austin County sheriff’s office—where the shooting occurred—is investigating potential charges. Animal-rights activists, led by Alley Cat Allies’ Becky Robinson, are demanding prosecution and offering a $7,500 reward for evidence. A small number of supporters, such as customer Shannon Stoddard, defended Lindsey’s character and even left balloons and a thank-you note at the clinic."
11795,"A CNN affiliate (WMAR) video shows an unnamed Baltimore mother in light blue jeans and a yellow tunic angrily pulling her masked son out of a rioting crowd, repeatedly smacking him and shouting after seeing him on TV throwing rocks at police. Once he stops and unveils his face, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts publicly praised her intervention and urged other parents to similarly take charge of their children during the unrest."
11808,"The CNN team traveled from Kathmandu to Ravi Opi, a farming village 30 km east of the capital, by way of a cracked and torn main highway—its half-meter fissures crudely filled with rubble. Even this short trip took nearly two hours, and the dirt roads beyond are slow and prone to landslides. In Ravi Opi, where villagers grow corn, millet and vegetables, 90 percent of homes are now uninhabitable. Few have motor transport, aid has yet to arrive, and families are clearing roads and returning to their fields out of necessity.  
Residents describe harrowing escapes: 62-year-old Maili Tamang crawled from the ruins of her two-story house and tended a festering leg wound, while her daughter-in-law was dug out and taken to a hospital 12 km away. Thirty-one-year-old Mahesh Koiraba lost his two-year-old daughter, Prati, under collapsing walls and now carries only her photo. As rains and aftershocks continue, displaced families shelter in makeshift huts with no government support, uncertain where to go or what the future holds. Remote villages, reachable only on foot, remain cut off and uncounted."
11817,"Marvel’s archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) dropped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to prove he’s more than a bow-and-arrow guy. At Fallon’s piano he performed a parody of Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud,” belting out a boast about his “secret powers” – from a stash of scarves and berets to trombone skills and even pickle-jar mastery. Off-screen, Renner’s résumé stretches beyond the Avengers films to Oscar-winner The Hurt Locker, American Hustle and roles in the Bourne and Mission: Impossible series."

Munn joins James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and fellow fan favorite Jubilee in the cast. Psylocke was created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe in the 1970s for Marvel’s British Captain Britain series, debuted with the X-Men in Uncanny X-Men No. 213 (1987), and has since been a fixture in titles such as Exiles and X-Force. Munn is represented by Creative Artists Agency and Atlas Artists."
11826,"Stephen Hawking has teamed up with Monty Python to re-record the troupe’s 1983 “Galaxy Song” (from The Meaning of Life) as a special 7-inch single for Record Store Day. In the accompanying video—an adaptation of a Monty Python live-show sketch—scientist Brian Cox complains about the song’s scientific errors until Hawking, in his wheelchair, silences him and delivers the lyrics in his computerized voice. The clip then launches into a psychedelic tour of the cosmos. Originally penned by Eric Idle and John Du Prez, the “Galaxy Song” combines pop-song charm with a rapid-fire lecture on the universe’s vastness. Hawking’s version is available for download, and he’s previously appeared on Pink Floyd’s “Talkin’ Hawkin’.”"
11838,"The author opens with a childhood memory of the 1980 Miami riots, sparked when four officers were acquitted in the fatal beating of Arthur McDuffie. That unrest—Miami’s first major “race riot” since the 1960s—followed a long pattern in which perceived unjust police actions ignited urban uprisings (Harlem ’64, Watts ’65, Newark and Detroit ’67, the riots after Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, and Los Angeles in 1992 after the Rodney King verdict).  

Raised by nonviolent civil-rights leaders who believed youth were central to social change, the author contrasts the disciplined demonstrations of the 1960s with the destructive protests now seen in Baltimore in 2015 after Freddie Gray’s death. While moderating a panel titled “Riot—The Voice of the Unheard?” and studying a play about Detroit ’67, she learned that rioters often act out of desperation and that past riots, though violent, prompted government investigations (the Kerner and Christopher Commissions) and led to reforms addressing racism, poverty, housing inequity and police brutality. Martin Luther King Jr.’s view that “a riot is the language of the unheard” underscores this dynamic.  

Drawing parallels to today—Baltimore youths who believed they’d be “absolved” of wrongdoing just as the author once heard the word “acquitted”—she emphasizes that real progress comes from nonviolent action. She cites Rev. Jamal Bryant’s church-based empowerment work and the largely peaceful Ferguson protests, which led to a Justice Department report on systemic bias and recommendations for police reform. Though the Baltimore riots have been contained, she notes, nonviolent voices continue to press for change."
11839,"The Israeli military said that on Sunday night it carried out airstrikes in the occupied Golan Heights—territory seized from Syria in 1967 and later annexed—against four militants who had crossed over from Syria carrying an explosive device intended to target IDF forces on the Israeli border. The strikes, which prevented the attack, killed three of the suspected attackers. Their group affiliation was not immediately known. The Golan Heights, home to some 41,000 Jews, Druze and Alawites, is internationally regarded as occupied territory despite Israeli control."

11858,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Indiana health officials are battling a severe HIV outbreak that began in mid-December among users of the prescription opioid Opana in rural Scott and Jackson counties. As of late Friday, 142 residents—136 confirmed and six preliminary cases—have tested positive, an extraordinary toll in an area of only a few thousand people. Scott County has just one non-HIV specialist infectious-disease doctor, so the state declared a public-health emergency in March, deployed Indiana University volunteer staff to run a weekly clinic (33 patients to date), and is conducting door-to-door needle-sharing education. Younger residents—unaware of HIV’s 1980s peak—have been particularly affected, said CDC’s Dr. Jonathan Mermin, who noted national HIV infections among IV drug users have fallen 90% since then. Governor Mike Pence has issued and extended a 30-day executive order authorizing needle exchanges, proven to cut new infections, and the state is offering job services. Dr. Joan Duwve of the Indiana Health Department pointed out that Ohio River communities have long battled opioid abuse, and Opana’s need for multiple daily injections with large-gauge needles has accelerated HIV and hepatitis C spread—a 150% rise in hepatitis C from 2010 to 2013. Mermin warned this outbreak “should serve as a warning” that infectious diseases can rebound without vigilance."
11860,"Longtime friend Leslie Morris has filed an April 28 petition to be named conservator of singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell—inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997—who was found unconscious in her home a month ago and remains at UCLA Medical Center. In her petition, Morris describes Mitchell as “unconscious and unable to make any responses,” but a same-day statement on Mitchell’s official website (approved by Morris) says she is alert, comprehends, not in a coma, and expected to make a full recovery, with Morris merely gaining authority to make care decisions after discharge. Publicist Alisse Kingsley confirmed the website account as accurate. A physician’s declaration indicates Mitchell will likely be unable to attend court hearings for four to six months. Meanwhile, fans are posting tributes at WeLoveYouJoni.com. The report includes contributions from Sonya Hamasaki and Cheri Mossburg."
11870,"A new book, Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer, due May 5, will detail alleged conflicts of interest from foreign governments and corporations that donated to the Clinton Foundation and its offshoot, the Clinton Global Initiative.  Critics note that in 2014 the foundation took money from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Canada’s foreign affairs department—which was backing the Keystone XL pipeline that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department later approved as having minimal environmental impact.  Likewise, at least six banks under investigation or fined by regulators sponsored Clinton Global Initiative meetings, though there is no documented “quid pro quo” or evidence the Clintons knew of those probes.  Beyond potential conflicts, the charities have struggled with poor management: a con man once duped them with a $50 million pledge that never materialized, staff feuded over direction, and they ran deficits of $40 million in 2007–08 and $8 million in 2012.  Absent a conclusive smoking-gun revelation, these issues are unlikely to sway voters more concerned with unemployment, education and taxes—and polls show 57% expect Clinton to win in 2016.  Clinton herself has dismissed such scrutiny as a distraction."
11875,"Andrew Lesnie, the 59-year-old Sydney–born cinematographer best known for his decade-long collaboration with Peter Jackson on the six Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, has died of a heart attack. An Oscar winner for The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Lesnie also shot Jackson’s King Kong (2005) and The Lovely Bones (2009), as well as Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), I Am Legend (2007), The Last Airbender (2010), Healing (2014) and Russell Crowe’s directorial debut, The Water Diviner, which opened in U.S. theaters the week he died. He was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002. Lesnie trained at TAFE and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, began his career at the Australian Broadcasting Corp., and worked on shorts, music videos, documentaries, commercials and the children’s show Wonder World. A spokesman said his family will issue an official statement; Crowe called his passing “devastating news from home” and Jackson had praised his “magical” use of natural light."
11877,"From 2010 through 2014, ambushes were the leading cause of felonious line-of-duty deaths among U.S. law enforcement officers. Despite this threat—and a documented case in which Ismaaiyl Brinsley used Waze to locate and then kill two New York police officers—Google continues to market Waze’s “traffic cop” feature, which lets any of its 50 million users mark officers’ field locations as “visible” or “invisible.” Although Waze’s real-time, crowd-sourced alerts can help drivers avoid traffic jams or accidents, they can equally aid speeders, drunk drivers, domestic abusers, gang members, drug dealers, or terrorists in evading or targeting police. Google, which purchased Waze in 2013, insists the app serves the “common good,” but it has refused to meet with the National Sheriffs’ Association to address safety concerns. Law enforcement representatives argue that, with modest changes and cooperation from Google, the app could continue aiding motorists without endangering officers."
11888,"Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe’s “Toy Soldiers” project confronts our growing desensitization to images of war by staging real Polisario Front soldiers in the desert of Western Sahara as if they were the familiar green plastic figurines of childhood.  Working at historic battle sites, Thorpe—whose roots are in landscape photography—secured permission to move 50–60 troops at a time (avoiding a UN clearance requirement) and even enlisted them to build oil-drum platforms.  Shooting long days in the autumn heat with a wide-angle lens, he captured scenes that, at first glance, appear toy-like but on closer inspection are very real.  His aim is to prompt viewers to reconsider how future audiences will engage with conflict imagery amid ever-shortening attention spans.  Thorpe’s five-week series is available for pre-order from Dewi Lewis Publishing."
11900,"On Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina, 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III—a former student and one-time employee of the victim—walked into a campus building and fatally shot longtime print shop operator Ron Lane. The college was placed on lockdown, all buildings were cleared, and the armed suspect remains at large. Authorities, describing the incident as isolated rather than random, even deployed tear gas into a restroom where they mistakenly believed the shooter was hiding. College President Kay Albertson called it “a sad day,” praised the rapid multiagency response, and said the school will support Lane’s family. In fall 2013 the two-year college enrolled 3,837 students (just over half part-time). From 2011 to 2013 the school had no killings, assaults, robberies or motor-vehicle thefts, and logged three weapons‐possession arrests in each of 2012 and 2013."
11908,"Colorado’s New Belgium Brewery and Ben & Jerry’s are collaborating on a beer flavored like salted caramel brownie ice cream and tied to a joint social-activism campaign. While details of the campaign remain under wraps, New Belgium’s Director of Sustainability Jenn Vervier and Ben & Jerry’s Senior Global Marketing Manager Jay Curley promise it will be “impactful,” with the beer slated to hit shelves this fall and full information released later in the year. Both certified B Corporations, New Belgium and Ben & Jerry’s share a history of environmental, social and fair-trade advocacy. Though Ben & Jerry’s cofounder has teased marijuana-infused ice cream, no beer-flavored ice cream is planned."
11910,"Wisconsin ended Kentucky’s bid for a perfect season by rallying from a 60–56 deficit to win 71–64 in Saturday’s Final Four semifinal in Indianapolis. Frank Kaminsky paced the Badgers with 20 points and 11 rebounds, while Sam Dekker added 16. Kentucky’s Karl-Anthony Towns led his team with 16 points. Wisconsin out-rebounded Kentucky by 12 and sealed the win with an 8-0 run.  
In the other semifinal, Duke defeated Michigan State 81–61. Freshman Justise Winslow scored 19 points, Jahlil Okafor had 18 (including 10 in the first half), and Quinn Cook added 17. Michigan State’s Denzel Valentine led his team with 22 points and 11 rebounds but couldn’t stop Duke’s defense and inside scoring.  
Monday’s national championship game will feature Wisconsin seeking its first title since 1941 against Duke, which is aiming for its fifth NCAA crown."
11911,"Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam renewed a call for U.N.-sponsored peace talks “only after a complete halt of attacks,” as Saudi-led airstrikes pounded southern Yemen. The previous round collapsed in January when Houthis attacked President Hadi’s residences in Sanaa. Saudi Arabia announced an end to its “Operation Decisive Storm” air campaign and the start of “Operation Renewal of Hope,” aimed at political reconciliation, but resumed strikes within 24 hours after Houthi forces struck a government brigade in Taiz province. Five strikes on a weapons depot were reported late Wednesday.  

Meanwhile the Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi, whom they had detained near Aden on March 26. Saudi officials say their month-long campaign has degraded Houthi military infrastructure in Sanaa, met nearly all U.N. Security Council demands—including the exile of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh—and will now focus on civilian protection, humanitarian aid, counter-terrorism, maritime security and border defense.  

President Hadi, backed by the coalition, vowed to rebuild Yemen’s military and institutions once the Houthis withdraw. In the south, two U.S. drone strikes killed six al-Qaeda suspects in Mukalla—the second such strike in three days—as U.S. forces conduct maritime reconnaissance off Yemen."
11922,"Falih Essawi, deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, reports that ISIS fighters are closing in on Ramadi—70 miles west of Baghdad and capital of Anbar province—and government forces “may not hold their front lines” much longer. Fighting on Wednesday left at least 10 Iraqi security personnel dead and over 100 wounded as ISIS pressed into three eastern approaches—Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem and Soufia—and rolled into central Ramadi. Essawi, who says he is armed with a machine gun on the front, pleaded for reinforcements from Baghdad and for U.S.-led coalition air support.  

The offensive has driven roughly 150,000 residents to flee since Wednesday morning, many trekking east toward Baghdad with carts carrying elderly family members. CNN interviews with families from Albu Ghanem describe Iraqi forces’ withdrawal and militants setting up sniper positions in civilian homes.  

Despite months of U.S. airstrikes—including seven near Ramadi since Monday—the city remains fiercely contested. U.S. officials contend its fall is “not imminent,” even though large sections are under ISIS control or influence."
11932,"Equal Pay Day falls on April 14 because, at the current 2014 wage gap, women must work until then in 2015 to earn what men did in 2014. On average, women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns—and less still for women of color—costing a typical woman $431,000 over a 40-year career. Closing the gap would lift half of working single mothers out of poverty and put more money into the hands of consumers, stimulating real economic growth rather than tax cuts for the wealthy.

The author argues that Hillary Clinton—who has cast herself as a populist champion of the middle class—should stage a political stunt by taking a 23 percent pay cut (the inverse of the wage gap) on the presidential salary. Though largely symbolic, it would reinforce her solidarity with working women, highlight nationwide inequity, and lend tangible credibility to her pledge to fix pay inequality if elected."
11945,"Today’s jihadi groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram employ systematic sexual violence and enslavement of women as a deliberate strategy in building their self-declared “caliphates.” Unlike earlier jihadis (for whom state-building was a distant goal), ISIS and Boko Haram capture, force-convert, traffic, and sell women—especially non-Muslims like Yazidis—into slave markets or “marriage” with fighters. Investigations and medical exams confirm organized rape, sexual slavery, and forced marriage that Human Rights Watch labels war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. Boko Haram’s abduction of some 2,000 girls, including the 276 Chibok students, illustrates how women are moved from house to house under draconian rules. These groups justify enslavement through selective Islamic texts and incorporate women into daily life—subjecting them to extreme restrictions, abuse, and despair. Their cruelty is not random sadism but a methodical tool to humiliate enemies, reward fighters, and secure the domestic and reproductive labor needed for a conservative, Sharia-ruled society."
11948,"SpaceX plans to try, for the first time, to land the first stage of its two-stage Falcon 9 rocket upright on an autonomous “drone ship” in the Atlantic after launching an uncrewed Dragon cargo capsule to the International Space Station (ISS). Monday’s launch from Cape Canaveral was scrubbed by weather; the next opportunity is set for Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET. If successful, the recovery could dramatically cut launch costs—Elon Musk hopes to make rockets as reusable as airplanes—and follows a January attempt that ended in an angled crash. SpaceX rates its landing odds at about 50% and will post photos and video online; it plans to keep trying and eventually land rockets on solid ground.  

Meanwhile, the Falcon 9’s upper stage will carry Dragon into orbit, then burn up, while Dragon docks with the ISS two days later with over 4,300 lb of supplies (including an “ISSpresso” coffee maker). After about five weeks, the crew will load Dragon with more than 3,000 lb of experiments and trash, and mission controllers will guide it to a Pacific Ocean splashdown off California. This is SpaceX’s sixth ISS mission; the company was the first private contractor to dock there."
11979,"Jurors in the Boston Marathon bombing trial of 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have been deliberating more than seven hours without reaching a verdict; they sent two questions to the judge and will resume Wednesday. Tsarnaev faces 30 federal counts—including using weapons of mass destruction at a public event—with 17 carrying life or death sentences; a guilty verdict on any of those would trigger a penalty phase weighing aggravating evidence against his background.

Prosecutors opened with graphic videos and photos of the April 15, 2013 blasts on Boylston Street—one pressure-cooker device set by Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, the second, allegedly by Dzhokhar, killed 8-year-old Martin Richard and 23-year-old Lingzi Lu—and recalled the later killing of MIT officer Sean Collier. They portrayed the brothers as “mujahedeen” who chose Patriots’ Day to terrorize civilians, then carjacked a Mercedes, fought police in Watertown (Tamerlan was killed), and say Dzhokhar wrote a jihadist “manifesto” in his hiding place.

Defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded her client’s role but argued he was influenced and led by his older brother, urging jurors to spare his life. Federal prosecutors called 92 witnesses; the defense called four."
12008,"A group of 21-year-old journalism students at Kent State say they’re in no rush to marry—preferring careers, debt-free partners and travel to expensive weddings or traditional family roles. Their attitude isn’t unique: U.S. remarriage has jumped from 14 million adults in 1960 to nearly 42 million today, and a Pew survey finds half of Americans think it’s fine to put goals other than marriage and children first (66% of them aged 18–29). Economists note married couples often enjoy higher combined incomes, though it’s unclear whether marriage creates wealth or wealthy people simply marry more. Meanwhile, heavy student debt deters many would-be spouses from planning weddings. In parts of Scandinavia—where 82% of Norwegian couples have children out of wedlock and cohabitation (“sambo”) carries no legal or social penalty—marriage rates have also plunged even as these countries top global quality-of-life rankings. Critics there argue secular life raises expectations that partnerships can’t always meet, so people opt to stay single. The author, once skeptical of marriage after her parents’ divorce, married at 38 and now sees marriage as both a declaration of love and a practical commitment—but leaves open the question of whether a largely unmarried society could thrive just as well."
12060,"Iraqi government forces, backed by roughly 20,000 Iranian-supported Shiite militiamen and U.S.-led airstrikes, fully recaptured Saddam Hussein’s birthplace of Tikrit after nine months of ISIS rule. As troops swept through the city, they discovered hundreds of IEDs, explosive-laden vehicles (including a booby-trapped digger), and likely booby-trapped buildings. Iraqi federal police reported dismantling hundreds of bombs, and authorities heard at least 16 controlled detonations as they cleared resistance.  

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, also the country’s top military commander, declared victory a year after ISIS first seized Tikrit. Remaining fighters are believed to be hiding in homes, awaiting darkness to escape. Officials warned that sectarian reprisals by Shiite militias against the predominantly Sunni local population—still wary after last year’s massacre of Shiite cadets by ISIS—could reignite tensions and threaten long-term stability.  

ISIS’s occupation had been brutal: over 1,500 air force cadets were massacred at Camp Speicher, victims were buried in mass graves, and an eighth-century Assyrian church was destroyed. With Tikrit secured, al-Abadi said the same “surprise” tactics would be used elsewhere, setting the stage for a planned offensive on Mosul. The U.S. deputy envoy Brett McGurk affirmed continued airstrike support for Iraqi forces reclaiming territory from ISIL."
12068,"The International Committee of the Red Cross on Saturday urged a 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen so that urgently needed food, water, medical supplies and personnel can reach wounded civilians—particularly around Aden, where two weeks of heavy fighting have left many in critical condition. Its Near and Middle East operations chief, Robert Mardini, warned that without prompt care “many more people will die,” a point underscored by ICRC spokeswoman Marie-Claire Feghali in Sanaa. The appeal came just before a U.N. Security Council meeting—at which Russia’s draft resolution calling for an end to Saudi-led airstrikes and no call for Houthi disarmament or negotiations failed to advance.  
Yemen has spiraled into conflict since Shiite Houthi rebels ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from Sanaa in January. Hadi briefly regrouped in Aden before fleeing to Saudi Arabia in late March. In response to Houthi gains, a Saudi-led Arab coalition launched air campaigns last week. The U.N. reports at least 519 dead and 1,700 wounded over two weeks, tens of thousands displaced to Somalia and Djibouti, and 58 killed in Aden alone in the past two days.  
Meanwhile, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula controls parts of eastern Yemen; militants freed senior leader Khaled Batarfi and about 270 prisoners in al Mukalla. On Saturday, French forces evacuated 44 people from Balhaf."
12073,"NYPD Detective Patrick Cherry, who holds top‐secret clearance with the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, has been placed on modified assignment and faces possible suspension, reassignment or loss of clearance after video surfaced of him angrily confronting an Uber driver over a failed blinker signal. In the footage—posted by passenger Sanjay Seth—Cherry yells, mocks the driver’s accent, threatens arrest and uses expletives. Cherry apologized publicly to the driver, passengers, Police Commissioner William Bratton and the community. Bratton condemned the behavior as unacceptable, and Mayor Bill de Blasio stressed respect for all. The NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau and the Civilian Complaint Review Board are investigating, and Uber has offered support to its driver."
13806,"Cameron Hardin’s third week as Head of Household ended after he nominated Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes and used the Power of Veto to keep both on the block. At the October 5 eviction, all seven voting houseguests—Cory, Cirie, Blue, Matt, Jag, America and Bowie—cast their votes to evict Mecole Hayes by a 7–0 margin; Mecole left after urging them to target Cory and America. In the subsequent HOH competition, which quizzed eight players on Instagram-style photos in true-or-false rounds, Bowie Jane and Felicia tied with perfect scores. Bowie won the tiebreaker by closest guess to how many minutes Jared Fields spent as a zombie, marking her first competition win and Week 10 HOH reign. She will host Friday’s nomination ceremony. Additional updates mention Cirie Fields setting a BB record, plans for an all-winners season in winter, the Traitors 2 cast reveal, and that Big Brother 25 airs on CBS."
13814,"Social Security recipients will receive a 3.2% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) on their monthly benefits beginning January 2024—an average increase of just over $50 (about $57.30 on the typical $1,790 benefit). This annual COLA, tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, helps retirees keep pace with inflation. At the same time, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax will rise to $168,600 (up from $160,200 in 2023). Beneficiaries can view COLA notices online or receive alerts through My Social Security in early December."
13815,"Tonee Turner, a 22-year-old Pittsburgh artist and metal fabricator who also taught ceramics part-time, went missing on December 30, 2019. She was last seen at Dobra Tea around 6:00 p.m., when she spoke by phone with her sister. A cyclist later found her purse—with her phone, wallet, and keys—near a bridge off Interstate 80 by Homestead. Tonee is 5′3″, 130 lb, with chin-length dark hair, brown eyes, multiple facial piercings and a spiral tattoo on her left shoulder. She was wearing a black zip-up jacket, a gray “Habla Espanol” shirt, gray cargo pants and possibly a black head wrap. Anyone with information should contact Pittsburgh Police (412-323-7800; case #19-264396). Tonee’s family continues to search door-to-door and urges the community to share any leads."
13816,"• Xanax (alprazolam) is a benzodiazepine prescribed for anxiety that works by boosting GABA activity in the brain, producing a calming effect.  
• It offers rapid relief for acute anxiety episodes, making it useful for short-term or emergency use.  
• With repeated use, tolerance can develop, leading to higher required doses and raising the risk of dependence and withdrawal.  
• For chronic anxiety, sustainable approaches like therapy, lifestyle changes, or alternative medications are often preferable; long-term Xanax use demands careful monitoring and complementary strategies.  
• While effective for immediate symptom relief, Xanax should be used cautiously and under medical supervision as part of a broader, holistic anxiety-management plan."
13823,"The Pentagon has confirmed that about 900 U.S. troops, including soldiers from Texas’s Fort Cavazos (Killeen) and Fort Bliss (El Paso), are deploying to the Middle East to bolster air-defense and protect forces from drone and rocket attacks. Most Fort Bliss personnel will operate a THAAD battery (which intercepts ballistic missiles inside and outside the atmosphere), while the remainder join Fort Cavazos troops as “air defense headquarters elements.” The other deploying units will staff Patriot batteries from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Patriot and Avenger batteries from Fort Liberty, North Carolina. This reinforcement follows at least 12 attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and four in Syria over the past week (plus one failed strike), which have left 21 U.S. service members with mostly minor injuries, including traumatic brain injuries. Department of Defense spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the forces will not go to Israel but will support regional deterrence and force‐protection."
13827,"Big Brother 25 spoilers reveal that new Head of Household Bowie Jane is under pressure to backdoor competition standout Cameron Hardin before he grows too powerful. Although Cameron’s allies Matt Klotz and Jag Bains (“The Fugitives”) are split—Jag wants him gone, Bowie isn’t convinced—Bowie has instead nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields and won’t yet consider Cameron as a replacement. Cameron and fellow nominee Cory Wurtenberger both lobby Bowie to target the other, but she’s hesitant. This week’s Power of Veto players are Bowie, Felicia, Cirie, Jag, Matt and America (with Cory hosting). If America, Cirie or Felicia wins, Bowie must name a replacement nominee—possibly Cory—when the Veto competition concludes Saturday evening."
13829,"Cameron Hardin was “backdoored” and evicted in Week 10 of Big Brother 25 after the house united against his frequent challenge wins and poor social ties—Felicia Cannon even accused him of harboring an “evil spirit.” Immediately afterward, Jag Bains won a BB Comics Secret HOH competition and quietly nominated Blue Kim and Felicia, prompting both and Cirie Fields to voice regret over Cameron’s exit and praise his upfront play. Cameron’s warning to Blue that Jag and Matt Klotz would target her proved true when she found herself on the block. In Week 11, a Double Veto will shake up the game, and someone will join Cameron in the jury house. Additionally, Michael Bruner (BB 24) recently married, and Cameron’s exit interview highlighted who he thinks is playing the best and worst games. Big Brother 25 airs Sundays at 10/9 c, Tuesdays at 8/7 c, and Thursdays at 9/8 c on CBS."
13834,"Jag Bains won Week 10’s Power of Veto in the OTEV challenge and will use it at Monday’s Veto Meeting. New HOH Bowie Jane—her first challenge victory—had nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields, still upset over earlier conflicts, but now plans to backdoor Cameron Hardin by naming him as the replacement nominee. Felicia claimed Bowie Jane threw the POV comp and Cirie blamed America Lopez; Cameron didn’t compete. If Cameron goes, he’d be BB25’s first jury member. In the lead-up, other houseguests are whispering false stories about Cameron to Bowie Jane, Matt Klotz distrusts Cameron’s version of events with Cirie, and Cirie has spoken ill of Matt. CBS also unveiled its October BB25 schedule, and Peacock revealed The Traitors Season 2 cast of Survivor, The Bachelor and Big Brother alumni."
13840,"New York Republican Anthony D’Esposito has filed a privileged motion in the U.S. House to expel fellow New York GOP Rep. George Santos after 23 new federal charges against Santos—including unauthorized credit-card charges on donors and identity theft—were brought to light. D’Esposito, joined by Reps. Nick LaLota, Marc Molinaro and Mike Lawler, argues that Santos is unfit for office, pointing also to earlier allegations that Santos fabricated much of his resume. A floor vote is scheduled for next week, but House Republicans’ slim 221–212 majority and the 290-vote threshold for expulsion give party leaders incentives to table or refer the motion to committee rather than force a full vote. Santos says he will not resign, and even if the measure reaches the floor, it would require at least 78 Republicans to break ranks with leadership."
13842,"Survivor host Jeff Probst has tightened the show’s “sit-out” rule after fans complained that its previous wording—no sitting out consecutive challenges within a single cycle—was confusing under the new, shortened 26-day format. Under the revised rule introduced in Episode 2 of Season 45, “you cannot sit out of back-to-back challenges, period,” so anyone who skips one challenge must compete in the very next one. The simpler rule was prompted by Season 44’s Claire Rafson, who sat out three straight Immunity Challenges and drew fan and cast criticism, prompting Probst to address the issue on his On Fire podcast.  

Meanwhile, Survivor has expanded to 90-minute episodes on Wednesdays (8/7c on CBS), partly due to Hollywood strike delays, with past Season 45 installments streaming on Paramount+. Cast dynamics are also in focus: Hannah Rose voluntarily left at the first Tribal Council—drawing mixed reactions online—and recently eliminated Brandon Donlon revealed he suffered a panic attack and blackout while completing a game goal."
13843,"For the week of October 23 on The Young and the Restless, Nick Newman confronts his brother Adam over Sally Spectra’s divided affections and demands that Sally choose between them. After learning Sally still has feelings for Adam, Nick ends their relationship and even physically attacks Adam to keep him away. Torn between a growing love for Nick and a strong connection with Adam—intensified when she sleeps with Adam—Sally refuses to pick a side and considers walking away from them both. Their feud erupts into a brawl that Sally breaks up, with Nick again insisting she decide once and for all. Spoilers promise her ultimate choice will shock viewers."
13846,"Rice University researchers have secured $45 million to develop HAMMR, a three-inch, rechargeable implant that continuously monitors tumors and delivers immunotherapy drugs in a closed-loop system. By wirelessly communicating real-time tumor data—potentially via smartphone—the device can adjust dosing on the fly, aiming to eradicate cancer in as little as 60 days. Current diagnostic tools only offer infrequent “snapshots” of tumor activity; HAMMR’s real-time feedback is designed to guide more precise, personalized treatments. Human trials targeting recurrent ovarian cancer are planned within five years, with the technology also holding promise for other peritoneal cancers."
13848,"The article notes that after a close, nationally televised loss to the Eagles, the Dolphins are eyeing defensive reinforcements ahead of the trade deadline. With key players like Xavien Howard, Jalen Ramsey and Terron Armstead soon returning from injury, Miami still needs more pass-rush help. CBS Sports reports multiple teams might trade for Commanders’ edge rusher Chase Young or Montez Sweat. Young, at 24 and already credited with five sacks this season, would represent a major upgrade over underperforming Emmanuel Ogbah and a struggling line that includes Christian Wilkins. Acquiring Young would require committing to a new long-term deal—something Miami has done recently for Jonathan Taylor—and would bolster a front four featuring Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb as the Dolphins push toward the playoffs."
13850,"In February 1988, a body wrapped in plastic and duct tape inside a nylon suitcase was found in a Jenkins County, Georgia, dumpster. The victim, who had died of asphyxiation four to seven days earlier, eluded identification for 35 years despite attempts using fingerprints, dental records, a forensic sketch and early DNA tests. In 2023, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation partnered with Othram, Inc. for advanced DNA genealogy—funded by “Project Justice”—which generated leads that identified the victim as 26-year-old Chong Un Kim, a Korean immigrant living in Hinesville. Kim’s family was notified in October 2023. The GBI is now urging anyone with information to call 912-871-1121, submit tips online, or use the See Something, Send Something app."
13857,"Big Brother 25’s final five—Felicia Cannon, Bowie Jane, Jag Bains, Cirie Fields and Matt Klotz—competed in a late-night Head of Household competition after back-to-back unanimous evictions of Blue Kim and America Lopez. When the feeds returned, Matt Klotz emerged as HOH for the first time this season, giving him the power to nominate two houseguests for eviction on Friday, October 27. Everyone will then vie for the Power of Veto, setting up a pivotal Veto Meeting. Matt must choose between his alliances—his final-three pact with Jag and Bowie, his final-four group with Felicia, Cirie and Jag, or a new duo with Cirie and Jag—making Felicia, Cirie or Bowie the most likely nominees. With only two weeks (86 days played) left before the finale, viewers can catch footage of America and Blue heading to the jury house on November 2, a special midweek eviction episode, and the season’s conclusion on CBS (Sunday 10/9c, Tuesday 8/7c, Thursday 9/8c) or via Paramount+ and Pluto TV."

13872,"Even if the federal government shuts down, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—the agency that processes work permits and related applications for asylum seekers—will continue operating on the fees it collects. Last week, the Biden administration added Venezuelan nationals who entered by July 31 to those eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), potentially speeding up work permits for thousands in New York City. USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou toured a migrant reception center in New York, where federal staff hand out information, answer questions, and run a work-authorization support center alongside the Red Cross. To accelerate permit processing, USCIS now offers mobile fingerprinting, library education sessions, and email/SMS eligibility alerts. Jaddou says the agency aims to decide applications in about 30 days but needs additional congressional funding to handle more permits and TPS requests."
13874,"China has just launched its first nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines, giving its navy the ability to strike land targets at long range from submarines and surface ships. This development, echoing Soviet Cold-War efforts to target U.S. carriers, boosts China’s power-projection wherever these subs operate. The Pentagon report also warns that China’s deployed nuclear warheads could rise from about 500 today to nearly 1,000 by 2030, supported by over 300 new ICBM silos now under construction. It notes China may be exploring conventionally armed, intercontinental-range missiles capable of striking the U.S. Meanwhile, China’s navy—currently the world’s largest with some 370 ships and submarines—is set to grow to about 435 vessels by 2030, and its simulated attacks and rhetoric against Taiwan merit serious attention."

13894,"Summary of core information:
• Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were cutting Texas’s concertina wire along the southern border.  
• On October 30, U.S. District Judge Alia Moses granted Paxton’s request for a temporary restraining order barring agents from removing or damaging the wire, with one exception for medical emergencies that would otherwise risk serious injury or death.  
• The order is in effect until November 13, and both sides will present full arguments on November 7.  
• Paxton expressed confidence in ultimately prevailing; the Biden administration argues the wire was cut to provide medical aid and that agents must take unauthorized crossers into custody under federal law.

As the passage provides no further details on Ms. Moses’s reasoning at the November 7 hearing, it is not possible, based solely on the information given, to predict her final ruling."
13895,"Illinois Senate President Don Harmon is facing scrutiny for backing a bill that would reclassify private, for-profit nursing homes in Cook County from commercial to residential property—slashing their property taxes—after receiving nearly $2 million in campaign contributions from the industry’s trade group, the Health Care Council of Illinois PAC (over $700,000 in the past year, including $10,000 on October 19, $100,000 on September 30 and $5,000 on August 23). Harmon has declined to comment on the contributions or his vote; his spokesman insists decisions are made in the public interest. Ron Nunziato of the Health Care Council defended Harmon’s long-standing support for nursing homes and denied any direct quid pro quo.  
The tax-reclassification amendment, first filed by State Sen. Celina Villanueva in May—with input from Harmon’s legislative staff—cleared the General Assembly but was removed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s amendatory veto, which warned that the break would shift costs onto suburban homeowners and small businesses. The nursing home lobby is now pushing to override the veto; while Harmon’s position on an override is unclear, his Senate chief of staff, Jacob Butcher, is reportedly a strong supporter."
13911,"Rosalie Wahl’s 1977 appointment as Minnesota’s first female Supreme Court justice marked a milestone in the state’s legal history. Born Sara Rosalie Erwin in 1924 in Kansas and raised by her grandmother after early family losses, she studied sociology at the University of Kansas during World War II, where her commitment to social justice began. After moving to Minnesota, marrying Ross Wahl, and raising four children, she entered William Mitchell College of Law in 1962, excelled academically, and served as an assistant public defender. Governor Rudy Perpich tapped her for the Supreme Court bench, where over more than thirty years she authored 549 opinions noted for their clarity, upheld legislative intent, and advanced independent constitutional standards. As chair of task forces on gender fairness and racial bias, she drove reforms benefiting women and minorities in Minnesota’s courts. Nationally, Wahl influenced legal education and accreditation through her work with the American Bar Association, emphasizing practical skills training for law students. Her pioneering career championed gender equality, racial justice, and the rights of the underserved—and her legacy continues to inspire."
13916,"The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Dollar General after a Georgia employee was fired in September 2020 immediately upon disclosing her pregnancy. Her manager questioned her ability to work while pregnant, and she was given a separation notice citing “health reasons.” Dollar General has agreed to pay $42,500 to settle the claim. The EEOC stresses that pregnancy is not a valid basis for assuming an employee cannot perform her job and enforces federal protections—among them the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act—to prevent such discrimination."

13925,"A former FBI agent and a D.C. real estate developer were sentenced for running an extensive bribery scheme that traded on confidential data from the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development:  
• Defendants  
  – David Paitsel, 42, ex-FBI agent (North Carolina)  
  – Brian Bailey, 53, real estate developer (Upper Marlboro, MD)

13926,"The governor’s office under Josh Shapiro agreed this fall to pay $295,000 to settle a sexual-harassment and retaliation claim against former legislative affairs secretary Mike Vereb.  Key points:  
• Allegations: A former staffer said Vereb made lewd, misogynistic remarks and retaliated when she complained. Vereb has since resigned.  
• Settlement breakdown: $196,365 to the complainant; just over $49,000 to legal firms. Finalized in early September and disclosed via an open-records request.  
• Office commitments: Mandatory sexual-harassment training for all Policy and Legislative Affairs staff, and permission for the woman to seek other state-government or contractor roles.  
• Administration’s stance: No further comment under the settlement terms. Governor Shapiro quietly met with women Democratic senators as the allegations surfaced but has otherwise stayed silent.  
• Why it matters: The case spotlights the need for respect and integrity in government workplaces and offers Pennsylvania an impetus to improve its office culture."

He has instructed the Texas Department of Public Safety to bolster security at synagogues, schools and other Israel-related sites statewide, warned of potential Hezbollah or Hamas threats to Texas Jews, and barred all state agencies from buying or exporting goods to the Gaza Strip if they have ties to Hamas. Abbott also allocated $4 million in grants to 31 Jewish organizations for security upgrades and ordered the Texas flag flown at half-staff through Saturday in honor of those killed in the conflict.

Though noted for basketball, she just completed a 13–8 volleyball season—one in which the Lady Braves fell in the second playoff round to the eventual state champions—and has surpassed 1,000 career points in basketball and 1,000 career kills in volleyball. At 5'11"", Moore averaged 20 points and 8.2 rebounds per game last basketball season, leading TCHS to a 29–3 record and a 4A state quarterfinal appearance; she was also named to the 2023 Mississippi Coaches Association North All-Star Game.

It will be the 1,100th round of the Formula One World Championship and one of 23 races on the 2023 calendar. The event uses a newly created 3.8-mile temporary street circuit running partly along a two-kilometer stretch of the Las Vegas Strip. After more than 30 proposals, the FIA approved a counterclockwise, high-speed layout with 14 turns, three straights and three DRS zones.

13495,"Luis Alfredo Jacobo, a Bakersfield, California–based drug kingpin, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour to four concurrent life terms—one for directing a continuing criminal enterprise and three for methamphetamine conspiracy—plus four years for unlawful use of a communication facility. From 2016 to 2021, Jacobo oversaw multiple meth distribution rings spanning California, Northeast Oklahoma and Southwest Missouri, coordinating with more than a dozen accomplices. He arranged bulk shipments (sometimes up to 200 lbs), set prices and delivery methods, and funneled cash proceeds—occasionally mailed in sums up to $100,000—back to California. Three separate Oklahoma conspiracies were managed by his regional operatives. Trial evidence included intercepted communications, financial records and search-warrant findings, notably a 2020 Grove, Oklahoma, haul of 231 lbs of meth and $465,000 from a Jacobo-rented storage unit, and the 2021 arrest of codefendant Tony Garcia with 30 lbs of meth and a handgun. Jacobo’s conviction stemmed from Operation “Pullin Chains,” led by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the DEA."
13499,"On October 1, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler—president of EMILY’s List and Maryland resident—to fill the U.S. Senate seat of the late Dianne Feinstein, who died September 29 after serving from 1992. Butler, a Democratic strategist and labor‐movement leader, has been an advisor to Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, executive director of SEIU California, director of public policy and campaigns for Airbnb in North America, and a partner at SCRB Strategies.

Because the CME had slower solar‐wind speeds and no obvious chart spike, many aurora watchers missed it; the only early clues were a brief satellite‐data gap, a slight rise in solar wind speed and a gradual drop into negative Bz values (indicating better magnetic alignment). Forecaster Charlie Bourdo recognized those subtle signs hours ahead of the display and has since posted a “how-to” video on aurora forecasting.

13554,"Cristina Michelle Husbands, a 48-year-old from Dallas, Texas, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Sul Ozerden to 64 months in prison and five years’ supervised release, plus $481,140 in restitution, for her role in a multi-state bank fraud conspiracy. Between November 2021 and April 2022, Husbands helped steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks in Mississippi, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas, pleading guilty to specifically withdrawing $108,000 from Regions Bank customer accounts in several Mississippi cities. Prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie, the case revealed that recruiters at homeless shelters and opioid-treatment clinics targeted Husbands—then homeless, addicted and in an abusive relationship—coercing her to create false IDs and execute fraudulent withdrawals for at least four victims. At her arrest in Mississippi, she was already jailed in Texas on related fraud, forgery and identity-theft charges. Husbands has expressed regret and still faces pending charges in other states."
13558,"Texas freshman Democratic Rep. Eddies Morales, whose district includes El Paso, Del Rio and Eagle Pass, told Fox 4’s Steven Dial that President Biden’s recent immigration measures haven’t done enough to help border states facing record migrant crossings. Citing Customs and Border Protection data showing this year’s encounters are only about 100,000 below last year’s 2,378,944 total, Morales proposed charging each migrant a $2,000 entry fee. He outlined a plan for U.S.–Mexico workforce agreements—e.g., bringing 100 crop pickers from Mexico to Uvalde under a joint governor-to-governor program—where migrants pay the fee, receive a non-voting RFID ID card that doubles as a credit card, and are legally employed. At 1,600 daily crossings in the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector, he said the fee would raise roughly $3.2 million per day, or over $1.2 billion per year, making it “a win-win situation for everyone.”"

After Cory’s unanimous eviction, Jag won HOH, nominated Blue Kim and America Lopez, then captured the POV again and says he won’t use it, keeping Blue squarely in his sights. Blue is scrambling for votes, but with only four ballots cast, Jag needs one more vote—Bowie Jane and Matt Klotz will back his plan, Cirie Fields is unlikely to, and Felicia Cannon probably will—to send Blue home. A live double eviction follows, and Jag can’t compete for the next HOH; he’s reliant on Matt winning to stay safe or risk going out immediately after Blue."

15619,"A suspected domestic kidnapping set off two related shootings in the Washington area late Thursday. Police say the suspect’s vehicle was first spotted outside the U.S. Census Bureau headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, where a guard who approached the car saw two people arguing and was shot in the upper body. Critically wounded, the guard remains hospitalized. The suspect fled, firing at multiple locations before crashing on Washington’s busy H Street and engaging in a shootout that left both an officer and the suspect wounded; both were conscious when taken from the scene. Authorities recovered the kidnapping victim unharmed."
15647,"California health officials have declared over after a measles outbreak—131 cases of the B3 strain plus five cases of a different genotype—sickened Californians since December. It has been 42 days (two incubation periods) since the last B3 case. Of 81 B3 patients whose vaccination status was known, 70% were unvaccinated. Prompt case investigations, contact tracing, vaccinating exposed individuals and boosting provider awareness halted the spread. The outbreak began among visitors to two Disney parks (42 cases Dec. 17–20); two April rash cases proved a different strain. Measles, a highly contagious respiratory disease transmitted by coughs or sneezes that can linger in air or on surfaces for up to two hours, causes fever, red eyes, runny nose, cough and rash and can lead to pneumonia or encephalitis."

The baby arrived more than a week past Jill’s self-set due dates—she’s training as a midwife and had prepared for a late birth. Jill and Derick were featured on the family’s June 21 wedding episode. Meanwhile, eldest Duggar son Josh is already father to three, and his wife Anna is due with their fourth child in July."
15777,"Most airline pilots pride themselves on keeping personal problems out of the cockpit—a highly structured environment of checklists and procedures—and stress is an accepted part of the job. When depression does occur, however, it is now treatable without ending a pilot’s career: the FAA approves certain prescribed medications so long as the condition is under control.  

The co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, Andreas Lubitz, evidently suffered psychiatric illness far more severe than routine depression. He received a series of medical injections and had publicly disclosed past depressive episodes, yet no one intervened. Red flags reportedly included his behavior among fellow glider pilots (where personality quirks become obvious), a competitive selection for Lufthansa’s ab initio training program in Arizona, a leave of absence during that intense, highly supervised phase, and final flight-specific schooling back in Germany. His peers and instructors should have noticed at least some signs.  

Adding to Lubitz’s burden were factors unique to Germanwings—Lufthansa’s low-cost subsidiary—such as lower pay, heavier schedules, and ongoing labor disputes over retirement benefits and working conditions. Together, these elements created what the author calls “a perfect storm” around a man already in crisis. The tragedy of Flight 9525, he concludes, might have been preventable—and serves as a reminder that accident investigations exist to ensure such failures are not repeated."
15782,"Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, of Columbus, Ohio, a naturalized U.S. citizen since February 2014, pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI. According to the indictment, he traveled to Syria in April 2014—buying a one-way ticket to Greece, diverting to Syria—for terrorist training in weapons, break-ins, explosives and hand-to-hand combat. Prosecutors allege he plotted to return to the U.S. to kill American soldiers execution-style—targeting military facilities, prisons and other uniformed personnel—and praised his brother’s death fighting for al-Nusra Front. He’s accused of receiving orders from a cleric to carry out a terrorist act on U.S. soil and was remanded into custody."
15784,"Sheriff Stanley Glanz announced that two deputies involved in the April 2 attempt to arrest Eric Harris in Tulsa have been reassigned after receiving unspecified threats to them and their families. They were on the scene when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot Harris—Bates, 73, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter, is free on $25,000 bond, and says he accidentally drew his handgun thinking it was a Taser after a brief foot chase. Although the two deputies aren’t facing charges, they’ve been criticized on video for pinning Harris’s head to the ground as he gasped “I’m losing my breath,” while another officer responds, “F--- your breath.” Glanz said he’s “very concerned” for their safety, has temporarily suspended the sheriff’s office drug unit pending review, and may wait until Bates’s trial concludes before deciding on any internal action. He denied allegations that Bates’s training records were forged, affirmed Bates’s qualifications, and noted that the FBI cleared the department of any civil-rights violations. Glanz has also brought in a Dallas police consultant to re-examine agency policies. Harris’s family, who has demanded justice and policy changes, says the shooting exposes “a deep-seated problem” within the department."

The victim, identified Monday as 26-year-old Jonathan Camilien—who knew Colina—was the same in both locations. Colina, already arraigned this week on assault and battery causing serious injury and improper disposal of a body, has had his bail revoked in a separate assault case. He is due for a murder arraignment on April 14. District Attorney Marian Ryan called the discovery “gruesome.”"

11365,"Since the Saudi-led coalition began air operations on March 26, more than 500 Houthi rebels have been killed, a Saudi Defense Ministry official told the state-run SPA. Gen. Ahmed Asiri said the nine-nation coalition has carried out about 1,200 airstrikes aimed at preventing Houthi advances toward southern Yemen. On Friday near the Saudi–Yemeni border in Najran, Houthi mortar rounds killed three Saudi officers and wounded two others. Yemen’s Health Ministry reported 385 civilian deaths and 342 injuries, while the WHO’s higher figures—648 killed and 2,191 wounded—include militant casualties. Yemen has fallen into deeper chaos since Houthi rebels ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi in January, and even before the Saudi campaign most of the country’s 25 million people needed humanitarian assistance."
11396,"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn of the Diocese of Kansas City–St. Joseph, Missouri. Finn was convicted in 2012 of failing to report suspected child abuse involving priest Shawn Ratigan, who pleaded guilty that year to child pornography charges. Tried by a judge to protect victims’ anonymity, Finn was found guilty on one count, sentenced to two years’ probation, ordered to establish a $10,000 counseling fund and mandate abuse-reporting training, but paid no fine and served no jail time. He remained in office until this week, despite criticism—including from Cardinal Sean O’Malley—that a convicted bishop should not lead a diocese. Notre Dame professor Candida Moss and advocates say the delay in removing him raises questions, though the timing may help restore confidence in Francis after controversy over a Chilean bishop’s appointment. Until a new bishop is named, Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann will serve as apostolic administrator. Watchdog Anne Doyle calls Finn’s removal “just the beginning,” urging the pope to publicly affirm that bishops who fail to prioritize children’s safety will be held accountable."
11416,"Tristan da Cunha, a UK overseas territory in the South Atlantic with just under 270 residents and only seven family names, is the world’s most isolated settlement. Working with the Royal Institute of British Architects, its administration has launched an international design competition to modernize its aging infrastructure and boost self-sufficiency ahead of its 200th anniversary in 2016. Entrants—especially those experienced in renewable energy in remote areas, modern housing and cost-effective agriculture—must propose energy-efficient upgrades to the island’s bungalow-style buildings (made of concrete and volcanic rock), plans for renewable power, and practical logistics for shipping materials during the 60-day shipping season. Tristan da Cunha comprises four islands (only Tristan is inhabited; Gough and Inaccessible are UNESCO sites), lies seven days by sea from Cape Town, and already supports basic amenities, a small school, medical staff, lobster fishing exports, stamps, coins, handicrafts and modest tourism. Having just completed new water, electrical and wastewater systems, the island now seeks designs that reduce fossil-fuel dependence, lower import costs and strengthen community facilities. Submissions are due mid-June; finalists will be selected by September and the winner announced in June 2016, with funding sought from UK and possibly EU grants."

2. Hillary Clinton has leased a Brooklyn campaign HQ and will officially launch soon, reintroducing herself with biographical themes (her Chicago upbringing, early children’s-advocacy work, Arkansas years) and unveiling a larger-than-expected, experienced staff through smaller, personal events.  
3. Sen. Robert Menendez’s corruption indictment, beyond the lurid luxury-hotel details, alleges his staff solicited super-PAC contributions in violation of campaign-finance laws, a practice watchdogs warn could draw wider FEC scrutiny.

Tapper, who joined CNN from ABC in 2013 after earning praise as interim anchor of ABC’s This Week in 2010, succeeds Candy Crowley, with rotating hosts filling the slot since Crowley’s December departure. CNN CEO Jeff Zucker praised Tapper’s reporting, storytelling and interviewing skills. The move, coming amid anchor changes at CBS’s Face the Nation and NBC’s Meet the Press, could prompt viewers to sample CNN’s refreshed Sunday lineup. Tapper will join the small group of hosts—like ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and formerly CNN’s Wolf Blitzer—who handle both weekday and Sunday duties."

11800,"Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old American aid worker and former USAID contractor from Rockville, Maryland, was abducted in Lahore in 2011 by gunmen posing as neighbors. Within months, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri claimed him as a hostage, demanding the U.S. halt airstrikes in Pakistan. Over the next three-and-a-half years, Weinstein’s family and some U.S. officials pressed for his release—at times buoyed by al Qaeda’s 2013 Christmas video of a frail Weinstein and by a 2014 prisoner swap that freed Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. No deal materialized.  

In January 2015, Weinstein and Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto were unintentionally killed in a U.S. drone strike on an al Qaeda compound along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border; U.S. authorities had been unaware hostages were present. President Obama and former colleagues praised Weinstein’s lifelong service—as a Peace Corps volunteer, college professor, World Bank and USAID consultant—and his dedication to Pakistan’s people and culture.  

In a public statement, his wife Elaine thanked Maryland lawmakers and the FBI for “relentless” efforts but criticized other U.S. and Pakistani officials for inconsistent support. She called on both governments to adopt a coordinated approach to hostage cases and condemned Weinstein’s captors, insisting they alone are responsible for his death."
11803,"South Korea’s Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo offered to resign amid a widening bribery scandal triggered by the apparent suicide of tycoon Sung Woan-jong, who left a note listing cash payments to top officials, including those tied to President Park Geun-hye. Lee has handed over Cabinet meeting duties to the deputy prime minister but remains in office until Park accepts his resignation. A special prosecutor’s team is investigating Lee and seven other politicians linked to the president. Lee denies any wrongdoing, while Park—currently on a trip to Central and South America—has condemned corruption, vowed political reform, and warned she will not forgive those responsible. Park is due back in South Korea on April 27."
11871,"Corinthian Colleges Inc., long criticized as one of the worst “predator” for-profit colleges—offering dubious degrees, loading students with debt, and relying on federal aid for 86% of its revenue—announced it is closing its final 28 campuses. At its peak Corinthian enrolled over 70,000 students; now hundreds of its graduates are on a “debt strike,” and the Education Department has signaled it will forgive their loans. For-profit colleges enroll 13% of U.S. students but account for nearly half of all loan defaults, and graduates often earn less than high-school dropouts despite paying roughly 60% more than public colleges. Investigations have documented aggressive recruiting tactics, fake credentials, cheating, and misleading job-placement claims; in 2013 Career Education Corp. alone paid $10 million to New York over false placement data, and 36 state attorneys general were probing the sector in 2014. Corinthian’s collapse, along with a 50% enrollment drop at University of Phoenix, underscores a broader call: shut down remaining predatory for-profit schools, forgive debts of students who aren’t employed or can’t transfer within three years, and protect the integrity of the college degree.

11884,"Kabul today is dramatically larger in population but far diminished in international activity, its streets bearing the uneasy legacy of America’s longest war.  Outside a mosque, five former NATO‐affiliated English-speakers report they were abruptly fired, blacklisted and left homeless—sleeping in market stalls, separated from fearful families and trapped by threats of reprisal.  Districts once dominated by foreign “poppy palaces,” Chicken Street bazaars and contractor-filled restaurants now lie empty, driven into silence by embassy security warnings and a vanishing expatriate community.  Along the highways east of the city, massive excavators, cherry-pickers and supply trucks—bought for U.S. military projects and sustained by 120,000 troops—sit idle; their owners or commanding patrons have decamped to Dubai, leaving drivers with vehicles they can neither afford to run nor sell for their purchase price.  Yet wedding palaces multiply at night, their lavish lighting powered by diesel generators that NATO installed at great cost but rarely used—an ostentatious statement of local optimism even as the last U.S. troops prepare to retreat inside the embassy by next year, and residents wonder how long Kabul’s lights will keep burning."
11885,"A recent Consumer Reports analysis of 70 million U.S. domestic trips shows wide variation in award-seat availability among the five largest carriers. Southwest Airlines led the pack with 11.9 million award seats—11.5% of its 103.1 million total seats—thanks to its “Every Seat is an Award Seat” policy, no blackout dates, non-expiring points, broad network and no close-in or cancellation fees. Delta ranked second with 5.6 million award seats, United third with 5 million and American fourth with 3.5 million. JetBlue trailed with just 892,000 award seats (4.5% of 19.7 million seats), partly because it serves only 10 of the top 25 markets and many customers earn too few miles to redeem often; it has since eliminated mileage expiration. Although nearly 10% of passengers on these carriers fly on award tickets, Consumer Reports warns that redeeming miles on low-fare routes—such as LAX–SFO, where cash fares run about \$100—yields poor value (12,500–30,000 miles), and recommends using miles on higher-fare routes like AA’s NYC–SFO or Delta’s Chicago–L.A. Overall customer satisfaction scores were Southwest 86, JetBlue 85, Delta 70, American 66 and United 63. Unlike Southwest, the other airlines impose fees for checked bags, phone bookings, changes and more."
11890,"In June 2012, James Holmes, a 27-year-old former neuroscience Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, opened fire on a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 and wounding 70. Dressed in body armor, carrying multiple firearms and a gas mask, Holmes resembled the Joker and had booby-trapped his apartment with explosives, which were defused after his arrest in the theater parking lot. He admits the shootings but pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming a “psychotic episode,” while prosecutors seek the death penalty. Jury selection, one of the nation’s largest with 9,000 summonses, produced a 12-member, mostly white, middle-aged panel plus 12 alternates; opening statements are set to begin Monday and the trial may run into autumn, covering 165 counts. Holmes’s defense points to severe mental illness; prosecutors counter that campus psychiatrists warned he was dangerous after he made threats in early June 2012 and was barred from the university when he dropped out. A victims’ group, No Notoriety, is urging media to stop publicizing mass-killer images. Holmes’s family—his father a mathematician, his mother a nurse, and a younger musician sister—has asked the court, if he’s found not guilty by reason of insanity, to spare his life and confine him to a psychiatric institution, arguing he “is not a monster” but “a human being gripped by severe mental illness.”"
11891,"Prosperity-gospel pastor Creflo Dollar has defended his appeal for donations to purchase a $65 million Gulfstream G650 jet, telling congregants in a recent YouTube clip that “the devil” is trying to discredit him over the campaign. Dollar—who originally asked global supporters to give $300 each to replace his 1984 Gulfstream after two accidents, including a London runway skid—insists he never directly asked his World Changers Church attendees for money. Critics have questioned why a preacher needs such a luxurious aircraft (it carries 18 passengers and four crew, has Rolls-Royce engines, high-speed Internet and a transcontinental range), and social media and news outlets widely covered the fundraising video, now removed from his ministry’s site (donations remain open via the church’s gift page). Dollar says his 3 million worldwide followers want him to travel to them safely, and that the jet’s advanced features justify the purchase. Attempts to reach his ministry for further comment were unsuccessful. CNN’s Steve Almasy contributed to this report."
