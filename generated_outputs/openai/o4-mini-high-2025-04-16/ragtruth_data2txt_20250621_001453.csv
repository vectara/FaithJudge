Across  three customer reviews, the business holds an average rating of 3.5 stars.

15020,"The Lark is a New American cocktail bar and restaurant located at 131 Anacapa Street, Ste A in Santa Barbara’s Funk Zone. Open Tuesday through Sunday from 5:00 PM (closing between 9:00 PM and 10:00 PM) and closed on Mondays, it offers an upscale, trendy atmosphere with free street parking, outdoor seating by a fireplace and portable heaters, and free Wi-Fi. Reservations are accepted, and the space accommodates groups but does not offer take-out or valet service.

On the menu are shareable dishes such as Crispy Brussels Sprouts, Winter Beets & Marinated Burrata, Caramelized Cauliflower, Cast Iron Morro Bay Black Cod, Creekstone Prime Hanger Steak and Buttermilk Fried Chicken, along with smaller items like a mushroom tartine and seasoned popcorn. The beverage selection includes wine by the glass (for example, Grimm’s Bluff Happy Canyon Rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon) and classic cocktails including gimlets and Black Manhattans.

Across three recent reviews (average rating 4 stars), diners praised the food’s quality, the thoughtful service and personalized touches—such as anniversary cards, complimentary pours and attentive servers like Laurel and Oscar—and the cozy outdoor setup. One reviewer cited inconsistent service when the restaurant was lightly attended, noting delays in clearing dishes and inattentive staff."
15025,"Cafe del Sol is a casual American-and-Mexican restaurant located at 30 Los Patos Way in Santa Barbara, CA. With a 3.5-star overall rating, it offers American (Traditional and New) and Mexican dishes, outdoor seating, group-friendly accommodations, takeout, reservations and street or lot parking. Wi-Fi is not available, and it does not offer valet or garage parking.

Patrons consistently praise its friendly staff (including owner Alfredo) and well-stocked bar with standout margaritas and a varied drink menu—though one reviewer noted the liquor license was briefly suspended, leaving the bar unusually empty. The salsa and free happy-hour appetizers draw a crowd, and chips are frequently mentioned as a solid starter. Food opinions are mixed: chicken enchiladas and tostadas earn compliments for freshness and portion size, while entrées such as chicken piccata and certain $16 dishes have been called pricey relative to their quality. Overall, Café del Sol is recommended for casual drinks, happy-hour specials and relaxed gatherings rather than fine-dining value."
