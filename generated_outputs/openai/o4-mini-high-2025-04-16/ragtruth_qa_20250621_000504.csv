1. Hourly wage (with overtime where applicable)  
2. Flat-rate or “flag-rate” pay (a set amount per job)  
3. Commission (typically based on parts sold or labor billed)  

Many shops blend an hourly rate with commissions or use flat-rate/commission only. Actual rates vary by state, employer and industry, but nationwide averages range roughly from $20–$32 per hour (about $49,000–$66,000 per year)."
14323,"Here’s how to set up your grill for a porterhouse based on the provided steps:

1. Charcoal grill  
   • Dump a chimney of lit coals into the grill.  
   • Using a hoe, spread the coals into three zones:  
     – Far side: double layer (highest heat)  
     – Center: single layer (medium heat)  
     – Closest to you: coal-free (indirect/cool zone)

1. Education  
  – India’s trends are “much more typical,” with an early focus on expanding access: building schools, training teachers and providing resources to get children into school.  
  – Vietnam’s system is “relatively equitable,” so poorer and better-off children receive essentially the same support once enrolled.

2. Colonial legacy  
  – India was Britain’s largest colony until 1947, then partitioned along Hindu, Muslim and Sikh lines, leading to conflict.  
  – Vietnam was France’s largest Indochinese colony until 1945 and did not undergo a similar religious partition."

3. Prepare your grid  
   – Use graph paper or draw neat x- and y-axes.  
   – On the x-axis list your categories.  
   – On the y-axis set a scale high enough to include your largest value.

4. Title and label  
   – Give your graph a clear title.  
   – Label each axis (e.g. “Month” on x, “Inches of Rainfall” on y).

5. Draw your bars  
   – For each category, draw a rectangular bar whose height matches its value on the y-axis.  
   – Make sure bar heights are proportional to the data.

6. Add finishing touches  
   – Color or shade your bars for visual impact.  
   – Double-check scales so that extreme values don’t distort your comparison."

4. Watering and maintenance  
   – Water established plants thoroughly and deeply about once a week.  
   – To encourage large blooms, pinch off all side buds at the ends of branches throughout the season.  

5. Overwintering  
   – Lift tubers or leave them in pots stored in a garage that stays above freezing (but not too cold).
