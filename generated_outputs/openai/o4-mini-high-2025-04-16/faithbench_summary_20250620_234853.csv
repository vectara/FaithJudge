14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades blew up the gate of Kabul’s 400-bed Sardar Daud hospital at 09:00 local time, then shot staff and patients—wounding more than 50—until Afghan commandos landed on the roof and, after six hours of fighting, killed all four attackers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, its first direct clash with security forces in the capital, while the Taliban denied involvement. President Ashraf Ghani and de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah condemned the assault, calling hospitals immune sites. Witnesses described an attacker in a white coat firing a Kalashnikov. IS’s use of a gate-blasting, commando-style assault suggests it has acquired new resources and training in Afghanistan, where it declared its “Khorasan Province” in 2015 and has since carried out several high-casualty bombings in Kabul. Government forces say they have cleared IS from some eastern bases but not from mountainous areas. The IS-linked Amaq news agency posted images of militants and casualties on Telegram. Meanwhile, the Taliban have also stepped up attacks, including suicide bombings in Kabul last week."
14-1,"Mukherjee’s The Lives Of Others (a 1967 Calcutta family drama) is a 5/2 favorite to win this year’s Booker Prize, the 46th award and the first open to any author writing in English. The winner will be announced Tuesday at London’s Guildhall. The six-strong shortlist—Howard Jacobson (J), Ali Smith (How to Be Both), Joshua Ferris (To Rise Again at a Decent Hour), Karen Joy Fowler (We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves), Richard Flanagan (The Narrow Road to the Deep North) and Mukherjee—comprises three British writers, two Americans and an Australian. Fowler’s novel tops sales at over 55,000 copies; Ferris has sold about 6,000, and Mukherjee’s weekly sales jumped from 97 to 507 after the shortlist was revealed. Critics have called it a “weak list,” reigniting debates over literary merit versus readability. The judges, chaired by AC Grayling, include Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Last year’s prize went to Eleanor Catton’s The Luminaries. Shortlisted authors each receive £2,500 and a specially bound edition; the ceremony, hosted by the Duchess of Cornwall, will be broadcast on BBC News Channel and BBC Arts from 21:30 BST."
14-2,"After weeks of speculation over whether Mark Carney would extend his term as Governor of the Bank of England until 2021 or leave as planned in 2018, he announced a compromise: a one-year extension to mid-2019. Observers had wondered if political pressure or disillusionment with Brexit’s economic outlook lay behind any decision, but Carney made clear—most recently to the Lords’ economic affairs committee—that the extra year was driven by personal and family considerations. With two daughters facing A-levels and GCSEs in 2018, he felt it was “the perfect moment” to return to Canada’s education system once those exams were completed. While Theresa May supported whichever choice he made and dismissed any government pressure, Carney’s one-year extension will see him through the Article 50 negotiations before a successor takes over."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, a much-loved Sunday Times columnist since 1993, died suddenly after describing himself as diagnosed with the “full English” of cancers. His final column, about coming to terms with that diagnosis, appears in tomorrow’s paper. Editor Martin Ivens called him “the heart and soul” of the paper and “a giant among journalists,” and peers from Jay Rayner to Piers Morgan paid tribute to his wit, courage and flair.  

Gill was as famous for his dazzling, fearless prose as he was for sparking outrage—whether recounting shooting a baboon in Tanzania or insulting the Welsh, Rhyl, Norfolk, the Isle of Man and TV presenter Clare Balding. Born in Edinburgh in 1954, he overcame dyslexia by dictating copy, studied art in London, began as an art reviewer in the 1980s, wrote for Tatler and then the Sunday Times.  

His personal life included marriages to Cressida Connolly (1983) and Amber Rudd (1991; two children), and a long partnership with Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins and to whom he became engaged shortly before his death."
14-4,"The passage describes three prominent “virtual warrior” groups operating around the Russia–Ukraine conflict.  
1. Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev programmer Yevhen Dokukin, claim responsibility for hacking Russian interior-ministry servers and a Rostov-region police email account, data from which volunteer group Inform Napalm says prove the evacuation of wounded Russian servicemen from Ukraine.  They rely heavily on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to knock rebel websites offline, target separatist funding accounts (e.g. PayPal, WebMoney), hijack public CCTV to monitor troop movements, and in December even commandeered network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to spit out pro-Ukrainian messages.  Ukrainian officials deny using hacker-provided intelligence to direct artillery fire.  
2. Cyber Berkut takes an anti-Western line, styling itself on the riot police who crushed Kiev protesters in 2014.  Its stated aim is to halt Ukraine’s military operations, which it dubs “genocide” instigated by the US.  During US vice-president Joe Biden’s November visit, it defaced Ukrainian government sites with anti-Biden slogans and claims to have stolen confidential US assistance documents from a team member’s mobile device.  It has also hacked Kiev billboards with graphic “war criminal” imagery, allegedly disrupted electronic vote-counting in October’s parliamentary election, leaked defence-ministry casualty data, blocked President Poroshenko’s website, and—in an unverified claim—published a hacked Facebook chat suggesting Ukrainian forces downed flight MH17.  
3. Anonymous International (also called b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay) is best known for leaking Kremlin documents.  It’s unclear whether it hacks or relies on insider sources.  Mostly focused on Russian domestic politics, it has also released material relating to Ukraine—such as a November letter from a Russian fighter disparaging local support for separatists and May email exchanges involving former FSB colonel Igor Girkin.  Its website is currently blocked in Russia."
5-0,"Milner, the 30-year-old former Manchester City midfielder, earned 61 England caps after debuting in 2009. He was part of two World Cup squads and two European Championship squads—playing just three minutes at Euro 2016—before announcing his departure as “about common sense,” and wishing Sam Allardyce, his teammates, staff and supporters well. He also holds the record for most England Under-21 appearances (46 caps since 2004) and scored his only senior international goal in a 5-0 World Cup qualifying win over Moldova in 2014."
5-1,"Brad Wilk is an American drummer best known for his work with Rage Against the Machine (1991–2000; 2007–11) and Audioslave (2001–07).

15-0,"Veteran actor Robert Hardy, 89, is selling over 200 antiques from his lifelong military-history collection in a £100,000 auction this Saturday at Dominic Winter in South Cerney, Gloucestershire, as he downsizes his Cotswolds home. Highlights include a pair of early Victorian Gillows cabinets (est. up to £4,000), a 1960s hand-painted limewood diorama of the Battle of Agincourt (£4,000–£6,000), a yew longbow with mother-of-pearl handle (up to £2,000) and a portrait of Hardy holding it. Other lots range from swords, flintlock rifles and crystal chandeliers to paintings—among them an early 20th-century scene of Alfred the Great by Frank Owen Salisbury—and books dating back to the 17th century. Hardy, famed for playing Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small and Winston Churchill on screen (as well as Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter films), studied English under J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis at Oxford, has published two books on the longbow, and advised on the Mary Rose shipwreck. Though saddened to part with his “treasured library,” he says entrusting the sale to Dominic Winter has eased the pain; he retired from the stage after a fall but remains active in television."

15-3,"From 2005 to 2012, U.S. heavy drinking rose 17.2 percent and binge-drinking also climbed, driven largely by women.  Heavy drinking is defined as averaging over one drink per day for women (two for men); binge-drinking is four (women) or five (men) drinks on one occasion at least once a month.  By 2012, 8 percent of adults were heavy drinkers and 18 percent binge-drinkers.  Nationwide, women’s binge rates increased over seven times those of men (in Santa Clara County, women’s binge-drinking rose 36 percent vs. 23 percent for men).  County extremes in 2012 ranged from a 6 percent binge rate in Madison County, Idaho, to 36 percent in Menominee, Wisconsin; heavy-drinking rates ran from 2 percent in Hancock County, Tennessee, to 22 percent in Esmeralda County, Nevada.  In 2010, alcohol was linked to about 88,600 U.S. deaths and over \$220 billion in costs.  Researchers point to shifting social norms (especially for women), higher consumption by young and affluent drinkers, cheaper alcohol in real terms, increased advertising (\$3.45 billion in 2011), and looser sales policies.  The findings—based on 3.7 million adults surveyed by the CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System—are the first to map adult drinking patterns at the county level."
4-0,"The Giants opened the scoring short-handed through player-coach Derrick Walser, but Jeff Dimmen levelled for the Panthers. In the second period Mike Forney converted a power-play breakaway to make it 2-1, only for Andy Bohmback to equalise again. Mike Radja and James Desmarais then put the Panthers 4-2 ahead before Nottingham’s David Ling added a late reply. The sides meet again Saturday in the second game of their double-header. Nottingham top the league with 28 points, followed by the Sheffield Steelers on 27 and Belfast on 25."

Excuse My French is both the debut studio album by rapper French Montana and the title of a 2014 Egyptian comedy film directed by Amr Salama. The film, drawn from Salama’s own middle-school experiences after returning to Egypt from Saudi Arabia, faced censorship for its sensitive portrayal of religious discrimination and was revised to retain its central message."

Striker Ruairi Keating, 21, recommended to boss Kevin Nicholson by Micky Adams, arrives pending international clearance after spells with Sligo Rovers, Galway United and Finn Harps. Nicholson praised Anderson’s leadership and Keating’s hunger. Torquay sit four points above the relegation zone, having won just one of their last six games."
9-0,"The passage describes two historical figures named Francis I:

1. Francis I (Franz Stefan, François Étienne; 1708–1765) served as Holy Roman Emperor and Grand Duke of Tuscany, though real authority in those roles was exercised by his wife.  
2. Francis I of France (François Ier; 1494–1547) was the first Valois–Angoulême king, reigning from 1515. Nicknamed “Francis of the Large Nose,” “Grand Colas” and the “Knight-King” for personally leading wars against his rival Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain), he ultimately failed to secure victory. He then formed a controversial Franco-Ottoman alliance with Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and fought Charles V again in the Italian War of 1536–1538."
9-1,"During Sunday’s inaugural IndyCar Grand Prix of Louisiana in Avondale, Dayle Coyne Racing’s front-outside tire changer, Todd Phillips, was struck in the leg by Francesco Dracone’s car as Dracone exited his pit box on lap 25 for tires and fuel. Phillips received stitches at the infield care center and has been released. Rain-softened track conditions left many drivers struggling for traction. Dracone, 19, of Italy, spun on turn one, failed to finish and was classified 23rd."
9-2,"Widnes held off a late Castleford fightback to win 38–24. At half-time the Vikings led 14–6 thanks to Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van and Chris Bridge tries (Paddy Flynn scoring Castleford’s). Early in the second half Flynn reduced the gap, but Widnes ran in four more through Ah Van, Lloyd White (2) and Joe Mellor to go 38–12 ahead. Castleford then crossed three times in four minutes—Larne Patrick, Luke Gale and Flynn (his hat-trick try)—but couldn’t complete the comeback. Mellor’s break from a short kick-off had put Widnes 26 clear and sealed their first win after nine losses in ten. The result lifted Widnes above Wakefield into seventh, while Castleford stayed sixth, one point above the Vikings. Referee: J Smith."
9-3,"The 30-year-old striker rejoined St Mirren in July for a second spell and is in contention to make his debut against Alloa this Saturday. After scoring nine goals for Dundee last season, he’s mostly been used off the bench so far but insists he’s never been fitter, keeping sharp with under-20s games and intensive training. Capped twice by Scotland in 2008 (one goal), he has nearly 400 senior club appearances to his name, including spells at Bristol City, Brentford and Bristol Rovers. St Mirren lie eighth in the Championship, seven points above Alloa, and he hopes a victory will kick-start a run up the table."
9-4,"Bolton-born boxer Amir Khan, 28, spent a family day at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Northern California with his wife Faryal Makhdoom Khan and daughter Lamysa. There he fed a rare white tiger and posed with giraffes and sea lions. Earlier in the week he announced his next fight: a welterweight bout against former light-welterweight champion Chris Algieri on May 30, putting to rest rumors of matches with Kell Brook, Adrien Broner or Keith Thurman."
16-0,"The passage opens by calling Mayweather vs. Pacquiao the century’s most financially and culturally significant boxing match and notes its place as the sixth in a 12-fight series that shaped the sport’s history. It then revisits the Sugar Ray Leonard–Roberto Durán trilogy from boxing’s “golden age.” After Leonard claimed the welterweight title by beating Félix Trinidad, he lost a hotly disputed decision to Durán in Montreal. Eight months later, in New Orleans, Leonard abandoned his first fight’s slug-fest strategy and used superior speed and movement; Durán, frustrated and stunned by repeated jabs, quit in the eighth round, famously telling the referee “no mas.” The defeat damaged Durán’s reputation at home until he rebuilt it by knocking out Davey Moore in 1983 to win the light-middleweight crown. Leonard closed out their rivalry with a lopsided decision in 1989 and later said forcing Durán to quit was more satisfying than scoring a knockout."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy, the world number one, insists it’s “unthinkable” that he won’t one day win the Masters and complete golf’s career Grand Slam, joining Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. Reflecting on his final-round collapse at Augusta in 2011—when a four-shot lead turned into a closing 80 and a 10-shot defeat—he calls that “the most important day” of his career. Two months later he won the U.S. Open by eight shots, and has since added the 2012 U.S. PGA and both the Open and PGA titles in 2014. In six Masters starts he has just one top-10 (joint eighth in 2013) and will tee off at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on March 19 before returning to Augusta later this month. Despite personal distractions last year—calling off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki and a costly legal dispute—McIlroy says the golf course has become his “sanctuary,” and he believes he can not only win his first green jacket but multiple ones over his career."
16-2,"Spanish cyclist Pablo Mandado (27) and Latvian Ilze Zebolde (31) gave up their restaurant jobs in Manchester to embark on an open-ended, pedal-powered tour of the world, starting from London in 2011.

Traveling on less than €3 per person per day (about €0.10 per km), they keep costs minimal by camping (161 nights), using Couchsurfing (66) and Warmshowers (44), and relying on the hospitality of strangers. Their only major expense is food—€2.74 daily per person—comprised of staples like pasta, bread, rice, eggs, milk and seasonal produce, supplemented by wild foraging, invited meals and even dumpster diving. Carrying 130 kg of gear, they wash “sometimes daily, sometimes weekly” and pause whenever a view—or tunnel—beckons. Their next goals are to press into Asia, cross the Pacific and cycle the entire length of the Americas, planning to remain on the road for years."
16-3,"Spanish cyclist Pablo Mandado (27) and Latvian Ilze Zebolde (31) quit their Manchester restaurant jobs to cycle around the world “a pedal at a time,” with no fixed route or schedule.

16-4,"A three-bedroom, 1,990 sq ft maisonette on exclusive Egerton Place in Knightsbridge has been listed at £575,000—roughly the annual rental rate—because it has only three years left on its lease. The unmodernised property (three bedrooms, two bathrooms, reception room, utility room, lift, parking and communal garden) would fetch about £15,000 a month to rent but could be worth over £6 million once the lease is extended. A second, larger flat on the same street is on the market for £595,000 with the same short lease; the next cheapest Knightsbridge three-bedroom home starts at £1.5 million on a 28-year lease. Extending to a 90-year lease through the freeholder (the Wellcome Trust) is estimated to cost £3.35–4.5 million. Agents describe the rare opportunity as attracting strong interest—especially from developers—but warn buyers of the “massive premium” required for a lease extension. Egerton Place dates from 1893, was built by John Grover & Son to Mervyn Macartney’s designs, and has historically housed high-status residents."

Arbroath, relegated to League Two after finishing bottom of League One in 2013-14, agreed to let Sheerin go after Aberdeen’s chief executive, Duncan Fraser, described McInnes’s choice as the result of “a comprehensive process” and praised Arbroath chairman John Christison’s cooperation. As a player, Sheerin featured for several Scottish clubs, spent time at Östersunds in Sweden and won a Scotland Under-21 cap in the mid-1990s. He led Arbroath to their first national trophy— the Scottish Third Division title and promotion in 2011."

11-1,"Seventy-five-year-old Jack Nicklaus aced the 130-yard fourth hole during Augusta National’s Par-3 Contest, his first hole-in-one ever on the tournament course. Playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw, he watched his shot fly past the flag before spinning back into the cup, prompting cheers, a fist pump and an on-course interview in which he quipped that all he had to do was “win the Par-3 and make a hole in one.” Although five aces were recorded that day—tying the contest record—Camilo Villegas notched two but lost a playoff to world No. 74 Kevin Streelman for the title. Nicklaus, the youngest Masters champion in 1963 and six-time green-jacket winner by 1986, remains one of only five men to complete golf’s career grand slam."
11-3,"Researchers in Western Australia have recovered the 5.68 m carcass of a juvenile female Omura’s whale—previously feared extinct—washed ashore on Exmouth Beach after Cyclone Olwyn. This marks the first record of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff initially struggled to identify it, confirming its identity through DNA profiling. Described only in 2003 and known from tropical and subtropical waters of Indonesia, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan, the species is poorly understood. Its sleek body and distinctive skeleton (numerous vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin) will be studied once the skeleton is exhumed for research and potential museum display."
11-4,"A juvenile female Omura’s whale (5.68 m) washed ashore on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Cyclone Olwyn – the first WA sighting and only the second in Australia of a species once feared extinct. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff, initially unable to identify the rare whale, confirmed it by DNA profiling. Described only in 2003 and thought confined to tropical and subtropical waters (Indonesian seas, the Philippines, Sea of Japan), Omura’s whales have a sleek body and distinctive skeletal traits, including an unusual number of vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the discovery “highly significant,” noting that studying the buried carcass and its future-recovered skeleton will improve identification guides and knowledge of the whale’s distribution."

10-0,"• In Moscow on Friday, investigators opened the Su-24’s “black box” before journalists and diplomats; some flight data appear missing. An analysis of its contents, which could settle where the jet was hit, is due next week.  
• The 24 November downing by Turkish F-16s has sparked a Russia–Turkey crisis: Turkey asserts the Russian jet ignored airspace warnings, while Russia insists it was shot down over Syria. President Putin has accused Turkey of subservience to the US and “creeping Islamisation.”  
• Both nations, though officially opposed to IS, back opposing sides in Syria. After the shoot-down, both Su-24 crew ejected; the navigator survived, but the pilot was killed—reportedly by ground militants. A Russian marine sent to assist also died and a rescue helicopter was destroyed.  
• In retaliation, Russia has demanded a Turkish apology and imposed sanctions—among them a ban on package holidays to Turkey, a measure projected to cost Turkey billions of dollars."
10-2,"An oil leak at an oil storage site in the Zhangzhou paraxylene (PX) plant in Fujian province sparked a fire and explosion Monday night, injuring six people (five by broken glass) who have been hospitalized. Local media reported no toxic chemical spill. Over 600 firefighters brought the blaze under control by Tuesday morning, and nearby residents—some of whom felt tremors—posted photos on Weibo. The plant, which produces the carcinogenic PX used in polyester films and fabrics, previously experienced a noninjury explosion in July 2013. Originally planned for densely populated Xiamen, the facility was moved to its current remote location in 2007 after pollution-related protests."
10-3,"In autumn 2004, a 15-year-old girl met a man known then as David Ayrton in a Portsmouth garage. She later accused him of raping her there while two friends slept; she had drunk about one and a half cans of Foster’s but clearly remembered shouting and swearing at her attacker. Ayrton, now 34 and calling herself Davina, denied the charge at Portsmouth Crown Court. The court heard she has learning difficulties, attempted suicide last summer, changed her name in 2012, and has not taken any medication or made physical changes related to her gender. In 2014 Ayrton told a worker at her care home in Fordingbridge about the attack. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody—likely a male prison in Winchester—citing risks to her safety and flight, and set sentencing for 4 March. Protocols have been arranged for her detention."
10-4,"Eugene, Oregon, has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships after the IAAF Council chose to waive the usual bidding process, calling it a “unique strategic opportunity” to stage the event in the USA for the first time. Eugene had failed in its 2019 bid—won by Doha’s Aspire Dome—but convinced the IAAF with a recent presentation of its hosting capabilities. IAAF President Lamine Diack said the decision united public authorities, the private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC and an enthusiastic local public, and was taken in the interest of global development and access to a key market. The 2007 championships in Osaka were likewise awarded without bidding. Mo Farah won the men’s 10,000 m gold at the 2016 IAAF World Athletics Championships in Moscow."
13-0,"Lieutenant Bombardier Ben Parkinson, who was seriously injured by a bomb in Afghanistan in 2006, carried the Olympic torch on 26 June—walking nearly half an hour with an assistant’s support amid cheering crowds. Although his brain injury initially robbed him of speech, he now talks unaided, spends 12 hours a day on gym work and rehabilitation, walks with crutches and raises funds for military charities as patron of the Pilgrim Bandits. Since his torch run he has received over 5,000 Facebook friend requests—the site’s personal‐profile limit—seen 19,000 views on a single update and attracted thousands to the Pilgrim Bandits website. His mother, Diane, described the outpouring of support as “phenomenal,” and Facebook has advised he create a public page or enable subscriber updates. The torch relay will cover 8,000 miles in 70 days before reaching London for the opening ceremony on 27 July."
13-1,"Demelza Poldark goes from barely showing to giving birth to her and Ross Poldark’s baby daughter within ten minutes of tomorrow night’s episode. Although Ross (Aidan Turner) initially married his red-headed kitchen maid out of duty, he tells her she makes him a better man, leaving no doubt of his love. Viewers have pointed out that the series skips from announcing Demelza’s pregnancy to her being eight months along—and then to delivery—almost instantaneously. Fans on Twitter have mocked this, noting it mirrors a previous storyline where Elizabeth’s pregnancy also leapt from news to full term between episodes."
13-2,"New health-service data show that 272 children disabled by foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were hospitalised in England over the past year, though experts warn many more go undiagnosed. World Health Organization research cited by the Sunday People estimates that at least 1 in 100 UK babies—around 7,500 annually—suffer learning, behavioural and physical problems (including deformed limbs) after in-womb alcohol exposure. Elizabeth Mitchell of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome calls it “enormous” and “vastly under-diagnosed,” noting that affected children do not improve over time.  
A high-profile case is 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who needs full support and will never live independently; her adoptive parents founded the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust in 2007. Other alcohol-related birth conditions include liver, kidney and heart damage, cerebral palsy, sight loss and epilepsy. Current UK guidance allows up to two units twice a week, but Mitchell argues for advice that pregnant women abstain entirely."
13-3,"Scotland’s women’s team have won all five UEFA qualifying matches so far and face Iceland at Falkirk Stadium on Friday—victory would put them almost guaranteed into next summer’s European Championship in the Netherlands. Captain Rachel Evans, who’s twice seen qualification slip away in play-off defeats, warned another failure would be “devastating.” Iceland (world No. 20) are also unbeaten, and the two fixtures between them will likely decide who tops the group. Even as one of the two best runners-up, Scotland could still qualify automatically.  

Twelve of the current 20-player squad play abroad—five in England, four in Sweden and two in the U.S. NWSL (including BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year Kim Little). Evans, a Bayern Munich forward who just won the Frauen-Bundesliga, says daily competition at top clubs and exposure to different playing styles are strengthening the national team as it chases its first major-tournament finals."
13-4,"A light Aerostar aircraft on approach to the Aero Acres residential airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida, landed without its landing gear deployed, skidding along the runway belly-first as its propellers ricocheted off the tarmac. A bystander’s video records the bump, the wings bouncing, and the sound of the damaged prop tips. Realizing the mistake, the pilot throttled up, the engines held despite the damage, and the plane lifted off again. Remarkably, 85-year-old pilot Chris Georgaklis—accompanied by his dog, Buddy—then flew the crippled aircraft 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and landed safely. Gear-up landings are usually caused by pilot error or a gear-deployment failure; the FAA is investigating."

12-0,"After Tropical Cyclone Olwyn, a 5.68 m juvenile female Omura’s whale washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia—marking the first record in WA and only the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff initially struggled to identify the carcass, but DNA profiling confirmed it as the rare species, first described in 2003 and believed confined to tropical and subtropical Indo-Pacific waters (Indonesia, the Philippines, Sea of Japan). Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the find “highly significant,” noting that little is known about the whale and that new insights will refine field identification and distribution maps. Omura’s whales are distinguished by a sleek body and unique skeleton—reportedly 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin (some accounts cite 60 vertebrae). The carcass has been buried; its skeleton will be exhumed in a few years for further study and potential museum display."
12-1,"Conor McGregor is set to challenge José Aldo for the UFC featherweight title on July 11 in Las Vegas. The 26-year-old Irishman, already sporting a gorilla-eating-a-heart tattoo on his chest, has just revealed a fierce tiger’s face inked on his stomach—captioned on Instagram, “If you see the tiger, it’s too late. You’re food.” McGregor insists he’s more motivated than Aldo, accusing the champion of not wanting to defend his belt “in my presence.” The tension boiled over in March during a Dublin promotional event when McGregor grabbed Aldo’s title and held it aloft before 5,000 home fans, underscoring their fractious rivalry as fight night approaches."
12-3,"At 15:48 local time, a magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck 15.5 km beneath Garfagnana, 35 km north of Lucca, Italy. It was felt as far away as Milan, Florence, Bologna and Modena. No injuries or damage were immediately reported, though several lower-magnitude aftershocks followed, cutting power and phone lines in Garfagnana and prompting precautionary school evacuations and inspections. Alessandro Amato of Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology described the event as a “classic,” medium-strong, fairly shallow quake that “came out of nowhere.” Italy’s seismic history includes the deadly 2009 L’Aquila earthquake—after which six scientists and an official were convicted of manslaughter for giving reassuring but inaccurate safety information—and two magnitude-6 quakes in the same region last May that killed over 20 people."
12-4,"Bobbi Kristina Brown, 22, remains unresponsive with “global and irreversible brain damage,” her grandmother Cissy Houston said after visiting her. Although she’s out of a medically induced coma and has a tracheostomy, she doesn’t respond to voices or track movement with her eyes. A family source told CNN her neurological state hasn’t changed in nearly three months. Two days earlier, her father Bobby Brown—who was emotional onstage—said she was awake and watching him, and family attorney Christopher Brown confirmed her condition has improved but said her long-term quality of life won’t be known for years as she begins a difficult rehabilitation."
