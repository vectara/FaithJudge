14-0,"Militants from the so-called Islamic State attacked the 400-bed Sardar Daud hospital by detonating explosives at its gate and then opening fire on staff and patients, injuring more than 50 people. Commandos later landed on the hospital roof and, after several hours of fighting, killed all four attackers. This incident marks the first direct engagement between IS fighters and security forces in the capital—a change from their previous tactics of targeting civilian gatherings—and suggests they may now have more military resources and training. While IS claimed responsibility, the Taliban denied involvement. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as an assault on Afghanistan’s values, and the episode comes amid ongoing IS activities and a broader context of violence in the country."

14-2,"Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by choosing a ""third way"" for his tenure: instead of staying until 2021 or leaving in 2018 as planned, he extended his term by only one year, stepping down in 2019. Although his decision would provide market stability during the Brexit negotiations, he emphasized that the choice was driven entirely by personal reasons—particularly his family’s needs, as his younger daughters were approaching key academic milestones. Carney also clarified that there was no political pressure influencing his decision."
14-3,"The passage reports on the death of Adrian Gill, a celebrated and controversial journalist at the Sunday Times. Diagnosed with multiple cancers—which he described as the ""full English"" of cancers—Gill continued to work and even penned his final column about coming to terms with his illness just before his death was announced by editor Martin Ivens. Praised by colleagues for his wit, fearless writing, and compassionate intelligence, Gill was remembered as a giant among journalists and the heart and soul of the paper.

These attacks include DDoS operations to overwhelm websites, hacking into servers and CCTV systems, and even commandeering electronic billboards and network printers to broadcast pro-Ukrainian messages. The group has released data purportedly showing evidence of Russian military movements and has urged others to analyze this information. In contrast, the passage describes Cyber Berkut as an anti-Western hacker group that attacked Ukrainian government websites during high-profile events, leaked documents regarding US military support, and claimed responsibility for disrupting electoral systems. Additionally, the group Anonymous International, known for publishing leaked Kremlin documents, is mentioned as focusing on Russian domestic affairs with some coverage of Ukraine. The overall narrative illustrates the active and multifaceted use of cyber warfare in the conflict between Ukrainian forces and their opponents."

Lewis and his expertise on the medieval longbow—and his lengthy acting career noted for roles in All Creatures Great and Small, multiple portrayals of Winston Churchill, and an appearance in the Harry Potter films as Cornelius Fudge.

15-3,"A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that from 2005 to 2012 heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2%, driven mainly by rising binge-drinking rates among women. In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers, with some counties showing marked differences in rates. Researchers linked these trends to changing social norms, particularly among women, along with economic factors like cheaper alcohol, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies."
4-0,"The passage recounts a game where the Giants opened with a short-handed goal from player-coach Derrick Walser, but the Panthers tied it with Jeff Dimmen.

Second, 21‐year‐old striker Keating—recommended by ex-Port Vale manager Micky Adams and with previous spells at Sligo Rovers, Galway United, and Finn Harps, pending international clearance—has also been signed. Manager Kevin Nicholson emphasized that while his 27‐year‐old signing (referred to as ""Myles"") may lack game time, he brings leadership qualities, and he also described the young striker (referred to as ""Ruairi"") as raw but eager. The Gulls are currently four points above the relegation zone, having won only one of their last six games."
9-0,"The passage provides information on two historical figures named Francis I. The first, Francis I (8 December 1708 – 18 August 1765), was Holy Roman Emperor and Grand Duke of Tuscany, although his wife wielded the true governing power. The second, Francis I (12 September 1494 – 31 March 1547), was the first King of France from the Angoulême branch of the House of Valois.

Dracone spun, clipping Phillips' leg, which required Phillips to receive stitches at the infield care center before being released. The race was also affected by poor traction after several hours of rain, and Dracone, aged 19 and from Italy, did not finish, ending up in 23rd place."
9-2,"Widnes Vikings secured a hard-fought victory over Castleford Tigers. In the first half, tries by Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van, and Chris Bridge gave Widnes a 14–6 lead, with Castleford loanee Paddy Flynn replying for his parent club. Early in the second half, Flynn scored again, but further tries from Ah Van, two from Lloyd White, and one from Joe Mellor extended Widnes’ lead to 38–12. Although Castleford mounted a late comeback—registering three tries in four minutes through Larne Patrick (who had just signed a three‐year deal from Huddersfield), Luke Gale, and another from Flynn (completing a hat-trick)—they were unable to overcome the deficit, suffering their fourth consecutive home league defeat. As a result, Widnes climbed above Wakefield into seventh place, while Castleford remained in sixth, one point ahead of the Vikings."
9-3,"Clarkson, 30, who rejoined St Mirren in July for his second spell, may make his Championship debut against Alloa on Saturday. Last season at Dundee, he scored nine goals and has mostly appeared as a substitute this term. Clarkson expressed confidence in his fitness and readiness for match play, noting that he has maintained his form by playing in games and for the U20s. With nearly 400 club appearances and previous spells at Bristol City, Brentford, and Bristol Rovers—and having been capped twice by Scotland in 2008 (scoring once)—he hopes to contribute to St Mirren’s push up the table.

16-0,"The passage highlights two major topics in boxing history. First, it introduces the upcoming Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao fight as potentially the most financially significant and historically important bout of the century, with its ultimate ranking depending on the outcome that night in Las Vegas. It then shifts to recount the legendary series of fights between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran, a rivalry emblematic of boxing’s golden era. The narrative details the confusion and controversy in their first encounter, culminating in a rematch where Leonard’s speed and movement overwhelmed Duran, leading to Duran’s infamous “no mas” moment in the eighth round. This dramatic episode not only stunned the world but also tarnished Duran’s reputation in Panama, though he later redeemed himself by winning another title. Leonard, for his part, regarded forcing Duran to quit as a more significant achievement than a knockout."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy is determined to win the Masters to complete a career grand slam, viewing it as unthinkable to finish his career without a green jacket. At 25, he sees Augusta National as a special place where he can achieve something only a few legends have, despite his only top-10 finish in six appearances and a notable final-round collapse in 2011 that taught him invaluable lessons. McIlroy, who has since secured several major wins and overcome personal and legal challenges, considers the course his sanctuary from external pressures and believes that he can eventually master it both in his first win and, potentially, in multiple victories."
16-2,"Pablo Mandado and Ilze Zebolde, a Spanish-Latvian couple who left their restaurant jobs in Manchester, are pursuing a dream of exploring the world by bicycle with no specific agenda. Over the past 356 days, they have covered nearly 7,000 miles through 16 countries, largely relying on free or very inexpensive accommodations like camping, Couchsurfing, and Warmshowers. Living on less than three euros a day—with food costing only about 2.74 euros daily—they travel on a tight budget using pedal power instead of other transport. After starting their journey in London and cycling through various parts of Europe, they have crossed from Europe into Asia and plan to continue their travels, including an eventual route across the American continent, with no set end in sight."

In just 356 days, they have ridden nearly 7,000 miles through 16 countries, mostly sustaining themselves on less than three euros a day by camping and using free hosting sites like Couchsurfing and Warmshowers. Their journey, which began in London and took them through France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Eastern Europe, and Turkey—where crossing into another continent was a symbolic milestone—continues as they plan to explore Asia next and eventually cycle across the entire American continent."
16-4,"A three-bedroom maisonette in Knightsbridge is on sale for £575,000 despite having only three years remaining on its lease. The property, located in Egerton Place and featuring 1,990 sq/ft of space with two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift, parking, and a communal garden, is unmodernised and needs renovation. Its short lease equates to a cost of about £191,000 per year—roughly matching current rental rates for similar properties in the area. Although the low price appears attractive, extending the lease could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million, potentially increasing the property's value to £6 million or more. The property is marketed by Russell Simpson, and there is significant interest from locals, developers, and end users."
6-0,"The passage reports that Storey, a 37-year-old British athlete, finished over two minutes ahead of Poland’s Anna Harkowska in Nottwil, Switzerland, and is set to compete in a road race where she could earn her 17th title.

6-1,"The passage introduces two British boxers from the Eubank family. It first highlights Chris Eubank (born 1966), a retired professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 1998.

6-3,"The passage reports that 39‐year-old former Dons midfielder Sheerin, who has managed Arbroath (the Red Lichties) as player-manager since 2010, has been appointed by Aberdeen at Pittodrie to replace Neil Cooper. Despite Arbroath’s relegation to Scottish League Two following their bottom finish in League One in the 2013-14 season, Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes selected Sheerin following a comprehensive process, as confirmed by chief executive Duncan Fraser. Additionally, Fraser noted that although there was a wish to retain another player (Paul), Arbroath chairman John Christison understood the player's desire to return to Aberdeen. The passage also highlights Sheerin’s career history, including his time at various Scottish clubs and his stint in Sweden with Östersunds, his Scotland Under-21 cap from the mid-1990s, and his achievement in leading Arbroath to their first national trophy by winning the Scottish Third Division and securing promotion in 2011."
6-4,"The passage explains that internal tensions led lead singer de la Rocha to quit Rage Against the Machine, which resulted in the band’s breakup.

That same year, Rage Against the Machine reunited, performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

8-4,"AP McCoy’s mount, Mr Mole, is one of three 7-2 co-favourites in the seven-runner Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday. Trained by Paul Nicholls, Mr Mole is set to run alongside Irish Raider Special Tiara and Nicky Henderson’s Sprinter Sacre, the latter being ridden by Nico de Boinville due to Barry Geraghty’s injury.

Also in the race is Mick Channon’s Somersby."
11-1,"Jack Nicklaus, at age 75, delighted the crowd at the par-3 contest at Augusta National by hitting a hole-in-one on a 130‐yard hole. Playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw and during the opening of Masters week, his successful shot—despite soaring beyond the flag before curving into the hole—became a memorable moment, even though it was later overshadowed by Camilo Villegas’s subsequent ace (and another later ace) on the same day. The passage also highlights Nicklaus’s storied career, noting that he was the youngest to win a green jacket in 1963, won his sixth in 1986, and is one of only five golfers to have completed the career grand slam."
11-3,"Scientists in Western Australia have found a juvenile female Omura's whale washed up on a remote Exmouth beach after tropical cyclone Olwyn, marking the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. The whale, measuring 5.68 meters and confirmed by DNA profiling, offers a rare opportunity to study the species—which was first described in 2003 and is typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. Its unique skeletal features, including specific vertebrae counts and pectoral fin digits, may help improve identification guides. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton in a few years for further scientific research and potential museum display."

This finding, the first in Western Australia and only the second in Australia, was confirmed through DNA profiling by wildlife staff. Typically found in tropical and subtropical waters around Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, the whale’s unique skeletal features (including a noted number of vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin) will be further studied once its skeleton is recovered for scientific investigation and potential museum display."

10-0,"The passage describes the official opening of the Su-24 jet's ""black box"" in Moscow. Nikolai Primak, the head of the investigation, noted missing flight data, which may clarify where the jet was located when hit. The jet was shot down by F-16 fighters on 24 November, leading to a major diplomatic crisis between Russia and Turkey. Turkey claims the jet ignored warnings and entered its airspace, while Russia asserts it was within Syrian airspace. The incident resulted in the death of the pilot (the navigator was rescued, although reportedly injured) and a Russian marine, with a rescue helicopter also destroyed. In response, Russia has imposed sanctions on Turkey, including a ban on package holidays, and demands an apology from Turkey, further escalating tensions between the two nations."
10-2,"An explosion at a chemical plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, China injured six people, with five hurt by broken glass. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility following an oil leak and led to a significant fire that required the efforts of over 600 firefighters to bring under control. The plant, which produces carcinogenic paraxylene for the manufacture of polyester materials, has a controversial history including a similar explosion in July 2013 and relocation after public protests over pollution concerns. Residents near the plant reported the event on social media."
10-3,"The passage details a court case in which a 34‐year‐old defendant—formerly known as David Ayrton and now called Davina, having changed her name in 2012—is on trial for raping a 15‐year‐old girl in a Portsmouth garage in autumn 2004. During the trial, Davina, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, denied the charge. The victim, who had only consumed a small amount of alcohol, recalled that she shouted at Davina to stop the attack while her friends slept. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody—likely in a male prison in Winchester—citing risks to her safety and potential failure to attend court if released, and noted the unique and challenging nature of the case. Protocols for her detention have been established, and information about the attack had earlier been disclosed by Davina to a care home worker in 2014."
10-4,"Eugene, USA, has been chosen to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships. The IAAF Council made an exception to the normal bidding process, citing a unique strategic opportunity to stage the event in the United States. Although Eugene had previously lost its bid for the 2019 championships (which were awarded to Doha, Qatar), a strong presentation convinced the IAAF that the city was ready. IAAF president Lamine Diack emphasized that this decision would allow the sport to tap into a key market, similar to how the 2007 championships in Osaka were awarded without a conventional bidding process."
