15599,"Blue Bell Creameries has closed its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant after listeria was found in a 3-ounce cup of ice cream produced there. The CDC warns consumers not to eat any Blue Bell items from that plant—specifically 3-ounce cups marked with codes O, P, Q, R, S or T—though other Blue Bell products are not included in this warning. The company is recalling the implicated cups and had previously recalled products from a Texas facility tied to a Kansas hospital outbreak in which five people were infected and three died. Genetic tests show the listeria in ice cream from the Broken Arrow plant matches bacteria found in a Kansas hospital sample, but investigations continue to determine if the ice cream caused the illnesses. This marks Blue Bell’s first recall in its 108-year history. The CDC urges disposal of the recalled products, noting listeriosis poses serious risks, especially to vulnerable populations."
15601,"An outside investigation by Columbia Journalism School found that Rolling Stone’s article on an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia was “deeply flawed,” citing failures in reporting, editing, supervision, and fact-checking. Rolling Stone’s managing editor publicly apologized to readers, Phi Kappa Psi, UVA administrators, and students. 

Legal analysis in the passage asks whether UVA or fraternity members could sue for defamation:

• Elements of libel under Virginia law: publication of a false, defamatory statement made with the required intent.  
• UVA, as a public (governmental) institution, cannot sue for defamation.  
• Group defamation rules bar suits by large or undefined groups; individuals can sue only if the group is “comparatively small” and the statement clearly targets each member.  
• Phi Kappa Psi might invoke this “small-group” exception, arguing the article’s claims were imputed to identifiable members, while Rolling Stone would counter that the fraternity is too large and fluid for individual injury to be presumed.  
• Other fraternities not named in the story likely have no viable claim.  

Although libel suits are rare and require proof of concrete damages, fraternity members could potentially clear the preliminary hurdles and pursue a successful claim, whereas UVA cannot."
15604,"The author—Kentucky’s first female and first non-white state senator (elected in 1967)—rebukes fellow Kentuckian Rand Paul as he launches his presidential bid. She says his pledge to “expand” and “include” minorities is belied by his record: questioning the Civil Rights Act, resisting stronger Voting Rights Act protections, suggesting private businesses may discriminate, wanting to abolish the Department of Education, limiting women’s reproductive choices, opposing protections for DREAMers, and delivering tone-deaf speeches at historically Black colleges. She argues these positions would drag the nation backward, labeling them outdated and disqualifying, and concludes that Americans deserve a leader genuinely committed to civil rights, voting access, and progress."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau, formerly a 34-year-old Seattle teacher, began a sexual relationship with her 13-year-old student Vili Fualaau in 1996, bore his child, and served more than seven years in prison. After her 2005 release they married, will mark their 10th anniversary on May 20, and have two teenage daughters. Now 53 and 31, the couple tell ABC’s “20/20” they remain happy; she discusses what sustains their marriage, her wish to teach again, and hopes to end her sex-offender status, while he reflects on struggles with alcoholism, depression, and feeling the system failed him."
15616,"• Photographer Daniel Ramos sued Kanye West over a July 19, 2013 incident at Los Angeles International Airport in which West attacked him and tried to grab his camera; the altercation was recorded on video.  
• West had already pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery for the scuffle and received two years’ probation, anger-management classes, and community service.  
• Ramos and attorney Gloria Allred sought general and punitive damages; trial was scheduled for the following week.  
• The parties settled, leading Ramos to dismiss the case. Key term disclosed: West issued a personal apology, and the two shook hands.  
• Allred said the outcome shows celebrities are not above the law."
15617,"B.B. King, 89, was briefly hospitalized for dehydration brought on by his Type II diabetes but says he is “much better” and went home Tuesday to rest with his grandchildren, according to daughter Claudette King and her publicist. He thanked fans for their concern; no other hospitalization details were given. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee—known for naming his Gibson guitars “Lucille” and for hits such as “The Thrill Is Gone,” “There Must Be a Better World Somewhere,” and “When Love Comes to Town”—previously battled dehydration and exhaustion after a Chicago show last year."
15623,"Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland, 31, and his companion Katrine Saltara were stabbed around 4 a.m. Wednesday on a street near the 1OAK nightclub in New York’s Chelsea district after leaving the club minutes earlier. A 22-year-old Brooklyn man — who never entered 1OAK — allegedly attacked them and another woman outside the Fulton Houses, then was detained by Copeland’s driver; a knife was recovered and charges are pending. Copeland sustained wounds to his left elbow and abdomen and is in stable condition; Saltara and the third woman received slash injuries.

Atlanta Hawks players Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30, present to check on Copeland, were arrested for obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct (Sefolosha also for resisting arrest) after police said they interfered with the crime-scene setup. The Hawks and NBA are reviewing the matter; neither player will dress for Wednesday’s game against the Nets."
15627,"Selena’s family is partnering with Nevada tech firm Acrovirt LLC to create “Selena the One,” a hologram-like, interactive digital version of the Tejano star who died 20 years ago. The figure is intended to walk, talk, sing, dance, autonomously learn and react, and will be the first use of Acrovirt’s “Digitized Human Essence” technology. Plans call for the virtual Selena to release new music and videos, collaborate with current artists, and tour in 2018. An Indiegogo campaign at www.selenatheone.com launches April 16 to raise $500,000 for development. The project seeks to extend her legacy—already evident in her 2 million-like Facebook page—and coincides with the Fiesta de la Flor celebration in Corpus Christi on April 17–18."
15628,"Shortly after Alaska Airlines Flight 448 left Seattle for Los Angeles on Monday, the pilot heard banging from the cargo hold and returned to the airport. The noise came from a Menzies Aviation ramp agent who had accidentally fallen asleep in the pressurized, temperature-controlled hold while loading luggage. Passengers heard pounding and faint cries; a federal air marshal responded before the 14-minute flight ended in an emergency landing. The agent, whose shift had been due to end just before departure, was hospitalized as a precaution, passed a drug test, and was released. Alaska Airlines is investigating; the rescheduled flight later reached Los Angeles."
15634,"Emy Afalava, a decorated veteran born in the U.S. territory of American Samoa, is barred from voting because the federal government claims he is not a U.S. citizen. He and other Samoans are challenging this in a pending D.C. Circuit lawsuit, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to all persons born on U.S. soil. The denial echoes past race-based exclusions: the Dred Scott decision that stripped free Black people of citizenship until reversed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and the early-1900s Isabel Gonzalez case, in which the Supreme Court refused to confirm Puerto Ricans as citizens while labeling island peoples racially inferior. Although residents of every other U.S. island territory have since gained citizenship, American Samoans remain the only Americans still denied it."
15638,"Iman (25) and Siham Hashi (27)—the Somali-Canadian sisters who perform as Faarrow—are recording their debut album in Los Angeles. Born in Mogadishu and displaced by the 1991 war, they grew up in Canada, discovered music in their teens, and later moved through Atlanta to L.A. Their Warner Bros. release, co-written and produced with actor-musician Elijah Kelley, blends pop with hip-hop and African percussion; it is in the final mixing stage ahead of a first single. Musical touchstones include Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, the Spice Girls, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Beyond music, the sisters serve as UNHCR spokespeople, stage benefit concerts, and run Wish Creatively (“Women Internationally Selling Hope”), a jewelry line funding income projects for women in Kenya and Somalia. They aim to use their growing platform to inspire others and support Somali refugees."
15651,"Pope Francis, balancing the Vatican’s moral authority with its diplomatic interests, faced whether to label the 1915–1917 slaughter of more than one million Armenians as “genocide” during a centenary Mass in Rome. Previous popes had skirted the term: John Paul II used it only in a written statement (2001) and Benedict XVI avoided it entirely. Francis employed the word by quoting John Paul’s text, calling the massacre “the first genocide of the 20th century.” The citation preserved the Vatican’s prized sense of continuity while limiting, but not preventing, Turkish backlash. Turkey promptly recalled its ambassador, summoned the Vatican envoy, and condemned the remark as “unacceptable.” The episode illustrates Francis’ characteristic blend of blunt moral speech and cautious diplomacy—also seen in his roles in U.S.–Cuba talks, Middle-East initiatives, and comments on ISIS—while he urges clergy to speak candidly despite potential controversy."
15652,"During National Park Week (April 18–26), all 128 U.S. national parks that normally charge entry fees—such as Yellowstone and Yosemite—will be free on Saturday and Sunday. The National Park Service and the National Park Foundation are hosting activities nationwide, including night astronomy events, Revolutionary War programs, Earth Day celebrations, and Junior Ranger offerings. Visitors can find nearby parks at FindYourPark.com, get more ideas at nationalparkweek.org, and share experiences with the hashtag #FindYourPark."
15661,"TEPCO sent two shape-shifting robots into Fukushima’s damaged reactor to gather data in an area still too radioactive for people.  
• The first robot, deployed April 10, traveled about 10 m before a fallen object blocked it; after collecting radiation data at 14 of 18 planned spots, its cable was cut on April 12.  
• A second robot entered on April 15, completed readings at all 11 assigned points, and photographed an unexplained green glow and yellow discoloration (the glow vanished from other angles).  
• The probe found radiation and temperature levels lower than expected, suggesting the cooling system is working, which plant chief Akira Ono called a major step toward decommissioning.  
• Cleanup of the 2011 meltdown site will take years and an estimated $50 billion. TEPCO terms the robotic exploration “unprecedented.”"
15665,"Jurors in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s sentencing phase, having already convicted him on all counts for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, heard emotional victim-impact testimony. Prosecutors, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini, argued for the death penalty by detailing the lives lost and the suffering caused:

• Four people were killed: Krystle Campbell (29), Lingzi Lu (Chinese graduate student), Martin Richard (8), and MIT Officer Sean Collier. Families described their grief, with Campbell’s father calling her “the light of my life.”  
• Survivors recounted harrowing injuries. High-school senior Gillian Reny described a shattered leg and scenes of “blood everywhere.” Celeste Corcoran, who lost both legs, spoke of excruciating pain and ongoing daily challenges.  
• Jurors saw contrasting images: photographs of victims’ happier times and a courthouse holding-cell picture of Tsarnaev defiantly giving the camera the middle finger. Pellegrini said it showed him “unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.”

The testimony aims to guide the jury’s upcoming decision on whether Tsarnaev, 21, will receive a death sentence or life imprisonment."

Overall: a supersized, record-breaking show with standout performances and a few dragged-out or ill-judged segments."
15670,"Polish aristocrat Prince Jan Zylinski, angered by what he calls rising anti-Polish sentiment and Nigel Farage’s blame of Eastern European migrants for UK problems, released a YouTube video challenging the UKIP leader to a sword duel in London’s Hyde Park—or, failing that, to a televised debate—before the 7 May British elections. Brandishing his father’s WWII sword, Zylinski said “enough is enough” regarding attacks on Poles and listed their contributions to Britain. Farage, whose anti-EU, anti-immigration platform includes quitting the EU and restricting free movement and foreign aid, declined the duel; a party colleague jokingly tweeted an image suggesting Farage would win."
15673,"A Cessna 414 returning from Monday night’s NCAA men’s basketball final in Indianapolis crashed about two miles east of Central Illinois Regional Airport, roughly five miles from Illinois State University’s campus, killing all seven aboard. Among the dead were Torrey Ward, ISU’s associate men’s basketball coach, and Aaron Leetch, the university’s deputy athletic director. Ward, a former UAB standout who coached at several schools before joining ISU in 2012 and becoming associate head coach in 2014, and Leetch, who first came to ISU in 2005 and returned as deputy director of athletics in 2013, were both widely praised by school officials. ISU President Larry Dietz and Athletic Director Larry Lyons expressed profound grief and pledged support for the victims’ families, while spokesman John Twork said the university community is “reeling from the loss.” The identities of the other passengers were not immediately released."
15683,"During the sentencing phase of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s trial, prosecutors concluded their case with emotional, graphic testimony from victims and medical personnel.  

• Survivor Steve Woolfenden described losing part of his left leg while shielding his 3-year-old son, Leo, who was also wounded.  
• Trauma surgeon Dr. David King likened the injuries he treated that day to battlefield wounds.  
• Heather Abbott recounted choosing a below-knee amputation after three unsuccessful surgeries to save her shattered foot.  
• Marc Fucarile detailed losing his right leg, sustaining severe burns, and now taking more than 70 pills daily.  
• Video and medical evidence about 8-year-old Martin Richard’s fatal injuries were shown; his parents oppose the death penalty and did not join this phase.

The prosecution aimed to portray Tsarnaev as cold and remorseless; the defense, led by Judy Clarke, will begin Monday, likely emphasizing his troubled upbringing. Relatives of Tsarnaev have arrived in Boston, though it is unclear if they will testify. The jury will decide between a death sentence or life imprisonment."
15690,"Actress Sofia Vergara’s ex-fiancé, businessman Nick Loeb, has filed an anonymous lawsuit in Los Angeles to stop Vergara from destroying the former couple’s two frozen female embryos, created through IVF in November 2013 while they were engaged. Loeb wants the embryos implanted in a surrogate and says he will waive any parental or financial claims against Vergara. The suit also names the Beverly Hills clinic storing the embryos and seeks a court order barring their destruction until both parties agree. Previous attempts with two surrogates were unsuccessful. Legal specialists quoted in the story describe the case as a developing, uncertain area of law that pits questions of embryo “ownership” and the definition of life against existing contractual agreements. Vergara’s representatives declined comment; Loeb’s attorney confirmed the filing. Vergara, now engaged to actor Joe Manganiello and promoting the film “Hot Pursuit,” had earlier discussed freezing eggs to have future children with Loeb."
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, now 65 and living in Luxor, Egypt, has spent 43 years disguising herself as a man—donning a male jalabiya and working first as a brick maker and then a shoeshiner—to support her daughter after being widowed at 21 while six months pregnant. In conservative southern Egypt, where women’s employment is rare, the male identity let her earn money, educate her child, and shield them both from social oppression. A recent CBC interview prompted the Luxor governor to give her a kiosk and cash advance (which she accepted only while dressed as a man), and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi honored her as one of Egypt’s “ideal mothers.” Dahou says she will never abandon the male attire that enabled her to raise and protect her family."
15695,"A Massachusetts jury spent more than 35 hours across seven days weighing testimony from 130-plus witnesses and 400-plus exhibits in Aaron Hernandez’s murder trial. On April 15, the panel, led by foreperson Lesa Strachan, found the former NFL star guilty of first-degree murder in the June 17, 2013, shooting of Odin Lloyd, who was hit by six bullets after being seen in a rented Nissan Altima with Hernandez and co-defendants Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace (both to be tried later). Jurors said the brutality of multiple shots and Hernandez’s apparent “indifference” afterward—sunbathing and drinking smoothies with the co-defendants—were decisive. They stressed that his football fame and uncertainty over who fired the gun did not influence the verdict. The conviction carries life without parole, and jurors described the process as emotionally exhausting and far removed from TV portrayals of courtroom drama."
15696,"SkyWest Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 carrying 84 people (75 passengers, 9 crew) from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo. Mid-flight, a flight attendant reported a sick passenger, then warned of a pressurization issue; passengers soon felt dizziness and some lost consciousness. The aircraft descended 28,000 feet in three minutes and landed safely. Fifteen passengers were evaluated at the airport; none required hospitalization. SkyWest says maintenance found no pressurization fault, and the airline, FAA and NTSB are investigating."
15700,"Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez showed no remorse during his murder trial, displaying swagger in court and offering no credible alibi. His own lawyer said Hernandez merely “witnessed” Odin Lloyd’s 2013 killing, yet the jury, weighing extensive circumstantial evidence, convicted him of first-degree murder as well as unlawful firearm and ammunition possession. Hernandez, 25, received life without parole. The commentary notes public discomfort with his arrogance but stresses that evidence, not demeanor, decided the case. It recounts his rise—star at the University of Florida, John Mackey Award winner, $40 million NFL contract—and his troubles after his father’s 2006 death: bar fights, drug issues, and earlier shooting questions. Drafted in 2010, he was already labeled “troubled.” The Patriots swiftly cut him once charges emerged, and the author says team and league acted properly. Concluding, the piece laments wasted lives and asserts that Hernandez’s crime was unpredictable despite vetting."
15702,"Louis Jordan, 37, left Conway, South Carolina, on his 35-foot sailboat to fish but was capsized by a storm a few days into the trip, breaking his mast and his shoulder. Unable to make progress, he drifted for 66 days, enduring at least a dozen storms. He survived by collecting rainwater—eventually filling a 25-gallon tank—and catching fish that were attracted to laundry he rinsed overboard. On Thursday, the container ship Houston Express spotted his listing boat hundreds of miles offshore; crew members found him alert and in surprisingly good condition. He was transferred to a Coast Guard helicopter and walked into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital that evening. The Coast Guard, which had been alerted by his father on January 29, finds no reason to doubt his account."
15708,"• Prosecutor Brice Robin, who heads the Germanwings Flight 9525 probe, says investigators have no onboard video and urges anyone possessing one to hand it over.  
• French magazine Paris Match and German daily Bild claim they viewed a cellphone video from the crash site that captures passengers’ final moments, but authorities—including the BEA and Gendarmerie spokesman Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini—call the reports false, saying recovered phones have not yet been analyzed and none have left the site.  
• Bild editor Julian Reichelt maintains the clip is genuine and notes investigators admitted to recovering phones only after the media reports.  
• Lufthansa now confirms co-pilot Andreas Lubitz disclosed a “severe depression” episode to its flight school in 2009; despite this, he completed training and held valid licenses and a medical certificate.  
• German and French investigators say past records show Lubitz once had suicidal tendencies and recently consulted eye and neuropsychology specialists who deemed him unfit to work; a key theory is that he feared losing his license.  
• Recovery teams have removed nearly all visible human remains, will begin collecting personal belongings—including more phones—on Wednesday, and expect DNA identification of all 150 victims by week’s end."
15714,"A nuclear submarine in dry dock at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire while undergoing repairs that began in November 2013. The blaze started in the rubber insulation between the vessel’s light and pressure hull during welding work. According to officials quoted by ITAR-Tass and RIA Novosti, the submarine had no ammunition aboard, its nuclear fuel and other hazardous materials had been removed, all personnel evacuated safely, and there were no injuries or danger to people or the facility."
15733,"HBO’s documentary “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,” based on Lawrence Wright’s book and critical of Scientology, is generating attention, but Scientologist John Travolta says he hasn’t watched it and isn’t interested. While premiering his new movie “The Forger” in Clearwater, Florida, Travolta—one of the church’s best-known members—called the film negative and said it reflects views of “disgruntled” former members. Citing four decades of positive involvement with Scientology, he credited the religion with helping him cope after his son Jett’s 2009 death and said neither he nor fellow member Tom Cruise has experienced the alleged problems highlighted in the documentary."
15735,"During an Exotic Driving Experience event at Walt Disney World Speedway on Sunday, a Lamborghini struck a guardrail. Passenger Gary Terry, 36, of Davenport, Florida, was killed at the scene, while driver Tavon Watson, 24, of Kissimmee, sustained minor injuries and was hospitalized. Petty Holdings, operator of the attraction (and of the Richard Petty Driving Experience), issued a statement expressing condolences. CNN reporters Vivan Kuo and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to the report."
15739,"• Celebrity Infinity currently has a gastrointestinal outbreak affecting 100 people—95 of 2,117 passengers and 5 of 964 crew—with vomiting and diarrhea reported.  
• Cause is still unknown; two CDC staff will board the ship in San Diego on Monday to investigate.  
• The ship departed San Diego on March 29 and last stopped in Puerto Vallarta on April 10.  
• Celebrity Cruises has boosted cleaning, kept passengers informed, and collected specimens for CDC testing.  
• This is the vessel’s third such outbreak (previous ones in 2006 and 2013); the ship was built in 2001 and refurbished in 2011."
15740,"• In a chalk quarry beneath Naours, France (about 120 miles north of Paris), an extensive underground “city” has revealed nearly 2,000 pieces of WWI soldiers’ graffiti, many dated July 1916.  
• Photographer and ER doctor Jeff Gusky is documenting the site for National Geographic; he has recorded 1,821 names—around 40 % Australian, most of the rest British, 55 American, and 662 still untraced.  
• The subterranean complex, centuries old and sealed in the 18th century, was reopened in the late 19th century and used by troops as a refuge near the front lines of the 1916 Somme battles.  
• Privately owned and largely inaccessible until a 2013 change of ownership, the maze-like passages are now being explored; carved maps helped soldiers navigate the dark corridors.  
• The inscriptions, still sharp and legible, offer a poignant human link—such as Private H. J. Leach, who wrote his name on 13 July 1916 and was killed a month later."
15744,"Rolling Stone’s now-retracted gang-rape story about a student called “Jackie” collapsed because the reporter failed to contact key witnesses, but the broader, undisputed issues it highlighted remain:

• University of Virginia’s record: since 1998 it has expelled 183 students for honor-code cheating, yet never a single student for sexual assault, even when assaults were admitted.  
• Ongoing scrutiny:  – A Virginia attorney-general–commissioned probe by O’Melveny & Myers is reviewing the school’s past handling of sexual-assault cases, including Jackie’s.  
  – A separate U.S. Department of Education Title IX investigation stems from a civil suit alleging UVA medical staff lost or destroyed evidence.  
• Jackie’s case: she reported a 2012 fraternity-house assault to UVA in 2013 and to police only after a 2014 bottle-throwing incident, but then refused to cooperate, halting any criminal inquiry.  
• Campus climate: multiple women describe a culture that minimizes rape (“bad experience”), tags certain fraternities as “rapey,” and discourages reporting because attackers rarely face expulsion.  
• University response: after the article UVA announced an undefined “zero-tolerance” sexual-assault policy and began wider discussions of reform.  
• Fallout: survivors worry the retraction will deter victims from coming forward, while observers note the sensationalized false narrative has obscured the more common problem of acquaintance rape and systemic administrative failures."
15747,"Chinese-born, U.S.–based entrepreneur Jia Jiang quit a six-figure job to chase start-up dreams, was turned down for funding, and decided to confront his terror of hearing “no” by blogging “100 Days of Rejection.” During the experiment he made one unusual request per day (e.g., asking a stranger for $100 or requesting Olympic-ring doughnuts at Krispy Kreme). On day 3 manager Jackie Braun fulfilled the doughnut request; Jiang’s video went viral, bringing media attention, speaking invitations and job offers—though his aim remained conquering rejection, not courting fame. His experience led to the new book “Rejection Proof,” a blend of memoir and self-help in which he argues that embracing rejection converts it from obstacle to opportunity. Jiang distills eight key lessons: 1) fear of rejection limits us more than rejection itself; 2) acceptance is partly a numbers game; 3) a “no” doesn’t judge an idea’s worth; 4) don’t flee after rejection—engage; 5) ask why and seek alternatives; 6) decide how many “no’s” you can take; 7) build immunity through repeated asking; 8) remember rejection is just one person’s opinion, so stand confidently."
15753,"Over the past year the largest Ebola outbreak on record has infected more than 25,000 people and killed over 10,000. Although the overall intensity is waning—only 30 new cases were reported for the week of April 5, the lowest since May 2014—Ebola has exposed weaknesses in global health systems and continues to pose risks. Liberia and Sierra Leone now have so few patients that treatment centers are being closed, yet Guinea still struggles: of 19 Ebola deaths that week, seven were detected only after death and 21 unsafe burials were logged. The World Health Organization warns that undetected transmission chains could still spark new infections."
15759,"The author, shaken by video of Officer Michael Slager shooting the fleeing Walter Scott, argues that the footage both exposes apparent police misconduct and ensures accountability—something unlikely without the bystander’s camera. He maintains that mandatory police body cameras could have deterred the shooting, prevented any cover-up, saved Scott’s life, and spared Slager from severe criminal charges. Though costly, body cams are cheaper than civil payouts and, more importantly, help restore public trust by reducing complaints and use-of-force incidents. The author calls them only a stopgap: the deeper issue is systemic bias against black men that drives disproportionate police shootings. Long-term fixes require better hiring standards, bias training, and broad social reforms, but until those arrive, body cameras can at least illuminate and curb racially biased policing."
15778,"Thousands of Yazidis who fled ISIS now live in the six-month-old Shariya refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, about 18 miles from the front line. Most came from Sinjar after the August assault in which ISIS killed men who refused to convert and seized women and girls, selling many as sex slaves.  

One family’s story frames the ordeal: while Mahmoud was away, ISIS abducted his wife Ahlam, their three small children and his elderly parents. The captives were trucked to Tal Afar, shuffled between villages (including Mosul), and forced to choose work such as herding goats. Ahlam secretly phoned Mahmoud from an abandoned Shia village where roughly 40 Yazidis were confined; escape attempts were punished by torture and public dragging of bodies. After ISIS removed the elderly from their house, Ahlam and others fled at midnight and reached Kurdistan, reuniting her family after eight months, though her own parents remain captive.  

Days later ISIS unexpectedly freed 217 Yazidis—mostly elderly people, plus 60 children—including Mahmoud’s parents; Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil believes the group was released because ISIS could no longer care for them. Heading to the United Nations with Iraq’s prime minister, Dakhil is urging greater international action and airstrikes, saying many Yazidi women would have preferred death to kidnapping and rape."
15779,"American educator Debra Lobo, a 55-year-old California native and vice-principal of Karachi’s Jinnah Medical and Dental College, was shot Thursday while driving from work to pick up her two daughters. Two men on a motorcycle fired at her, hitting her in the right cheek and left arm; she is unconscious but expected to survive and is being treated at Aga Khan Hospital. Police recovered Urdu pamphlets in her car saying “America should be burnt.” Lobo, who has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Pakistani Christian librarian, is the focus of an investigation by Karachi police, while the U.S. Consulate is coordinating with local authorities."
15786,"• A Delaware family fell violently ill while staying in a rented villa at the Sirenusa resort in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands.  
• Timeline: The family began renting the villa on March 14; paramedics were called March 20 after Steve Esmond was found unconscious and his wife, Theresa Devine, and their sons (16 and 14) suffered seizures.  
• Current medical status: The boys remain in critical condition and are in comas; their father is conscious but unable to move; the mother has been released and is in occupational therapy.  
• Cause under investigation: Preliminary EPA tests found methyl bromide—an acutely toxic, indoor-prohibited pesticide—in the unit. The villa directly beneath theirs had been fumigated for pests on March 18 by Terminix, hired by Sea Glass Vacations.  
• Investigations: The EPA is conducting environmental tests, and the U.S. Department of Justice has opened a criminal inquiry. Terminix says it is cooperating with authorities."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) has formally banned member participation in executions, asserting that such involvement conflicts with pharmacists’ roles as healthcare providers. This new policy strengthens earlier APhA stances opposing (1) calling lethal-injection chemicals “drugs” and (2) any laws compelling or forbidding pharmacists to assist in executions. Prompted by heightened scrutiny after problematic lethal injections—such as Clayton Lockett’s prolonged 2014 death and recent postponements in Oklahoma and Georgia—the vote comes amid nationwide drug shortages: manufacturers like Lundbeck stopped supplying the preferred drug pentobarbital in 2011, and Texas now reports dwindling stock, pushing states toward compounded versions. While 32 states still permit capital punishment and Utah recently revived firing squads, APhA insists pharmacists avoid preparing execution chemicals or otherwise participating, bringing its stance in line with bodies such as the American Medical Association, American Nurses Association, and American Board of Anesthesiology."
15791,"A Howard University medical-school roundtable held during National Public Health Week framed climate change as an immediate public-health threat rather than an abstract environmental issue. President Obama, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and EPA chief Gina McCarthy stressed that warming-related problems such as asthma, heat stress, malaria, diarrhea and under-nutrition are already harming Americans and will worsen if emissions continue. Murthy recounted a family loss to asthma; adviser Brian Deese cited a survey in which 70 % of doctors report seeing climate-linked illnesses rise.  

EPA notes that health effects will vary by region, age, wealth and public-health capacity, while WHO projects 250,000 additional climate-related deaths each year from 2030-2050; air pollution alone killed 7 million people in 2012. Children, the elderly and developing nations are most at risk. Despite a 1.4 °F global temperature rise (and another 2 °F expected this century), only 55 % of Americans in a Gallup poll believe warming’s effects are occurring.  

Obama argued that past Clean Air Act successes show solutions are affordable; new open data and apps from firms like Google and Microsoft could let families track local air quality, galvanizing public pressure for stronger climate action."
15800,"Cyclist Wang Pingan has spent 460 days riding 29,200 km through every major Chinese province on a heavily laden mountain bike. Just before finishing, the bike was stolen in Shenzhen while he briefly shopped in Huaqiangbei. Despite slim odds, police used surveillance footage to trace and recover the bicycle—already resold twice—and arrested a suspect, wanting Wang to leave Shenzhen with good memories. Wang, a recent graduate traveling on roughly $100, had refused replacement offers, calling the bike his “old lover” and vowing to walk without it. With the bike returned, he can complete the final leg to Hainan Island, adding it to earlier extremes such as Mohe, Urumqi and Xishuangbanna."
15817,"• Tens of thousands of migrants from more than 20 nations are now using Libya as the main “funnel” to Europe; in 2014 more than 80 % of all Mediterranean-bound travelers converged on the Libyan coast.  

Main groups and motives  
• Eritreans: flee authoritarian rule, poverty and open-ended military service; many pay several thousand dollars and move via Sudan.  
• Somalis: escape Al-Shabaab, clan warfare and deep poverty; one youth warned relatives the trip is “95 %” fatal.  
• Syrians: after years in neighboring states, many have abandoned hope of return and try the Libyan route.  
• West Africans (Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Gambia, Nigeria and others): mostly young men pushed by unemployment, shrinking farmland or Boko Haram violence and drawn by tales of success abroad.  

Routes and hubs  
• Established smuggling corridors run from the Horn of Africa, through Khartoum, Agadez (Niger), Tamanrasset (Algeria) and on to Sabha, Qatrun or Tripoli.  
• A ride from Agadez to southern Libya can cost up to $300; an Eritrean woman paid $5,000 to reach the Mediterranean.  
• Smugglers operate in small, shifting groups; migrants are handed from one to the next and often face kidnap, robbery, starvation or death in the desert.  

Conditions and trends  
• Libya’s chaos leaves borders and coastline largely unguarded, encouraging departures but exposing migrants to militias, tribal feuds and ISIS violence.  
• Smuggling has become more organized and expensive, with Syrians able to buy “packages” and sit on deck while poorer Africans are locked below or put in rubber dinghies.  
• Trafficking of African women for prostitution to Italy tripled in 2014.  
• Thousands already working in Libya now flee escalating abuses; other Mediterranean and North-African states are fortifying borders but flows continue.

Result: a sharp, multi-national surge toward Europe driven far more by “push” factors—war, repression and economic collapse—than by Europe’s “pull.”"
11317,"Several states proposed “religious-freedom” bills criticized as enabling discrimination against gay and lesbian people. A broad array of business and sports leaders spoke out, but Walmart’s stance drew the most attention. Minutes after CEO Doug McMillon asked Arkansas’s Republican governor Asa Hutchinson to veto such a bill, Hutchinson said he would not sign it without changes, marking a victory for Walmart.

The retailer’s activism—coming soon after its decision to raise wages for 500,000 workers—highlights its role as a political bellwether. Former GOP governor Tim Pawlenty urged Republicans to note the shift and back policies aiding middle-income workers and banning LGBT discrimination.

Walmart’s political giving, once heavily tilted to Republicans, has moved closer to parity, and its workplace policies have grown more LGBT-inclusive since 2011. Retail analysts say this reflects both its diverse customer base and rising national support for gay rights.

Business backlash was nationwide: Apple, the NCAA, Angie’s List, NASCAR and others warned Indiana and Arkansas about economic consequences. The controversy has spilled into 2016 politics, with Jeb Bush softening his initial support for Indiana’s law, Ted Cruz defending it, and Hillary Clinton urging a veto in Arkansas. Overall, corporations are signaling that equality is “good for business” while discrimination is not."
11323,"Easter commemorates Christ’s Crucifixion (atonement) on Good Friday and Resurrection (victory over death) on Sunday.  

Date:  
• Set by the Council of Nicaea (325) as the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox; if that full moon is a Sunday, Easter moves one week later.  
• Because the Western Church adopted the Gregorian calendar and the Eastern Church kept the Julian, most years have two different Easter dates; Orthodox Easter in the Holy Land arrives a week after the Western observance.  
• Its link to the lunar cycle also ties it to Passover and explains phenomena such as the “blood moon” that appeared between Good Friday and Easter Sunday.

Current celebrations:  
• At the Vatican, Holy Week ran from Palm Sunday through Easter Mass; Pope Francis led outdoor services in the rain, washed believers’ feet, and in his Urbi et Orbi plea urged aid for suffering people in places like Nigeria, South Sudan, Iraq and Ukraine.  
• In Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Catholics and Armenians marked Easter with Mass and procession; Orthodox Christians will celebrate later.

Traditions:  
• Eggs and the bunny are post-Medieval additions. The first recorded reference (1682, Georg Franck von Frankenau) describes an Alsace custom involving a rabbit and Easter eggs; German immigrants introduced the bunny to North America in the 1700s.  
• A likely origin: eggs accumulated during Lent’s egg-free fast were boiled, colored, hidden and given away, with the bunny invented to amuse children about their source.

Tip: For odor-free egg coloring, replace vinegar dye with a packet of Kool-Aid dissolved in hot water—bright results but strong staining."
11332,"Former pro-wrestler and current Upper House lawmaker Antonio Inoki asked Japan’s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani whether the Air Self-Defense Force had ever scrambled jets or conducted research in response to extraterrestrial UFOs. Nakatani told parliament that while fighters are launched when unidentified objects threaten Japan’s airspace, the ASDF has never encountered any craft believed to originate beyond Earth—only birds or other earthly objects. Inoki, who says he once saw a UFO, raised the query during a budget committee session. The exchange recalls a 2007 discussion by another defense minister about the legal implications of an alien attack under Japan’s pacifist constitution."
11349,"Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old Indiana basketball player diagnosed with the inoperable brain tumor diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013, died early Friday. Determined to realize her dream of playing college basketball, she joined Mount St. Joseph University, which received NCAA approval to move up its 2014–15 opener so she could play; before a sell-out crowd she scored both the game’s first basket and its final layup. Hill’s story drew international attention and tributes, including from head coach Dan Benjamin, university President Tony Artez, high-school principal Bill Snyder, NBA star LeBron James, and NCAA President Mark Emmert. Embracing the motto “Never Give Up,” she urged others to cherish each moment and “fight for others.” Partnering with the nonprofit The Cure Starts Now, she helped raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research. Mourners remembered her as an “unselfish angel” whose tenacity and positivity left a lasting legacy."
11353,"A 20–30-foot fiberglass boat fragment, believed to be debris from Japan’s March 11, 2011 earthquake-tsunami, was found off the Oregon coast and towed to Newport marina. Inside, officials discovered yellowtail jack fish native to Japanese waters. Biologists judged the risk of invasive species to be minimal. The boat debris will be dried, further inspected, and sent to a landfill, while the fish will be relocated to the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Richie Benaud, former Australian cricket captain and celebrated broadcaster, has died aged 84 after treatment for skin cancer. A leg-spinner who played 64 Tests, he captained Australia from 1958/59 to 1963/64 without losing a series, achieved the first Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets, and led the 1959/60 tour of India and Pakistan. Inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985, he became globally famous over more than four decades as a BBC commentator, renowned for sharp one-liners. Tributes came from figures such as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, current captain Michael Clarke, Shane Warne, Pakistan’s Imran Khan, Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara, and UK Prime Minister David Cameron, recognizing Benaud as an iconic player, voice of cricket, and gentleman."
11356,"NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer, who discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, has officially named it “316201 Malala (2010 ML48)” to honor Pakistani education activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai. Citing the lack of celestial bodies named for women—especially women of color—Mainzer attached Malala’s name to the roughly 4-km-wide, dark-surfaced asteroid, which orbits between Mars and Jupiter every 5½ years. Mainzer said the tribute aligns with Malala’s mission, noting that educating girls expands the global pool of talent needed to tackle humanity’s toughest challenges."
11366,"A woman left an explosives-filled handbag beside a bus at Gombe’s Bauchi Motor Park around 8:30 p.m. Thursday. The device detonated as the Jos-bound bus was loading, igniting the vehicle and killing at least five people while seriously injuring more than a dozen (some lost limbs or an eye). Witnesses Adamu Saidu and Falalu Tasiu described the woman’s actions and the aftermath. No group has claimed responsibility, but Boko Haram—recently pressured by regional military offensives and increasingly targeting bus stations, markets and schools—is the main suspect. It is the first such attack since Nigeria’s weekend presidential election won by Muhammadu Buhari, who has pledged to crush Boko Haram when he takes office in late May."
11370,"At the Panama Summit of the Americas, the headline moment was the first-ever handshake between U.S. President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro, symbolizing the start of normalized relations. Obama wants the meeting to mark a broader U.S. re-engagement with Latin America, where Washington has recently ceded influence to China, Russia and Iran. Past hemispheric summits hurt U.S. standing—e.g., the 2009 Hugo Chávez book stunt and the 2012 Cartagena Secret Service scandal—so avoiding new missteps is vital. Unlike the last summit, Cuba is now included, easing a prior regional grievance, yet new U.S. sanctions on Venezuela risk giving President Nicolás Maduro anti-U.S. ammunition. The region is struggling with eroding democratic norms, corruption and poverty, but still desires prosperity, democracy and rule of law—values the U.S. can champion. If Obama couples his Cuba opening with clear support for human rights (underscored by meeting Cuban dissidents) and an appealing economic vision, he can begin restoring American influence and leave a legacy that extends beyond a single handshake."
11384,"A woman recalls being groped on a crowded Mumbai train at 13 and remaining silent for 25 years, an experience that sparked her later work against sexual harassment. She notes harassment on Indian streets, transport and workplaces ranges from groping to lewd stares, yet is widely minimized. Data cited: 80 % of Mumbai women have faced street harassment (We the People study); in her own 2,000-woman workshops almost all had been harassed and fewer than 10 had ever reported it; globally, 1 in 3 women experience sexual violence (U.N. Women). Social shame, fear of police mishandling and family “disrepute” deter reporting despite existing laws. Two recent cases—allegations against climate-chief Rajendra Pachauri and media boss Tarun Tejpal—show that speaking out, even against powerful men, can yield consequences. The author urges women to break their silence, use legal protections, and enlist supportive allies, arguing that tolerating harassment confines and disempowers women."
11395,"After the 2014 Khumbu Icefall avalanche that killed 16 Nepali Sherpas and halted the season, climbers have returned to Everest. Nepal issued 347 permits for 2015 (including 125 carried over), slightly up from last year, while 320 people have registered for the northern Chinese route—136 more than in 2014. To reduce danger, a Sherpa-run committee restored the longer, central route through the Icefall, requiring more ladder crossings but avoiding last year’s avalanche zone; load limits on workers’ gear were also advised. Some operators, such as Alpenglow Expeditions, have abandoned the Nepal side for China, citing rising risk. The shift worries Nepali companies that depend on Everest tourism, and many Sherpas are returning to work despite family anxieties. Climbers like Jon Reiter are also coming back, drawn by the mountain despite last year’s tragedy."
11400,"The author notes a growing push for Americans to order medical tests on themselves: Mark Cuban urges quarterly “all-inclusive” blood draws, Taylor Swift promotes screening, and Arizona now permits any lab test without a doctor’s order. Commercial labs and franchises are springing up to serve this do-it-yourself market. The piece argues that, for people who feel well, widespread self-testing will chiefly produce more “abnormal” results that are normal variants, leading to doctor visits, extra tests, anxiety, unnecessary procedures, overtreatment, complications, and higher costs—with few real health benefits. Examples include mass whole-body CT scans and South Korea’s 15-fold rise in thyroid cancer surgery after ultrasound screening. Although diagnostic tests are valuable for clear medical problems, routine testing of the healthy seldom makes them healthier. The writer does not call for a ban but urges FDA regulation of “snake-oil” tests and public education about the limited value—and potential harm—of indiscriminate self-testing."
11410,"Canada has expanded its anti-ISIS mission from Iraq into Syria. On Tuesday, CF-18 Hornets carried out Canada’s first Syrian airstrike, hitting an ISIS garrison near Raqqa; the Defence Department calls the strike successful and reports all aircraft returned safely, with casualties unknown. Prime Minister Harper approved the Syria mandate last month, and Defence Minister Jason Kenney says it shows Canada’s resolve to deny ISIS safe haven. Canada remains part of the broader U.S.-led coalition that has been attacking ISIS in Iraq since August and in Syria since September, with several other Western and Middle Eastern partners involved."

• They are reported as the first all-female quintuplets born worldwide since 1969; Danielle and Adam Busby, already parents to Blayke, share updates on their blog “It’s a Buzz World.”  
• A reader noted a previous U.S. case: all-girl quintuplets born in 1959 in San Antonio, who died within 24 hours.  
• Separately, Sharon and Korey Rademacher of Pensacola secretly carried twins; relatives learned only at West Florida Hospital after the March 11 birth of Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith. Their reaction video has surpassed 700,000 YouTube views."
11779,"• In response to a June 2014 federal court ruling that the no-fly list redress process violated due-process rights, the U.S. Justice Department has issued a revised policy.

• U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents denied boarding can now:
  – Be told if they are on the no-fly list when they apply through DHS TRIP.  
  – Request a second, more detailed notice specifying the criterion used to place them on the list (in unclassified form when feasible).  
  – Submit written arguments and evidence to contest their status and receive a final written decision from the TSA.

• The change stems from an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of 13 Americans, but the ACLU says the new procedure still withholds meaningful notice, evidence, and a live hearing, so it plans to challenge it again.

• The no-fly list, run by the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, remains classified; in 2012 it reportedly contained about 21,000 names, including roughly 500 Americans.

• Previously, those who inquired only received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion."
11791,"Texas veterinarian Dr. Kristen Lindsey posted a Facebook photo of herself holding an orange cat she had killed with a bow-and-arrow, boasting, “My first bow kill… Vet of the year award … Gladly accepted.” The image ignited widespread outrage: callers flooded Washington County Animal Clinic (her employer), crashed its website, and contacted local police and animal control. Though Lindsey first claimed she would not be fired, the clinic promptly dismissed her, covered her name on its sign, and condemned her actions. An investigation by the Austin County sheriff’s office is under way; potential charges are possible. Animal advocates say the cat may have been a pet named “Tiger” and not a feral tom, and Alley Cat Allies is offering a $7,500 reward for evidence leading to arrest and conviction. While activists demand punishment, a few clients publicly expressed support for Lindsey."
11795,"Video from CNN affiliate WMAR shows an unidentified Baltimore mother yanking her masked son from riot crowds after spotting him on TV throwing rocks at police. She smacks his head, yells for him to “get the f--- over here,” and forces him to remove his mask. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts publicly praised her actions, saying he wished more parents would take similar control of their children during the unrest."
11808,"A CNN team reached Ravi Opi village, 30 km east of Kathmandu, where Saturday’s earthquake has splintered the main highway and turned the two-hour drive into a slow, hazardous trip. In the village a local official says about 90 % of houses are now uninhabitable; residents fear aftershocks and are living in improvised shelters with almost no outside aid.  

Individual stories underline the destruction:  
• Maili Tamang, 62, was injured escaping the collapse of the two-story home she built with her late husband.  
• Mahesh Koiraba, 31, dug through the rubble of his house to find his two-year-old daughter Prati dead.  

People have begun clearing small landslides and returning to their fields, but rain and recurring tremors are hampering recovery. Villagers such as Osminda Koirale report that no government help has reached them, highlighting the larger concern that even more isolated areas—reachable only on foot—may be suffering unseen devastation. The report was filed by Arwa Damon in Kavre District and written by Euan McKirdy from Hong Kong."
11817,"On “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” Jeremy Renner—appearing in character as Marvel’s Hawkeye—performed a comedic, piano-backed parody of Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud.” In the song he jokes that, beyond archery, his “powers” include owning many scarves and berets, playing trombone, and opening pickle jars. The segment, highlighted by Billboard, also notes Renner’s broader film successes, including both “Avengers” movies, “The Hurt Locker,” “American Hustle,” and entries in the “Bourne” and “Mission Impossible” franchises."
11821,"Director Bryan Singer announced on Instagram that Olivia Munn will portray the telepathic mutant Psylocke (Betsy Braddock) in “X-Men: Apocalypse,” the sequel to “X-Men: Days of Future Past.” The film, now in production, is slated for a May 27, 2016 theatrical release. Munn joins cast members James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and the recently added Jubilee. Psylocke, created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe, debuted in Captain Britain comics and became an X-Men regular in 1987’s “Uncanny X-Men” #213. Munn is represented by Creative Artists Agency and Atlas Artists."
11826,"Stephen Hawking has teamed with Monty Python to release a new version of the 1983 “Galaxy Song” for Record Store Day, issuing it as a 7-inch single with a downloadable track. The accompanying video shows scientist Brian Cox criticizing the song’s scientific accuracy until Hawking arrives, topples Cox with his wheelchair, sings the tune in his computerized voice, and soars into space. The skit originates from material used in Monty Python’s live shows. Written by Eric Idle and John Du Prez, the “Galaxy Song” is billed by the troupe as an amusing, information-packed lecture on the universe. Hawking, who has also appeared on Pink Floyd’s “Talkin’ Hawkin’,” is thus trying his hand at musical comedy alongside his previous TV cameos."
11838,"The author recalls being 12 at a 1980 Miami protest over the police acquittal in Arthur McDuffie’s death and watching it turn into a riot, then connects that scene to Baltimore 2015 and a long pattern of U.S. race riots sparked by perceived police injustice—Harlem 1964, Watts 1965, Newark and Detroit 1967, Los Angeles 1992. Moderating a recent panel titled “Riot—The Voice of the Unheard?” (held in conjunction with the play “Detroit ’67”), the author learned that rioters often act from hopelessness; that 1960s unrest, though violent, prodded officials toward reform; and that commissions such as Kerner (1968) and Christopher (1992) traced riots to racism, poverty, joblessness, poor housing, and police abuse. Quoting Martin Luther King Jr., the piece notes that riots grab attention but can derail just causes, whereas sustained non-violent protest—illustrated by Ferguson after Michael Brown—wins change without destruction. It concludes that today’s challenge is to confront the underlying conditions while steering angry youth, as leaders like Rev. Jamal Bryant are trying to do, toward the proven power of non-violence."
11839,"Israel’s military says it carried out airstrikes Sunday night in the occupied Golan Heights after four militants crossed from Syria and attempted to plant an explosive device near the border. The strikes thwarted the bombing; Israeli media report three of the attackers were killed. The militants’ affiliation is unknown. The Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967 and later annexed by Israel, is internationally regarded as occupied territory and is home to about 41,000 Jews, Druze, and Alawites."
11840,"A logic puzzle, dubbed “Cheryl’s Birthday,” went viral after Singapore TV host Kenneth Kong shared it on Facebook. Originally set for top competitors in the 8 April Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad, the problem asks solvers to deduce Cheryl’s birthday from ten possible dates—May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, or August 17—based on a short, truthful conversation between her friends Albert and Bernard. The viral debate over the correct date has been likened to the “What color is the dress” controversy; solutions and explanations have been provided by outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Georgia Tech mathematician Matt Baker, while many others online have offered their own answers."
11858,"A severe HIV outbreak that began in mid-December is sweeping rural Scott and Jackson counties, Indiana, and is linked to intravenous abuse of the prescription opioid Opana. As of Friday, 142 people (136 confirmed, six preliminarily positive) have tested positive—an extraordinary figure for sparsely populated areas with only one non-specialist infectious-disease doctor. The CDC and Indiana health officials have declared a public-health emergency, opened a once-weekly volunteer clinic (so far 33 patients), conducted door-to-door education, and instituted a 30-day needle-exchange order that has just been extended. Frequent needle sharing—fueled by Opana’s need for 4–10 injections per day and its large-gauge needles—plus widespread prescription-drug abuse in economically stagnant Ohio River communities has accelerated transmission. Officials warn the episode, mirrored by a 150 % rise in hepatitis C (2010–2013), shows how quickly HIV and other blood-borne diseases can resurge without vigilant prevention."
11860,"Singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell has been in UCLA Medical Center for about a month after being found unconscious at home. On April 28, her friend of 44 years, Leslie Morris, filed a court petition to become Mitchell’s conservator, stating Mitchell is unconscious and unable to care for herself. The same day, a statement on Mitchell’s website—approved by Morris—said she is alert, comprehends, and is expected to recover fully; publicist Alisse Kingsley affirms the website’s version. A doctor’s declaration says Mitchell will probably be unable to attend court hearings for four to six months. Fans are posting tributes at WeLoveYouJoni.com."
11870,"Hillary Clinton’s campaign expects renewed scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest tied to foreign and corporate donations to Clinton-run charities, attention that will intensify with the May 5 release of Peter Schweizer’s book “Clinton Cash.”  Critics point to:

• Large 2014 gifts to the Clinton Foundation from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Canada’s foreign-affairs department, the last of which was pushing the Keystone XL pipeline scrutinized by Clinton’s State Department.  
• At least six banks under investigation that nevertheless sponsored Clinton Global Initiative events.  

While such ties raise ethical questions, no conclusive evidence of quid-pro-quo has emerged, and polls show voters focus more on jobs, schools and taxes.  The foundations’ internal problems—chronic deficits, uncontrolled expansion, and episodes like con-man Raffaello Follieri’s unfulfilled $50 million pledge—underscore managerial weaknesses already known to the public.

Clinton’s likely response is more time on the road with casual voter meetings, shifting attention from these “distractions.”  Unless the forthcoming book reveals new, decisive proof, the charity and email controversies are expected to remain secondary issues, with 57 % of likely voters still predicting a Clinton victory."
11875,"Andrew Lesnie, a Sydney-born cinematographer famed for his long partnership with Peter Jackson, died of a heart attack at 59. He shot all six Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films, plus Jackson’s King Kong (2005) and The Lovely Bones (2009), winning an Oscar for The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) after impressing Jackson with his work on Babe and its sequel. Lesnie’s credits also include I Am Legend (2007), The Last Airbender (2010), Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), Healing (2014), and Russell Crowe’s just-released directing debut The Water Diviner, prompting Crowe to call him “the master of the light.” Inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002, Lesnie trained at TAFE and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, began at the Australian Broadcasting Corp., and honed his craft on shorts, music videos, documentaries, features, commercials, and the children’s show Wonder World."
11877,"• In 2014, ambushes were the leading cause of felonious law-enforcement deaths for the fifth straight year.  
• Google’s Waze traffic app crowdsources real-time data—including a “traffic cop” feature that lets its 50 million users mark officers’ locations as “visible” or “invisible.”  
• Law-enforcement groups argue this feature endangers police by helping criminals, drunk drivers, speeders, gang members, and even terrorists track or avoid officers; New York police killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley reportedly used Waze that way before murdering two officers.  
• Despite Google’s claim that Waze serves the “common good,” officers say risks eclipse benefits and criticize Google for refusing to meet with the National Sheriffs’ Association to discuss the issue.  
• They urge Google to collaborate so traffic assistance and officer safety can coexist."
11888,"Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe created the project “Toy Soldiers” to challenge viewers’ desensitization to war images. In a five-week shoot in Western Sahara—a little-reported region disputed between Morocco and the Polisario Front since the mid-1970s—he posed 50–60 Polisario soldiers at historic battle sites to look like green plastic toy figurines. The landscape-photography specialist secured military clearance, avoided UN involvement by limiting troop numbers, and had soldiers build oil-drum platforms. Thorpe’s visual metaphor invites audiences to reconsider their emotional and political reactions when they realize the “toys” are real fighters. He also highlights the conflict’s ongoing stalemate since a 1991 ceasefire and the population’s split between Moroccan-held territory and Algerian refugee camps. The work questions how future war imagery will be consumed and is being released as a book through Dewi Lewis Publishing."

• Suspect: 20-year-old former student and ex-employee Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, described as “armed and dangerous” and still at large.  
• Authorities call the attack “isolated,” not random; tear gas used during the search inadvertently hit a non-suspect in a restroom.

• Deputy Anbar Council head Falih Essawi, speaking from a front-line position, says government defenses are “collapsing rapidly,” fears the city could fall within hours, and pleads for Iraqi reinforcements and U.S.-led air support.  
• Fighting Wednesday left at least 10 Iraqi security personnel dead and more than 100 wounded.  
• ISIS has advanced from several directions: it already controls areas north and south of Ramadi, took Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem and parts of Soufia to the east, and is pushing into the city center; only western approaches remain with government forces and are threatened.  
• The offensive has triggered a mass exodus: Essawi estimates 150,000 people fled Wednesday, clogging roads; refugees describe Iraqi troops retreating and ISIS quickly occupying neighborhoods.  
• Ramadi has been contested for months despite repeated U.S. airstrikes (seven since Monday); a U.S. official insists the city’s fall is “not imminent,” but Essawi disputes this.  
• Essawi’s appeals follow Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s visit to Washington to seek additional aid against ISIS."
11932,"• Equal Pay Day (April 14) marks how long into 2015 women had to work to match men’s 2014 earnings; women earn about 77 ¢ per male dollar, and the gap is wider for women of color.  
• Over 40 years the average woman loses roughly $431,000; closing the gap could lift half of single working mothers from poverty and boost consumer spending.  
• A commentator urges Hillary Clinton, newly launched as a populist presidential candidate, to dramatize the issue by pledging a 23 % cut to the $400,000 presidential salary—refusing a raise until pay equity is achieved—to signal solidarity with working women.  
• Although such a gesture would be a “political stunt,” the piece argues it suits today’s image-driven politics, would spotlight nationwide inequity (seen even in hacked Sony pay data), and could counter perceptions that wealthy, establishment-tied Clinton is out of touch.  
• The article concludes that while symbolism is theatrical, it can advance a noble cause, and Clinton’s historic candidacy will matter most if it actually improves life for America’s 158 million women."
11945,"The passage explains that today’s jihadist groups—especially ISIS and its Nigerian affiliate Boko Haram—treat captured women not just as battlefield spoils but as central components of a larger plan to build a Sharia-based “caliphate.”  

Key points  
• ISIS and Boko Haram systematize rape, sexual slavery and forced marriage: Yazidi girls are auctioned in “slave warehouses,” and Boko Haram has kidnapped about 2,000 females since 2014, including the 276 Chibok students.  
• Human Rights Watch calls ISIS’s practices “organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage,” amounting to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity.  
• Unlike al-Qaeda under Osama bin Laden, which saw a caliphate as a distant goal, ISIS seeks to build society now; therefore it needs women for domestic labor, reproduction and community life, even while treating them as property.  
• Targeting female students and non-Muslims (e.g., Yazidis) serves multiple aims: rewarding fighters, humiliating enemies, enforcing conversions, and embedding women into daily life under strict, oppressive rules that drive some to suicide.  
• The groups justify these acts as Islamic law and proclaim intentions to enslave non-Muslim women, emphasizing that their brutality toward women is calculated “madness with a method” intended to cement the social order they envision."
11948,"SpaceX delayed Monday’s launch because of weather and will try again Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral. The two-stage Falcon 9 will send an uncrewed Dragon capsule with about 4,300 lb of supplies (research gear and an espresso maker) to the International Space Station. After liftoff, SpaceX will attempt—again—to land the Falcon 9’s first stage upright on an autonomous drone ship in the Atlantic; a January try ended in an explosive crash, and success is estimated at 50%. Reusable boosters could cut launch costs drastically. Dragon is to dock with the ISS, remain about five weeks while astronauts unload and reload it with over 3,000 lb of return cargo, then splash down in the Pacific. This is SpaceX’s sixth ISS resupply mission and it was the first private firm to dock there."
11979,"• After weeks of graphic testimony, jurors in the Boston Marathon bombing trial deliberated for seven hours Tuesday without reaching a verdict and will resume Wednesday; they submitted two questions to the judge.  
• Defendant: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, faces 30 federal counts (17 punishable by death or life) for the April 15, 2013 attacks; conviction on any capital count would trigger a penalty phase.  
• Prosecution case (92 witnesses):  
  – Argues the brothers were “partners in crime” who chose Patriots’ Day to “terrorize this country.”  
  – Presents videos, photos and eyewitness accounts of two pressure-cooker bombs that killed Martin Richard (8), Krystle Campbell (29) and Lingzi Lu (23) and maimed scores, plus evidence of the later killing of MIT officer Sean Collier.  
  – Details Tamerlan setting the first bomb, Dzhokhar the second; shows Dzhokhar’s post-attack nonchalance and a boat-hideout “manifesto” praising jihad.  
• Defense case (4 witnesses): concedes Dzhokhar’s involvement but contends he was a 19-year-old under the domination of his radicalized older brother Tamerlan, who orchestrated the plot and was killed during the Watertown shoot-out.  
• Emotional courtroom moments included survivors’ testimony, gruesome injury descriptions, and videos of the blasts; families wept while Tsarnaev mostly fidgeted at counsel table."
12008,"The article explores whether America is heading toward a “marriage apocalypse,” focusing on millennial attitudes. A CNN commentator interviewed Kent State journalism students who said career goals, travel and freedom outweigh traditional timelines for marriage; they would marry only “if and when” it feels right, and debt makes weddings unappealing. Their stance arises amid widespread divorce: 42 million U.S. adults have married more than once, up from 14 million in 1960; 23 % of currently married adults are on at least a second union. A Pew study shows half of Americans—and two-thirds of 18- to 29-year-olds—believe society fares just as well when people focus on pursuits other than marriage and children. Economists note marriage often aligns with greater economic well-being, though causality is unclear. Scandinavian trends illustrate an alternative: in Norway 82 % of couples have their first child outside wedlock, marriage offers few legal or social advantages, and quality-of-life rankings remain high. Swedish interviewees say marriage should stem from love, not pressure. The author, once anti-marriage but wed at 38, wonders whether a largely single society would actually suffer, leaving the question open to readers."
12060,"Iraqi troops, supported by about 20,000 Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen and preceded by U.S.-led airstrikes, seized control of Tikrit on Wednesday after multiple earlier failed attempts. While ISIS fighters have largely been driven out, Iraqi forces are still clearing the city of threats: vehicles and buildings rigged with explosives, hundreds of dismantled IEDs, and scattered militants hiding in houses. Officials worry that possible militia reprisals against Tikrit’s Sunni population—linked to ISIS’ massacre of more than 1,500 Shiite cadets last year—could reignite sectarian tension. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, visiting the city, declared ISIS “defeated” and said full control was imminent; victory here is viewed as a springboard for an upcoming offensive to retake Mosul."
12068,"The International Committee of the Red Cross urged a 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen—especially around Aden—to let food, water, medical supplies and staff reach civilians and the recently wounded, warning many will die within hours without help. Fighting pits Shiite Houthi rebels against a Saudi-led Arab coalition backing displaced Sunni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Saudi airstrikes—the heaviest yet—hit military sites in Sanaa, while coalition special forces and arms aid Hadi loyalists in Aden. The U.N. Security Council discussed a Russian draft resolution to halt the airstrikes, but adjourned without agreement; the text omits demands for Houthi withdrawal or political talks. The UN reports at least 519 dead, 1,700 wounded nationwide in two weeks; tens of thousands have fled abroad, and recent Aden clashes killed 58 more. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula controls parts of eastern Yemen; militants freed senior leader Khaled Batarfi during a prison break. France evacuated 44 people from Balhaf."
12073,"Detective Patrick Cherry, a New York Police Department officer assigned to the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, was filmed berating an Uber driver Monday after the driver signaled for him to use a turn signal. The video, recorded by passenger Sanjay Seth and posted to YouTube, shows Cherry cursing, mocking the driver’s accent, and threatening arrest while claiming the driver committed traffic violations. After the clip went viral, Police Commissioner William Bratton called the conduct “unacceptable,” placed Cherry on modified assignment, and began an Internal Affairs investigation; Cherry could face suspension, reassignment, or loss of his top-secret clearance. Cherry publicly apologized to the driver and to Bratton on Friday, saying he had been “angry.” Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized the language used, while Detectives’ Endowment Association president Michael Palladino urged people not to judge Cherry solely by the incident. The Civilian Complaint Review Board is also reviewing the case, and Uber said it is supporting the driver."

• The taxable maximum—earnings subject to Social Security tax—will climb from $160,200 to $168,600.  
• The COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers; notices will reach beneficiaries in early December, and they can view them sooner through My Social Security accounts.  
• The 3.2% increase is below 2023’s 8.7% COLA but above the 20-year average of 2.6%."

13816,"Xanax (alprazolam) is a benzodiazepine that lessens anxiety by boosting GABA activity in the brain. It acts quickly, making it useful for short-term or emergency relief of acute anxiety. However, prolonged use can lead to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal risks, often requiring higher doses for the same effect. For chronic anxiety, therapies, lifestyle changes, or alternative medications are usually more sustainable, and any extended Xanax use demands close medical supervision. A balanced, multi-strategy approach under professional guidance is recommended for long-term anxiety management."
13823,"• The Pentagon is sending 900 U.S. troops to the Middle East after at least 16 recent drone- and rocket-related attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria, which caused 21 minor injuries (mostly traumatic brain injuries).  
• Deploying units include:  
  – Soldiers from Fort Cavazos (Killeen, TX) and Fort Bliss (El Paso, TX) who will form air-defense headquarters elements.  
  – Additional Fort Bliss soldiers who will operate a THAAD battery (about 100 personnel typically required).  
  – Patriot batteries from Fort Sill, OK, and Patriot and Avenger batteries from Fort Liberty, NC.

13827,"New HoH Bowie Jane is under pressure to backdoor Cameron Hardin, whom most houseguests view as a major competitive threat. Despite this, she has nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields, content if either leaves.  

Key dynamics:  
• Alliance “The Fugitives” (Matt Klotz, Jag Bains, Cameron) exists, yet Jag still wants Cameron out.  
• Cameron urges Bowie to instead backdoor Cory Wurtenberger; Bowie agrees Cory is dangerous but hesitates to act.  
• Cory, for his part, lobbies Bowie to target Cameron, but she has told him she’s not inclined to do so.

Power of Veto details: players are Bowie, Felicia, Cirie, Jag, Matt, and America Lopez, with Cory hosting.  
– If Bowie, Jag, or Matt wins POV, nominations remain.  
– If America, Cirie, or Felicia wins, Bowie must name a replacement and could choose Cory.

The upcoming POV competition will determine whether Bowie ultimately targets Cory, Cameron, or leaves her current nominees intact."
13829,"After Cameron Hardin was unanimously backdoored in Week 10 for repeatedly winning challenges and clashing with others, a secret Head of Household competition followed. Jag Bains won the “BB Comics” challenge, became the Invisible HOH, and quietly nominated Blue Kim and Felicia Cannon. Blue, Felicia, and Cirie Fields soon regretted Cameron’s eviction, noting he had at least been transparent and that his warning—Blue would be the next target—materialized within a day. Week 11 will feature a Double Veto that could reshape the game, while Cameron settles into jury, Michael Bruner from BB24 celebrates his wedding, and Big Brother 25 continues airing three nights a week on CBS."
13834,"Week 10 highlights:  
• Bowie Jane won her first competition to become Head of Household.  
• She nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields, still upset with them from earlier in the season.  
• Jag Bains captured the Power of Veto during the OTEV challenge.  
• Jag plans to use the Veto; Bowie intends to replace the saved nominee with Cameron Hardin, creating a backdoor move that would make Cameron the season’s first jury member if the vote holds.  
• The Veto Meeting is set for Monday, October 9, and tension is rising: Felicia says Bowie threw the comp, Cirie says America did, and various houseguests are feeding Bowie questionable stories about Cameron while Matt ignores Cameron’s warnings about Cirie.  
• Bowie now seems to view Jag and Matt as her main allies, setting the stage for eventful upcoming episodes."

George Santos after 23 new federal charges accused Santos of crimes such as unauthorized use of donors’ credit cards and identity theft; Santos was already known for allegedly fabricating much of his résumé. The House must vote this week, but Santos says he will not resign. Republican leaders, protecting their slim 221-212 majority, could instead table or send the measure to committee, and any expulsion would still require 290 votes—meaning 78 Republicans would have to join all Democrats."
13842,"Survivor’s sit-out guideline has been simplified. Under the old rule, a player only had to avoid sitting out “consecutive challenges within one cycle,” so the same person could still skip successive Immunity Challenges if no Reward Challenge intervened—something fans found confusing, especially after seasons were shortened from 39 to 26 days. Triggered by Claire Rafson sitting out three straight Immunity Challenges in Survivor 44, producers revised the policy. Jeff Probst told the Survivor 45 cast: “You cannot sit out of back-to-back challenges, period; whoever sits out this challenge must compete in the next.” The change should prevent further ambiguity. Current 90-minute episodes (a schedule adjustment linked to Hollywood strikes) feature more footage, and recent Survivor 45 storylines include Hannah Rose explaining why she asked to be voted out and Brandon Donlon discussing his panic attack and blackout. Episodes stream on Paramount+, and the show airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on CBS."

She ends up sleeping with Adam, deepening that bond without lessening her feelings for Nick. A physical fight erupts between the brothers; Sally stops it, but Nick insists she decide. The show teases that Sally’s eventual choice will surprise viewers."

• Young’s arrival would join him with Wilkins, Sieler, Phillips and Chubb, potentially fixing the team’s low sack totals before a playoff run.  
• A trade would require a long-term extension, but the Dolphins have shown a willingness to pay for top talent and could manage the cap.

• USCIS Director Jaddou visited NYC reception sites where federal staff give migrants information, run a work-authorization support center, and offer services with partners such as the American Red Cross.  
• USCIS is accelerating work-permit processing, holding information sessions in libraries, sending email/SMS eligibility alerts, and using mobile biometric services; it aims to average a 30-day turnaround for work-permit approvals.

• On October 30, District Judge Alia Moses, a George W. Bush appointee, issued a temporary restraining order stopping CBP from removing or damaging the wire, except in medical emergencies where no other life-saving options exist.  
• The restraining order lasts until November 13. Both sides will present further arguments on November 7.  
• Texas argues the wire is essential to “securing the border and stemming the flow of illegal migration,” while the federal government says agents cut it to give medical aid and meet their legal duty to process unauthorized entrants.

13971,"Melissa Claire Egan, who has been off The Young and the Restless since giving birth to her second son in July, has finished maternity leave and is already taping new episodes. She confirmed via Twitter that she has shot her first scenes back as Chelsea, so the character should reappear on-screen in roughly six to eight weeks—likely mid-to-late November—given the show’s production schedule."
13972,"Eric Forrester plans a “final-hurrah” couture showdown against his son Ridge during the week of Oct. 23 on The Bold and the Beautiful. Although he is secretly coughing up blood, his doctor, Dr. Colin Colby, warns he is dying and must stop working. Eric ignores the advice, determined to stage the show, while wife Donna keeps his condition quiet. Spoilers suggest his refusal to rest may lead to a serious medical crisis at the event, leaving viewers to wonder if his ego—and the fashion battle—will cost him his life."
13979,"The Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix returns the series to Las Vegas after a 40-year absence and will be the 1,100th World Championship round. Run at night on 18 November 2023, it is part of a record 23-race 2023 season. The temporary street circuit measures 3.8 miles, includes a two-kilometer stretch down the Strip, and—after more than 30 proposed layouts—has an approved high-speed design described as 17 corners, 3 straights and 3 DRS zones (ultimately finalized as 14 turns). Teams will employ low-downforce Monza-Spa aerodynamics, with the night setting both reducing heat and showcasing the city’s lights."
13495,"Luis Alfredo Jacobo, a Bakersfield, California drug kingpin, was sentenced to four concurrent life terms (one for running a continuing criminal enterprise and three for drug conspiracies) plus four years for 21 counts of unlawful use of communication devices. From 2016-2021 he directed three methamphetamine conspiracies in Oklahoma and Missouri, arranging Mexican supply, shipments as large as 200 lbs, and cash returns up to $100,000. Evidence included messages, money exchanges, 231 lbs of meth and $465,000 seized from an Oklahoma storage unit, and the arrest of codefendant Tony Garcia with 30 lbs of meth and a handgun. The case stemmed from OCDETF Operation “Pullin Chains” led by the DEA and the U.S. Attorney’s Office."
13499,"On 1 Oct 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom named EMILY’s List president Laphonza Butler to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Senator Dianne Feinstein, who died on 29 Sep 2023 after serving from 1992 to 2023 as the chamber’s oldest and longest-tenured woman member. Butler—an influential Democratic strategist, former SEIU California executive director, Kamala Harris advisor, Airbnb public-policy director, and SCRB Strategies partner—becomes the first openly Black lesbian senator. Her appointment is effective immediately and lasts until the November 2024 election. Although she currently resides in Maryland, Butler owns a California home and will change her voter registration to the state."
13503,"A weak coronal mass ejection reached Earth late Friday night into early Saturday, 20–21 Oct 2023, unexpectedly producing vivid Northern Lights over parts of the Midwest and Northern Plains. Displays were reported in Minnesota, Michigan, southern Wisconsin, North Dakota, and as far south as Omaha, Nebraska. Because the CME had slow solar-wind speeds and lacked the usual sharp data spike, many aurora watchers overlooked it; only a brief satellite data gap, a slight wind uptick, and a gradual negative Bz shift signaled its arrival—clues noted in advance by Charlie Bourdo. Bourdo has since shared a video tutorial on forecasting auroras, and Limitless Media encourages following their platforms for further updates."
13522,"Savannah Chrisley has entered a new relationship with former Auburn football player Robert Shiver. Last weekend the couple attended a Zach Bryan concert with Savannah’s brother, Grayson Chrisley, and Grayson’s girlfriend, all wearing matching shirts. This marks Savannah’s first serious dating situation since her on-and-off engagement to Nic Kerdiles and comes while she is legal guardian to Grayson and their niece/sister Chloe following parents Todd and Julie Chrisley’s imprisonment. Speaking in recent interviews, Savannah gushed about Shiver, saying she wants to “protect and love” the relationship, appreciates that he understands her family responsibilities because he has children himself, and noted he must finalize his divorce before they consider anything more serious."
13535,"Luna, an intern and Li Flannigan’s niece, learns that Eric Forrester is seriously ill. Worried that RJ Forrester is struggling to keep this secret, she decides to tell Ridge Forrester herself. Ridge becomes furious that RJ hid Eric’s diagnosis, while RJ feels betrayed by Luna. The storyline now hinges on whether RJ will forgive Luna for exposing the truth."
13554,"Cristina Michelle Husbands, 48, of Dallas, was sentenced to 64 months in federal prison for a multi-state bank-fraud conspiracy that stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, including $108,000 from Regions Bank accounts in Mississippi. Operating between November 2021 and April 2022, she used false IDs to withdraw funds in Mississippi, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas. Husbands, who said she was coerced while homeless and addicted to drugs, was recruited at shelters and addiction clinics. Already jailed in Texas for similar offenses, she received five years of supervised release and must pay $481,140 in restitution. U.S. District Judge Sul Ozerden imposed the sentence; Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie prosecuted the case. Husbands apologized and still faces additional charges in other states."
13558,"Texas Democratic Representative Eddie Morales, whose district includes parts of El Paso, Del Rio, and Eagle Pass, told Fox 4 that the Biden administration is not adequately aiding border states amid continued high migrant crossings (roughly 100 000 shy of last year’s record 2.38 million encounters). Morales proposed that each migrant pay a $2 000 processing fee on entry, receive a non-voting RFID ID/credit card, and join temporary workforce agreements arranged between Mexican and Texas officials. He estimates that, with about 1 600 daily crossings in the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector, the fee could raise roughly $3.2 million per day—or $1.2 billion annually—in that area alone."
13569,"Jag Bains won the Week 12 Power of Veto—his fifth consecutive competition victory—after already securing Head of Household. He has Blue Kim and America Lopez on the block and plans to leave nominations the same to ensure Blue’s eviction. With only four votes this week, Bowie Jane and Matt Klotz want Blue out; Cirie Fields probably won’t, while Felicia Cannon likely will, leaving Jag one vote short of certainty for now. A forthcoming double eviction means Jag, ineligible for the next HOH, will rely on Matt to win that competition to protect him. Current spoilers point to Blue’s eviction and Jag’s potential vulnerability in the double eviction."
13577,"Hope tells Brooke that Deacon is romantically involved with Sheila, news confirmed by Finn. Shocked, Brooke confronts Deacon; he acknowledges the relationship and insists Sheila has changed, but Brooke warns he risks losing everyone. Brooke later informs Ridge, who confesses he has known about Deacon and Sheila for some time but kept it from her."
13583,"Kelly Clarkson and Lionel Richie are resuming Las Vegas residencies.  

• Kelly Clarkson has added new shows at the Bakkt Theater, Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino; the dates include special performances on New Year’s Eve and Super Bowl weekend.  
• Lionel Richie will extend his “King of Hearts” residency at the Encore Theater, Wynn Las Vegas, running from June 26 to November 16, 2024.  

Both artists’ previous Vegas runs were highly praised, and their 2024 appearances are expected to be major draws on the Strip."
15619,"Two connected shootings occurred Thursday night in the Washington area. They began as a suspected domestic kidnapping: police spotted the suspect’s vehicle outside the U.S. Census Bureau in Suitland, Maryland. When a guard approached the vehicle and saw an argument inside, the guard was shot and left in extremely critical condition. The suspect fled, firing at several locations as police pursued. The chase ended with a crash and shootout on Washington’s H Street, wounding both an officer and the suspect; both were conscious and talking afterward. The kidnapping victim was found unharmed. Authorities have not released the names of the guard, officer, or suspect."
15647,"California’s health department has declared the state’s measles outbreak over, noting that 42 days have passed since the last B3-strain case—double the virus’s incubation period. The outbreak, which began with visitors to two Disney theme parks, ultimately involved 131 B3 cases (plus five of a different genotype); of the 81 patients with known vaccination status, 70% were unvaccinated. Forty-two of the cases occurred between December 17-20. Officials credited rapid case investigations, extensive contact tracing, targeted vaccinations, and heightened provider awareness for containing the spread."
15748,"Jill (Duggar) Dillard—the first married daughter from TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting”—gave birth Monday to a 9-pound, 10-ounce son named Israel David. The student midwife and her husband, Derick, welcomed the baby more than a week past his due date, and Jill’s parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, shared a video of the family on Facebook. While Jill becomes the first Duggar daughter to have a child, eldest son Josh already has three children and a fourth expected in July."
15777,"Airline pilots usually separate personal problems from work, and even clinical depression is now manageable in aviation because the FAA permits certain medications. Andreas Lubitz, the Germanwings Flight 9525 co-pilot, suffered from much more serious psychiatric troubles—serious enough to require injections—and people close to him had noticed warning signs.  

Despite multiple “hoops” that should have exposed such issues, no one intervened:  
• Glider flying, which reveals participants’ personalities, showed no recorded concerns.  
• Lubitz passed Lufthansa’s highly competitive screening and entered its ab initio MPL program in Arizona—a costly, intensely supervised course that gives trainees only about 250 hours of training; Lubitz even took an unusual leave during it.  
• He disclosed prior depression to Lufthansa yet was still cleared to fly, accumulating just over 600 total flight hours.  
• Fellow pilots, who normally detect odd behavior in the cockpit, apparently raised no alarms.  

Germanwings, Lufthansa’s lower-pay subsidiary, imposed lower salaries and heavier schedules, adding further stress. With all these unchecked factors converging, the author argues the catastrophe was “an accident waiting to happen” and underscores the investigation’s goal: ensure it never recurs."
15782,"Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a 23-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Columbus, Ohio, pleaded not guilty to federal counts of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI. Prosecutors allege he became a citizen in February 2014, quickly obtained a passport, and in April 2014 traveled to Syria—using a ticket to Greece with a layover in Istanbul—to receive weapons, explosives, and combat training. According to the indictment, a cleric then instructed him to return to the United States and carry out attacks, with plans focusing on executing U.S. soldiers or striking a military base or prison. Mohamud, who reportedly praised the death of his brother fighting for al-Nusra Front, was remanded into custody; his attorney Sam Shamansky said he expects a vigorous defense."
15784,"Sheriff Stanley Glanz said two Tulsa deputies seen restraining Eric Harris during the April 2 arrest in which reserve deputy Robert Bates fatally shot Harris have been reassigned after receiving threats. The pair, criticized for pinning Harris as he gasped “I’m losing my breath” and an officer replied “F*ck your breath,” face no charges, while Bates, 73, is charged with second-degree manslaughter for firing his handgun after yelling “Taser, Taser.” Glanz has suspended the sheriff’s drug unit and may delay internal reviews of the deputies until Bates’ case concludes; Bates is free on $25,000 bond and claims the shooting was accidental. Amid allegations his training records were forged, Glanz insisted Bates was properly qualified and said the FBI found no civil-rights violations. The sheriff apologized to Harris’ family, announced a new outside policy review, and the family continues to demand justice and departmental reforms."
11350,"Carlos Colina, 32, has been charged with murder after human remains were found in a duffel bag in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on Saturday. Surveillance footage linked him to an apartment building where additional body parts were located. The victim was identified as Jonathan Camilien, 26, who knew Colina. Colina will be arraigned on April 14 and had already been arraigned for assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body; his bail in a separate assault case was revoked."
11354,"On a rainy Tuesday in Washington, CNN’s Brian Todd and Khalil Abdallah encountered a mother duck and her ducklings crossing busy L Street NW. Restaurant patrons and other pedestrians intervened: one man lent his umbrella, others blocked traffic, and a stray duckling was retrieved. The group escorted the birds to a safer grassy spot at 16th and L Streets NW. Todd called the downtown wildlife sighting “extraordinary,” and the incident drew coverage from both CNN and The Washington Post."
11365,"• Since Saudi-led air operations began on March 26, more than 500 Houthi rebels have been killed, according to Saudi officials.  
• The nine-nation coalition has carried out about 1,200 airstrikes aimed at preventing Houthi advances toward southern Yemen.  
• Border clashes in Najran on Friday left three Saudi officers dead and two wounded after Houthi mortar fire.  
• Civilian tolls vary: Yemen’s Health Ministry cites 385 dead and 342 wounded, while the WHO counts 648 dead and 2,191 wounded, including combatants.  
• Yemen has been in turmoil since Houthis ousted President Hadi in January, and even before the latest fighting most of the country’s 25 million people needed humanitarian aid, the UN says."
11396,"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, head of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, and the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic leader ever convicted in the church’s sex-abuse scandal. Finn was found guilty in 2012 of one misdemeanor count of failing to report suspected child abuse after officials delayed nearly five months before alerting police to disturbing images discovered on Father Shawn Ratigan’s computer; Ratigan later pleaded guilty to child-pornography charges. Finn received two years’ probation, was ordered to establish a $10,000 counseling fund, and mandated abuse-reporting training for church officials, but kept his post until now. Critics, including Cardinal Sean O’Malley and Notre Dame professor Candida Moss, faulted the years-long delay in removing him and urged clearer Vatican accountability. Following Finn’s departure, Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann has been named apostolic administrator of the Kansas City diocese until a permanent bishop is appointed. Watchdog group BishopAccountability.org called the move only an initial step toward true bishop accountability."
11416,"Tristan da Cunha, a South-Atlantic UK overseas territory with roughly 270 residents and only seven family names, is launching an international architecture and design competition with RIBA.  Aimed at the settlement’s 200th anniversary in 2016, the contest seeks practical, cost-effective ideas to:

• modernize 40-year-old housing and public buildings,  
• boost energy efficiency and renewable-power use,  
• strengthen limited transport, communications and agrarian systems, and  
• reduce dependence on costly imports and fossil fuels.

Key constraints include shipment of materials through a small port accessible just 60 days a year, a seven-day, 1,750-mile sea journey from Cape Town, and tight cargo capacities.  

The archipelago has four islands (only Tristan is inhabited; Gough and Inaccessible are UNESCO sites) and already runs on lobster fishing, stamp/coin sales, handicrafts and modest tourism. Recent upgrades covered water, electricity and wastewater systems.  

Designers must submit initial proposals by mid-June 2015; a 20-strong long-list will be cut to five finalists, and a winner—funded via UK/EU grants—is due to be named in June 2016."
11428,"“Inside Politics” highlighted five developing stories:

• President Obama heads to a Panama summit where a possible first-in-decades meeting with Cuba’s Raúl Castro is under debate; the White House must weigh whether such a sit-down advances policy or prematurely rewards Havana.  
• Hillary Clinton will soon announce her 2016 bid from new Brooklyn headquarters. Her rollout will “re-introduce” her through biographical themes (childhood, early children’s-advocacy work, Arkansas years), showcase an unexpectedly large, experienced staff, and favor small, personal events.  
• Sen. Robert Menendez’s corruption indictment includes an alleged staff request for super-PAC money, a charge campaign-finance watchdogs say could trigger wider probes of other lawmakers.  
• The GOP field formalizes next week: Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio will be declared candidates. Growing pressure forces party operatives to pick teams; examples include strategist Matt Maroney joining Chris Christie and pollster Tony Fabrizio siding with Rand Paul after approaches from other camps."
11430,"CNN has promoted Jake Tapper to anchor its Sunday morning political show “State of the Union,” starting in June. Tapper will keep his roles as the network’s chief Washington correspondent and weekday host of “The Lead.” He replaces Candy Crowley, whose December departure led to a series of fill-in hosts. Announcing the move, CNN Worldwide CEO Jeff Zucker praised Tapper’s reporting and interviewing skills, while Tapper expressed excitement about guiding the program during the election season. Tapper joined CNN from ABC in 2013 and previously earned praise as interim host of ABC’s “This Week.” His dual weekday-and-Sunday duties mirror arrangements at ABC (George Stephanopoulos) and recall CNN’s earlier model with Wolf Blitzer. The shift comes amid broader Sunday-show changes, including CBS’s transition from Bob Schieffer to John Dickerson and NBC’s earlier switch from David Gregory to Chuck Todd."
11773,"Oscar-winning rapper-actor Common has signed on for Warner Bros.’ “Suicide Squad,” directed by David Ayer and now filming in Toronto. The super-villain ensemble already includes Jared Leto (Joker), Will Smith (Deadshot), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), Joel Kinnaman, Cara Delevingne, Viola Davis, Adam Beach, Ike Barinholtz, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Scott Eastwood, with rumored cameos by Jesse Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor and Ben Affleck’s Batman. The film—described as a “Dirty Dozen” with DC villains—follows imprisoned criminals forced into covert government missions. Common’s role remains undisclosed. He is currently appearing in “Run All Night,” recently won an Oscar for the song “Glory” from “Selma,” and is set to shoot “Hunter Killer” with Gerard Butler in July."
11800,"• American aid worker Warren Weinstein, 73, abducted from his Lahore, Pakistan, home in 2011 by gunmen linked to al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a January U.S. drone strike on an al Qaeda compound; the strike also killed Italian hostage Giovanni Lo Porto.  
• U.S. officials say they did not know hostages were present; President Obama announced the death and ordered an independent investigation, praising Weinstein’s lifelong public-service work, including years as a USAID contractor in Pakistan.  
• Weinstein’s family had campaigned for his release, citing his worsening health and criticizing both U.S. and Pakistani authorities for inconsistent efforts, though they emphasized al Qaeda’s ultimate responsibility for his fate.  
• Elaine Weinstein expressed heartbreak and called for a coordinated U.S. approach to future hostage situations, while noting her husband’s dedication to helping the Pakistani people and his respect for their culture."
11803,"South Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo, implicated in a widening corruption scandal, has offered to resign but will serve until President Park Geun-hye decides. His Cabinet-chairing duties have been handed to the deputy prime minister. The scandal erupted after businessman Sung Woan-jong, found dead in an apparent April 9 suicide, left a note naming Lee and seven other figures tied to Park as recipients of illicit cash. A special prosecutor is investigating. Lee denies wrongdoing, pledging full cooperation. Park, calling the situation “regrettable,” has vowed zero tolerance for corruption while traveling in Latin America and is due back April 27."
11871,"Corinthian Colleges Inc. will close its last 28 campuses, capping years of scrutiny of for-profit “predator colleges.” Once enrolling 70,000 students, Corinthian lost access to federal aid last summer and could not sell its remaining schools. The shutdown highlights systemic problems among for-profit career colleges—largely online institutions that:

• Enroll 13 % of U.S. college students yet generate nearly half of all student-loan defaults, despite receiving about 86 % of their revenue from federal loans.  
• Charge roughly 60 % more than comparable public colleges while graduates earn less, on average, than high-school dropouts.  
• Use aggressive recruitment—e.g., 100 calls a day to low-income prospects—to secure federal loan dollars, leaving many students with heavy debt and poor job prospects.

Industry misconduct is well documented: a 2011 GAO probe found widespread rule-breaking; 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profits in 2014; Career Education Corp. paid $10 million for phony placement claims. Facing mounting evidence, hundreds of Corinthian alumni launched a “debt strike,” prompting Education Secretary Arne Duncan to consider loan forgiveness.

The article urges closing remaining for-profit colleges and canceling debts for students not employed or transferred within three years, arguing that continuing federal support for such schools is financially untenable and socially damaging."
11884,"Kabul has rapidly expanded but feels diminished as NATO’s presence winds down.  
• English-speaking Afghans who once worked for NATO have been fired, black-listed, and now sleep in market stalls, fearing reprisals and unable to visit their families.  
• Foreign contractors and NGO workers are gone; former expatriate neighborhoods, restaurants, and the famed Chicken Street are deserted.  
• Idle heavy machinery and thousands of unsellable supply trucks line the roads, symbolizing abandoned U.S. wartime projects and leaving Afghan drivers in debt while their former bosses live abroad.  
• Despite the gloom, brightly lit wedding halls still thrive, yet many wonder how long Kabul’s lights—kept on by costly, seldom-used diesel plants—will last once the final American troops withdraw to the U.S. Embassy next year."
11885,"Consumer Reports analyzed 70 million domestic trips to see how often the five largest U.S. airlines let customers redeem frequent-flier miles.

• Award-seat availability  
  – Southwest: best, 11.9 million award seats (11.5 % of 103.1 million total). Policies include “every seat an award seat,” no blackout dates, no fees for close-in booking or cancellations, points never expire.  
  – Delta: 5.6 million award seats (2nd).  
  – United: 5 million (3rd).  
  – American: 3.5 million (4th).  
  – JetBlue: worst, 892 000 award seats, 4.5 % of 19.7 million seats; limited network and infrequent flyers hinder mile accrual.

• Overall, almost 10 % of passengers on the five carriers flew on award tickets.

• Value of miles varies: using 12 500–30 000 miles for cheap routes like Los Angeles–San Francisco (~$100 cash fare) is poor value; longer, costlier routes (e.g., New York–San Francisco on American, Chicago–Los Angeles on Delta) yield better returns.

• Customer satisfaction scores: Southwest 86, JetBlue 85, Delta 70, American 66, United 63.

• Fees matter: Southwest charges none; other airlines impose fees for checked bags, phone bookings, itinerary changes, etc.

Key takeaway: Southwest leads in both award availability and customer satisfaction, while JetBlue offers the fewest award seats; travelers should redeem miles on higher-priced routes and watch for extra fees."
11890,"In July 2012, James Holmes opened fire during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 people and wounding 70. Dressed in body armor, a gas mask and dyed-orange hair resembling the Joker, he used multiple firearms and booby-trapped his apartment with explosives. 

Holmes, now 27, admits the shootings but pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, saying he suffered a severe psychotic episode; prosecutors seek the death penalty. Opening statements begin Monday, with a trial expected to last four-to-five months. From a pool of 9,000, a panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates (19 women, 5 men) will decide 165 charges, including murder and attempted murder.

A gifted student, Holmes grew up in coastal and San Diego, California, excelled academically, earned a neuroscience degree with highest honors at UC Riverside (2010), and entered a neuroscience Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado Anschutz in 2011 on an NIH grant. His mental health declined: he voiced homicidal thoughts to a classmate, threatened a professor, and concerned campus psychiatrist Lynne Fenton, who warned he might be dangerous. Weeks before the attack he legally bought four guns and over 6,000 rounds of ammunition.

Victims’ families urge media to curb the use of mass killers’ names and images. Holmes’ parents ask that his life be spared and, if ruled insane, that he be confined to a mental institution. The jury will decide his fate."
11891,"Pastor Creflo Dollar, known for preaching the prosperity gospel, posted a new five-minute YouTube clip to defend his effort to buy a $65 million Gulfstream G650 jet. Speaking at World Changers Church International, he said “the devil” is trying to discredit him and insisted he never asked his congregation directly for money, though a March video had sought $300 donations from 200,000 global supporters to replace his aging 1984 Gulfstream G-1159A, which suffered two accidents. The original fundraiser page has been removed, yet gifts are still accepted through the church site, and Dollar claims more than three million worldwide supporters want him to travel to them. Critics question why a preacher needs such a plane; Dollar answers that outsiders don’t understand his ministry’s work."
