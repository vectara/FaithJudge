14-0,"Militants stormed Kabul’s 400-bed Sardar Daud military hospital at about 09:00 local time, detonating explosives at the front gate before shooting staff and patients. Four gunmen—one seen wearing a white doctor’s coat—fought security forces for more than six hours until commandos who landed on the roof killed them. The assault left more than 50 people wounded; images released by IS media showed additional fatalities. Islamic State claimed responsibility while the Taliban denied involvement. Officials, including President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, condemned the attack on a site traditionally regarded as off-limits. Analysts noted this was IS’s first direct clash with security forces in Kabul, signalling greater capability after earlier attacks on civilian targets, and warning of further high-profile assaults as IS seeks to expand beyond its eastern strongholds."
14-1,"2014 is the Man Booker Prize’s 46th year and the first in which any writer of English, no matter the nationality, can compete.  
• The six-book shortlist is:  
  – Neel Mukherjee, The Lives of Others (family and politics in 1960s Calcutta) – the 5/2 bookmakers’ favourite.  
  – Richard Flanagan, The Narrow Road to the Deep North (WWII love story set on the Thai-Burma railway) – next in the betting at 3/1.  
  – Howard Jacobson, J (futuristic love story in a society that suppresses its past).  
  – Ali Smith, How to Be Both (twin narratives: a 15th-century artist and a 1960s child).  
  – Joshua Ferris, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour (atheist New York dentist and online identity theft).  
  – Karen Joy Fowler, We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves (college student’s unusual family) – the list’s top seller with 55,000 copies; Ferris has sold just over 6,000, while Mukherjee’s weekly sales leapt from 97 to 507 after the shortlist was named.  

• Judges: chair A. C. Grayling with Sarah Churchwell, Jonathan Bate, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. Each shortlisted author already receives £2,500 and a specially bound copy of their book.  

• Winner will be revealed Tuesday night at London’s Guildhall, with coverage on the BBC News Channel (from 21:30 BST) and BBC Arts; the Duchess of Cornwall will present the prize.  

• Commentator David Brauner calls the list “weak,” saying Jacobson’s J is strongest but may suffer from reluctance to grant him a second Booker so soon after Hilary Mantel’s double win.  

• Last year’s prize went to New Zealander Eleanor Catton for The Luminaries."
14-2,"• Speculation over Mark Carney’s future centred on two choices: depart as first agreed in 2018 or stay the full eight-year term to 2021.  
• Instead, the Bank of England Governor chose a “third way”: extend by just one year and leave in 2019.  
• The main motive is personal—his family, particularly two daughters finishing A-levels and GCSEs in 2018, wish to return to Canada; Carney insists the decision is “entirely personal” and not about politics, forecasts or pressure.  
• Theresa May wanted him to stay longer but left the decision to him; those close to Carney deny any tension with government or sensitivity to critics.  
• Professionally he judged it hard to exit in mid-Brexit negotiations, so the one-year extension lets him help steer the economy until Article 50 talks should be finished, after which a new Governor will take over."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, celebrated yet often controversial Sunday Times columnist, has died shortly after revealing he had the “full English” of cancers and was receiving chemotherapy. Editor Martin Ivens called him “a giant among journalists” and said Gill’s final piece, reflecting on his diagnosis, runs in tomorrow’s paper. Colleagues and peers—Jay Rayner, Tim Shipman, Stig Abell, John Witherow, Andrew Neil, Piers Morgan and others—praised his dazzling, fearless prose, noting he usually dictated copy because of dyslexia.

Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill studied art before turning to writing in the 1980s, joining the Sunday Times in 1993. His sharp pen drew frequent controversy—among them shooting a baboon, derogatory remarks about the Welsh, Norfolk and the Isle of Man, a slur on Clare Balding, and an ejection from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.

Gill married author Cressida Connolly (1983) and later Amber Rudd (1991), with whom he had two children, Flora and Alistair. Illness spurred his engagement to long-time partner Nicola Formby, mother of his twins Edith and Isaac."
14-4,"The passage profiles three self-declared, non-state hacker groups active around the Ukraine conflict.

1. Ukrainian Cyber Troops – Pro-Ukrainian collective led by Kyiv programmer Yevhen Dokukin. 
   • Hacks Russian Interior Ministry servers and police email, passes 35 GB+ of data to volunteers who claim it shows wounded Russian soldiers evacuated from Ukraine.  
   • Uses DDoS attacks to disable separatist websites (“our artillery”), freezes rebels’ PayPal/WebMoney accounts, hijacks CCTV in rebel zones for troop-tracking, and commandeers network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages.  
   • Media speculate the army uses their intelligence, but Ukrainian officials deny relying on unverified hacker data.

2. Cyber Berkut – Pro-Russian, anti-Western group named after former Ukrainian riot police. 
   • Says its goal is to block Kyiv’s “genocide.”  
   • Defaced Ukrainian government sites during U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden’s November visit, calling him “the fascists’ master,” and claims it stole U.S. military-aid documents from a Biden team device.  
   • Hijacked Kyiv billboards with graphic anti-government videos; claims to have disrupted Ukraine’s election vote-counting, leaked defence data on losses/desertions, blocked President Poroshenko’s site, and posted an unverified chat alleging Ukraine downed MH17.

3. Anonymous International (Shaltay Boltay/Humpty Dumpty) – Russian leak group.
   • Publishes Kremlin documents; unclear whether through hacking or insider leaks.  
   • Released a Russian fighter’s letter saying locals don’t back separatists and emails linked to ex-FSB colonel Igor Girkin (Strelkov).  
   • Its website is now blocked in Russia.

All three act outside formal state structures but operate as “virtual warriors,” exposing documents, defacing sites and disrupting digital infrastructure amid the wider Ukraine-Russia confrontation."

The items—amassed through his lifelong interests in literature and military history—include early Victorian Gillows cabinets (est. up to £4,000), a hand-painted 3-D diorama of the 1415 Battle of Agincourt commissioned in the 1960s (est. £4,000–£6,000), a yew longbow with mother-of-pearl handle and a portrait of Hardy holding it (est. up to £2,000), plus other paintings, furniture, swords, flintlock rifles, silverware, crystal chandeliers, and books dating to the 17th century.

15-3,"A University of Washington/Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation study (American Journal of Public Health) analyzed 3.7 million adults and is the first to map U.S. drinking patterns by county.  

Key findings (2005-2012 unless noted):  
• Heavy drinking rose 17.2%, largely because women’s rates climbed sharply.  
• Binge-drinking growth among women was more than seven times that of men; in Santa Clara County, CA, women’s binge drinking jumped 36% vs. 23% for men.  
• 2012 prevalence: 8% of U.S. adults were heavy drinkers; 18% were binge drinkers, while overall alcohol use stayed steady.  
• County extremes (2012):  
  – Lowest binge drinking: Madison County, ID (6%); highest: Menominee, WI (36%).  
  – Fewest heavy drinkers: Hancock County, TN (2%); most: Esmeralda County, NV (22%).  

Definitions used: heavy drinking = >1 drink/day (women) or >2 (men); binge drinking = ≥4 drinks (women) or ≥5 (men) on one occasion in the past month.  

Consequences & context: about 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010 and >$220 billion/year in costs are tied to alcohol. Experts cite shifting social norms for women, youthful and affluent populations, cheaper real prices, increased advertising, and relaxed alcohol-control laws as drivers. Treatment providers report more clients yet believe many heavy drinkers still avoid care."

16-0,"The article frames Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao as likely to be boxing’s richest and most significant bout, noting that a fight’s true historical standing combines its action with wider political, social and cultural impact; where Mayweather-Pacquiao will rank depends on what happens fight night.

As part of a 12-fight historical series it revisits Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Durán:

• First meeting (Montreal, June 1980): Durán won a disputed unanimous decision, the scorecards so confused one judge’s totals had to be altered afterward.  
• Rematch (Louisiana Superdome, 25 Nov 1980): Leonard abandoned the first fight’s slugging tactic, used speed and movement to frustrate Durán, who suddenly turned away in round eight saying “no más.” The boxing world was shocked; Durán blamed stomach cramps but his manager called it embarrassment. Panama briefly shunned its national hero, pulling his TV ads.  
• Durán regained esteem by knocking out Davey Moore on 16 Jun 1983 to claim the light-middleweight title, and Leonard won their third encounter by wide decision in 1989. Leonard considered forcing Durán to quit his greatest satisfaction.

The race will be McCoy’s final Grade One ride; his full book for his last day in the saddle will be set on Friday. Other entrants include Mick Channon’s Somersby."
11-1,"At 75, Jack Nicklaus made his first Augusta National hole-in-one during the Masters par-3 contest, holing a 130-yard tee shot on the 4th while playing with Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw. The ace helped produce one of five on the day, tying the 2002 record. Camilo Villegas recorded two of those aces but lost the contest to Kevin Streelman in a play-off. Nicklaus, the 1963 and 1986 Masters champion and one of five career-grand-slam winners, celebrated the feat with the crowd, noting he had joked earlier about needing a par-3 win and a hole-in-one."
11-3,"A 5.68 m juvenile female Omura’s whale—once feared extinct—washed ashore on a remote Exmouth beach at Western Australia’s North West Cape after Cyclone Olwyn. This is the first recorded sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff confirmed the identification through DNA profiling, after initial uncertainty. Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the discovery “highly significant,” noting that Omura’s whales were only formally described in 2003 and are thought to inhabit tropical and subtropical waters, usually around Indonesia, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. The species is characterized by a sleek body and distinctive skeletal traits, including four digits on each pectoral fin and a high vertebrae count (reported in the passage as 53 and later 67). The carcass has been buried; its skeleton will be exhumed in a few years for further scientific study and possible museum display, aiding efforts to improve identification guides and understand the whale’s distribution."
11-4,"A 5.68 m juvenile female Omura’s whale, a species once feared extinct, washed ashore on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Cyclone Olwyn. This is the first WA and only the second Australian record of the species. Identification initially puzzled Parks and Wildlife staff but was confirmed via DNA profiling. Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the find highly significant, noting the whale was only first described in 2003 and is normally confined to tropical–subtropical waters around Indonesia, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. The carcass has been buried so the skeleton—distinguished by its sleek form and unusual vertebrae and pectoral-fin digits—can be retrieved later for research and possible museum display."

10-0,"Russia opened the recovered “black box” of the Su-24 bomber in Moscow, but investigators said key flight data are missing; a detailed analysis will be published next week. The information is sought to clarify whether the aircraft was in Turkish or Syrian airspace when Turkish F-16s shot it down on 24 November. The incident, in which the pilot and a rescue marine were killed, has severely strained Russia-Turkey relations: Moscow demands an apology, has imposed sanctions such as banning Russian package holidays to Turkey, and President Putin has sharply criticized the Turkish government."
10-2,"An oil-leak explosion Monday night at a paraxylene (PX) plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian, started a large fire that is now under control. Six people were hurt—five by flying glass—and no toxic spill has been reported. More than 600 firefighters responded, while nearby residents felt the blast and shared images online. The same plant, moved from Xiamen after 2007 protests, also suffered an explosion in 2013."
10-3,"• In autumn 2004 a 15-year-old girl was raped in a Portsmouth garage by David Ayrton.  
• Ayrton, now 34, has since changed name to Davina (2012), identifies as female, and denies the charge.  
• A Portsmouth Crown Court jury convicted Ayrton; sentencing is set for 4 March.  
• Judge Ian Pearson remanded Ayrton to custody, probably in a male prison in Winchester, citing risks of self-harm and non-attendance.  
• Ayrton has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer; special detention protocols will apply.  
• During the trial Ayrton said no physical or medical gender changes had been made.  
• The victim testified she resisted and remembered events clearly after minimal alcohol.  
• In 2014 Ayrton disclosed the assault to a care-home worker in Fordingbridge, Hampshire."
10-4,"Eugene, Oregon, USA has been chosen to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships.  
• The IAAF Council bypassed the normal bidding process, calling it a “unique strategic opportunity” to stage the event in the United States for the first time.  
• Eugene had unsuccessfully bid for the 2019 championships, which were awarded to Doha, Qatar.  
• IAAF President Lamine Diack said the decision reflects strong backing from public authorities, the private sector, the U.S. Olympic Committee, NBC, and an enthusiastic local public.  
• A similar direct-award occurred for the 2007 championships in Osaka, Japan."
13-0,"• Doncaster-based Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson, severely injured by a 2006 Afghanistan bomb blast, carried the Olympic torch for nearly 30 minutes on 26 June, supported by an aide and cheered by hundreds.

• His nomination notes the brain injury initially cost him speech but not his humour; he now speaks unaided, spends 12 hours daily on gym/rehab, walks with crutches, and raises funds for military charities as patron of Pilgrim Bandits.

• Torch-bearing has triggered an online outpouring: thousands of Facebook friend requests exceeded the 5,000-friend limit, his page update drew 19,000 hits, postal and email messages have soared, and he has had many invitations to appear with the torch.

• Mother Diane Parkinson says the public response has “been phenomenal” and has greatly lifted Ben’s spirits.

• Facebook suggests he create a public page or use “subscribe” to handle the demand.

• Parkinson is one of 8,000 torchbearers on the flame’s 8,000-mile, 70-day route to the London Olympic opening ceremony on 27 July."
13-1,"The new Poldark episode jumps abruptly from Demelza’s recent pregnancy announcement to her being eight months along and, minutes later, giving birth to Ross Poldark’s daughter. Viewers will quickly see Ross doting on the baby, affirming his deepening love for Demelza, whom he married despite initial doubts. Fans have noted the series’ compressed pregnancy timelines—this one echoes Elizabeth’s earlier off-screen full term—and have joked on Twitter that, in Poldark, pregnancies conclude “in the next 10 minutes.”"
13-2,"Official data show that 272 children in England were hospitalised last year with brain damage from foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Experts say the real toll is far higher: World Health Organisation research indicates at least 1 % of UK births—about 7,500 babies annually—may suffer learning, behavioural, physical or organ problems from alcohol exposure in the womb. FAS is permanent and often under-diagnosed; a case example is 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who needs daily support and inspired her adoptive parents to create the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust in 2007. Related medical issues include liver, kidney, heart defects, cerebral palsy, sight loss and epilepsy. Government advice is for pregnant women to avoid alcohol, or if they do drink, limit it to a maximum of two units twice a week, though campaigners argue the guidance should be zero alcohol."
13-3,"Scotland’s women have won all five Euro 2017 qualifying games and will virtually clinch a finals place if they beat fellow-unbeaten Iceland at Falkirk on Friday, with a return match set for 20 September. Striker Lisa Evans, twice denied by play-off defeats (Euro 2013, 2015 World Cup), says another failure would be “devastating” but stresses the squad are taking the campaign “step by step.” Because six of the eight best runners-up also qualify automatically, Scotland already sit in a strong position. 

Iceland, world-ranked 20th and top seeds, are expected to provide the toughest test, yet Evans believes home support could be decisive. Twelve of Scotland’s 20-player squad now play abroad—five in England, four in Sweden and two in the USA—with Evans herself fresh from winning the German Bundesliga with Bayern Munich. She feels exposure to stronger leagues is accelerating Scotland’s progress, adding that training daily alongside elite players overseas raises national-team standards."
13-4,"In Fort Pierce, Florida, a light Aerostar aircraft was filmed approaching Aero Acres Residential Airpark with its landing gear retracted. It touched down on its belly, scraping along the runway as its propellers struck the tarmac. Realizing the error, the pilot applied full throttle, lifted off again despite damaged propellers, and flew about 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale, where he landed safely. The pilot, 85-year-old Chris Georgaklis, who has nearly 50 years of flying experience and was traveling with his dog Buddy, was uninjured. The incident, likely a gear-up (belly) landing caused by either pilot oversight or mechanical failure, is under FAA investigation."

12-1,"Irish fighter Conor McGregor, 26, is preparing to challenge José Aldo for the featherweight title in Las Vegas on July 11. Ahead of the bout he revealed a new tiger-face tattoo on his stomach (adding to the gorilla-eating-a-heart ink on his chest), posting it on Instagram with the caption, “If you see the tiger, it’s too late. You’re food.” McGregor says he is more motivated than Aldo, who will be making his eighth title defense. Their rivalry intensified on a recent promotional tour in Dublin, where McGregor snatched Aldo’s belt before 5,000 fans, highlighting their fractious relationship three months out from the fight."
12-3,"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck at 15:48 local time (14:48 GMT) at a depth of 15.5 km, with its epicentre in Garfagnana, about 35 km north of Lucca. The tremor, described by INGV’s Alessandro Amato as a “medium-strong” and “fairly shallow” quake that “came out of nowhere,” was felt in Lucca, Milan, Florence, Bologna and Modena. Several lower-magnitude aftershocks followed. No injuries or damage were immediately reported, though phone lines and power were cut in Garfagnana, and local schools were evacuated for safety checks. Italy, prone to quakes, recently suffered fatal events: two quakes in the same region last May killed more than 20, and the 2009 L’Aquila quake claimed nearly 300 lives—a disaster after which six scientists and an official were later convicted for providing reassuring but misleading risk assessments."
