15599,"Blue Bell Creameries has closed its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, plant after listeria was found in a 3-ounce ice-cream cup made there. The CDC urges consumers to discard any Blue Bell products from this facility, especially 3-ounce cups marked with the letters O–T after the date code; other Blue Bell items are not included. The shutdown—Blue Bell’s third action tied to listeria issues—aims to locate the contamination source. Listeria in the affected cup matched bacteria found in additional factory samples and resembled strains from illnesses linked to Blue Bell in Texas, but it differs from samples taken from Kansas patients; investigations continue to determine any direct link. Earlier, Blue Bell recalled items from a Texas plant after five Kansas hospital patients (three fatalities) became ill, four of whom had consumed the ice cream. This is the first recall in the company’s 108-year history. The CDC reminds institutions and consumers to discard recalled products, noting that listeriosis is a serious infection primarily threatening the elderly, pregnant women, newborns, and the immunocompromised."
15601,"A Columbia Journalism School review found that systemic failures in Rolling Stone’s reporting, editing, oversight and fact-checking produced a flawed story about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia. Rolling Stone’s managing editor issued a public apology to readers, UVA administrators, students and the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.  

Legal analysis of potential defamation claims notes:  
• Defamation requires publication of a false, harmful statement made with at least negligent intent.  
• Government bodies like UVA cannot sue for libel.  
• Group defamation is generally not actionable; individual members can sue only if the group is “comparatively small” and the statement is clearly imputed to each member.  
• Phi Kappa Psi may argue it fits this small-group exception, while Rolling Stone would contend the fraternity’s size and changing membership defeat that claim.  
• Other fraternities are even less likely to have standing.  
• Any plaintiff must also prove concrete reputational or financial harm.  

Thus, UVA has no claim, but Phi Kappa Psi or its individual members might prevail if they clear these procedural hurdles and demonstrate actual damages."
15604,"The writer, who in 1967 became the first woman and first person of color in the Kentucky State Senate, criticizes Senator Rand Paul’s newly announced presidential bid. While Paul presents his run as an effort to “expand” and include minorities in the Republican Party, the author cites his record as evidence to the contrary: questioning the Civil Rights Act, suggesting private businesses may discriminate, down-playing the need for a strengthened Voting Rights Act, calling for elimination of the Education Department, seeking to restrict women’s reproductive choices, and opposing protections for DREAMers. The author describes Paul’s minority-outreach efforts as condescending and argues that his views would take the nation backward, making him unfit for the presidency."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau, now 53, and her husband Vili Fualaau, 31, remain together nearly two decades after their illicit relationship began in 1996, when she was a 34-year-old married teacher and he was her 13-year-old student. Letourneau served more than seven years in prison and the couple wed shortly after her 2005 release; they have two teenage daughters and will mark their 10th wedding anniversary on May 20. In an upcoming ABC “20/20” interview with Barbara Walters, Letourneau discusses how their marriage endures despite the age gap, her wish to teach again, and efforts to remove her registered–sex-offender status, while Fualaau addresses his struggles with alcoholism, depression, and feeling the system failed him as a minor."
15616,"In July 2013 at LAX, Kanye West rushed paparazzo Daniel Ramos, trying to seize his camera; West later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery and received two years’ probation, anger-management classes, and community service. Ramos, represented by Gloria Allred, then filed a civil suit seeking general and punitive damages. The trial set for the following week was canceled after both parties reached a settlement that satisfied them; terms were undisclosed, but West formally apologized and the two shook hands, as shown in a released photo. Allred said the case underscored that celebrities “are not above the law.” (West had separately settled another alleged assault from January 2014 in Beverly Hills.)"
15617,"B.B. King, 89, was briefly hospitalized for dehydration related to his Type II diabetes but is “much better,” left the hospital the same day, and is now resting at home with his grandchildren. He thanked fans for their concern. Specific hospital details were not released. King—inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, holder of 30 Grammy nominations, known for his Gibson “Lucille” guitars, and hits such as “The Thrill Is Gone,” “There Must Be a Better World Somewhere,” and “When Love Comes to Town”—had previously canceled shows last year due to dehydration and exhaustion."
15623,"Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland, 31, was stabbed in the abdomen and left elbow around 4 a.m. Wednesday after leaving the 1OAK nightclub area in Chelsea, New York. The attack occurred down the street near the Fulton Houses as Copeland and his companion, Katrine Saltara, walked to their car; Saltara and a second woman were also slashed. Copeland’s driver subdued the 22-year-old male suspect, who never entered the club and is now in police custody; charges are pending and a knife was recovered. Copeland is in stable condition at a New York hospital.

Atlanta Hawks players Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30—who had played in Atlanta hours earlier—were arrested at the scene on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct (Sefolosha also for resisting arrest) after pushing through the crowd outside; police say they were not involved in the stabbing. Both players will miss the Hawks’ game against the Nets; the team and NBA are reviewing the matter.

1OAK states the incident began off-premises, that security aided Copeland upon his return toward the club, and that surveillance video does not capture the stabbing itself. The club shut down immediately afterward. Statements acknowledging and monitoring the situation were issued by Pacers president Larry Bird, Copeland’s agent, and Hawks officials."
15627,"Selena’s family is partnering with Nevada tech firm Acrovirt to create “Selena the One,” a hologram-like, fully animated version of the late Tejano star that will walk, talk, sing and dance. The digital figure—billed as the first to use Acrovirt’s “Digitized Human Essence” technology—will release new music, appear in videos, collaborate with current artists and mount a tour targeted for 2018. An Indiegogo campaign launching April 16 seeks $500,000 to fund the project, while the annual Fiesta de la Flor tribute in Corpus Christi follows on April 17–18. Family spokesperson Suzette Quintanilla emphasizes that the goal is to extend Selena’s legacy, which remains strong 20 years after her death."
15628,"Alaska Airlines Flight 448 left Seattle for Los Angeles on Monday but returned after 14 minutes when the pilot heard banging from the cargo hold. The noise came from a Menzies Aviation ramp agent who had accidentally fallen asleep inside while loading luggage. Passengers also heard pounding and faint cries; an onboard federal air marshal responded until landing. The pressurized, temperature-controlled hold kept the worker safe; he was taken to a hospital, passed a drug test, and released. His shift (5 a.m.–2:30 p.m.) had just ended, and coworkers thought he’d gone home when he couldn’t be reached. The flight, carrying 170 passengers and six crew, later continued to Los Angeles. Alaska Airlines is investigating."
15634,"Emy Afalava, a decorated veteran born in American Samoa (a U.S. territory since 1900), is barred from voting because the federal government denies him U.S. citizenship, despite the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee that anyone born “in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” is a citizen. He and other American Samoans are challenging this exclusion in a lawsuit now before the D.C. Circuit. The passage traces how racial prejudice has repeatedly shaped territorial citizenship: first in the Supreme Court’s Dred Scott decision against free African-Americans, later in early-1900s rulings that treated Puerto Ricans and other island residents as constitutionally inferior, exemplified by Isabel Gonzalez’s case. While all other U.S. territorial peoples have since received citizenship, American Samoans remain the lone exception. The author argues that continuing to withhold their citizenship perpetuates a discredited, racially driven legacy and urges the courts to correct it."
15638,"Iman (25) and Siham Hashi (27), Somali-born sisters who fled to Canada in 1991, perform together as Faarrow. Now based in Los Angeles, they are finishing their Warner Bros. debut album—co-written and produced with actor-musician Elijah Kelley—featuring a pop sound infused with hip-hop and African rhythms. Musical influences include Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, and the Spice Girls; current favorites range from Sia’s “Chandelier” to LunchMoney Lewis’s “Bills.”  

Beyond music, the pair serve as UNHCR spokespeople, have headlined World Refugee Day and the Nansen Awards, and run the nonprofit “Wish Creatively” (Women Internationally Selling Hope), which sells jewelry to fund projects for Somali and Kenyan women refugees. They see their growing musical platform as a means to support Somalia and inspire others while pursuing creative careers."
15651,"Pope Francis, presiding at a special Mass in Rome marking the centenary of the 1915–16 Armenian deaths, decided to call the killings “the first genocide of the 20th century.” He did so indirectly, quoting a 2001 document signed by St. John Paul II, underscoring the Vatican’s priority on continuity. Previous popes had avoided or muted the word, but Francis judged that omitting it at this high-profile event—attended by Armenia’s president—would imply a policy change. Turkey reacted sharply, recalling its Vatican ambassador, summoning the Holy See’s envoy and calling the remark “unacceptable.” The episode highlights the Pope’s recurring tension between prophetic candor and diplomatic caution; while maintaining traditional Vatican positions, Francis often engages forthrightly in global politics."
15652,"During National Park Week (April 18–26), all 128 U.S. national parks that normally charge entry fees, including Yellowstone and Yosemite, will be free on the first weekend (Saturday and Sunday). The celebration, run by the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation, features events such as night-sky astronomy parties, Revolutionary War programs, Earth Day celebrations, and Junior Ranger activities. Visitors can plan trips at FindYourPark.com and NationalParkWeek.org, then share their experiences with the hashtag #FindYourPark or on FindYourPark.com."
15661,"TEPCO sent a second remote-controlled, shape-shifting robot into a Fukushima Daiichi reactor on April 15 after the first probe, dispatched April 10, stalled 10 m inside when a fallen object blocked its path. The first robot’s cable was cut April 12 after it had gathered radiation data at 14 of 18 planned spots. The second robot completed readings at all 11 scheduled points, finding radiation and temperatures lower than expected—evidence TEPCO says shows cooling systems are working. Its camera recorded a mysterious green glow and yellow discoloration on grating whose cause is unknown; the glow was not visible from other angles. TEPCO labels the mission an unprecedented experiment and views the data as a significant step toward decommissioning, a process projected to take years and cost about $50 billion. Human entry remains unsafe because radiation inside the three damaged reactors is still extremely high."
15665,"After convicting Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on all charges, jurors moved to the sentencing phase, where prosecutors seek the death penalty by detailing the bombings’ human toll. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini presented victim-impact testimony and photos, stressing that Tsarnaev deliberately caused extreme pain and fear. Relatives mourned the four people killed—Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, eight-year-old Martin Richard, and Officer Sean Collier—while survivors described devastating injuries: high-school senior Gillian Reny’s shattered leg and Celeste Corcoran’s double amputation. Jurors also saw a July 2013 holding-cell photo of Tsarnaev defiantly giving the middle finger, which prosecutors cited as proof he is “unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged.”"
15667,"The 50th Academy of Country Music Awards, staged in Dallas’ AT&T Stadium, marked the show’s half-century by setting a Guinness record for the largest audience for a live TV awards broadcast. Billboard’s recap lists:

Best moments  
• Kickoff: Eric Church (“Pledge Allegiance to the Hag”) and Keith Urban (“Raise ’Em Up”).  
• Reba McEntire’s powerhouse performance.  
• Taylor Swift enthusiastically singing in the crowd and later receiving a special award introduced by her mother.  
• Garth Brooks’ “All-American Kid” tribute featuring U.S. military representatives.  
• Christina Aguilera pairing with Rascal Flatts on “Riot.”  
• Miranda Lambert’s high-energy medley and sweep of multiple awards.  
• Little Big Town’s unflinching delivery of “Girl Crush.”  
• Jason Aldean’s vocally strong medley.

Worst moments  
• Dallas Cowboys QB Tony Romo’s drawn-out football gag with hosts Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan.  
• The show’s over-long 3½-hour runtime.  
• Numerous Milestone Awards that felt rushed or excessive.  
• Steven Tyler’s much-noted facial hair.  
• Twitter backlash accusing Taylor Swift of “abandoning” country music.

Overall, the night was notable for its scale, star pairings and record-setting viewership, while suffering from pacing issues and a few misfires."
15670,"Polish aristocrat Prince Jan Zylinski released a YouTube video denouncing UKIP leader Nigel Farage’s anti-immigration rhetoric, especially toward Poles, and challenged Farage to a sword duel in London’s Hyde Park—or alternatively to a televised debate. Holding his father’s WWII sword, Zylinski said he was “fed up” with discrimination and mocked Farage’s claim that migrants cause British traffic jams. 

Farage, campaigning for the May 7 general election, declined the duel; a spokesman said he had no intention of accepting and argued Poland is harmed by losing its young workers. UKIP’s platform calls for Britain to quit the EU, end free movement of labor, and slash the foreign-aid budget; another party member tweeted an image suggesting Farage would win a duel.

Zylinski also posted a second video titled “7 reasons why the British should love the Poles,” highlighting Polish wartime service, strong work ethic, and easy integration, and urging an end to hostility toward Polish immigrants."
15673,"A Cessna 414 carrying seven people crashed overnight Monday about 2 miles east of Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington, roughly 5 miles from Illinois State University (ISU). All aboard were killed, including ISU associate men’s basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch, who were returning from the NCAA men’s championship game in Indianapolis. Ward, a former University of Alabama at Birmingham standout who later played in China, joined ISU’s staff in 2012 and became associate head coach in 2014. Leetch first came to ISU in 2005, left for Whitworth University, and returned in 2013 as deputy athletic director overseeing several programs and communications. ISU President Larry Dietz and Athletic Director Larry Lyons expressed profound grief, calling Ward and Leetch beloved, talented leaders whose loss deeply affects the university community."
15683,"In the sentencing phase of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s trial, prosecutors concluded their case Thursday with harrowing testimony from Boston Marathon bombing survivors and medical experts. 

• Survivor Steve Woolfenden described lying on the ground still clutching his 3-year-old son’s stroller, discovering both Leo’s head wound and his own shredded Achilles, exposed tibia and severed foot. He improvised a tourniquet and was aided by a stranger who carried Leo away.  
• Trauma surgeon Dr. David King, a former Army combat doctor, said the injuries he saw that day matched war-zone IED carnage. He later detailed 8-year-old Martin Richard’s fatal wounds, stating the child likely suffered rapid blood loss and intense visceral pain.  
• Heather Abbott recounted being blown into a restaurant, seeing blood pour from her ruined heel and ultimately choosing a below-knee amputation after three failed attempts to save her foot.  
• Marc Fucarile testified to losing his right leg, suffering severe burns and damage to his left leg, and now taking over 70 pills daily. He once handed his detached leg to a firefighter without remembering it.  

The prosecution’s goal was to portray Tsarnaev as “cold-hearted and remorseless.” The defense, led by Judy Clarke, will begin Monday, likely focusing on Tsarnaev’s upbringing. Jurors must choose between a death sentence and life imprisonment."
15690,"• After ending their May 2014 engagement, actress Sofia Vergara (42) and businessman Nick Loeb are in a Los Angeles court fight over two female embryos they created through IVF in November 2013.  
• Loeb’s anonymous-filed suit—confirmed by his lawyer—asks that the embryos be preserved and eventually implanted in a surrogate; he offers to waive any parental or financial duties for Vergara.  
• The complaint also names the Beverly Hills clinic storing the embryos and seeks an order barring their destruction until the pair agree on their fate.  
• The ex-couple previously tried, unsuccessfully, to use two surrogates.  
• Legal specialists note that without a prior controlling agreement, a court must decide whether the embryos are treated as “life” or property and who holds decision-making rights.  
• Vergara’s representatives have no comment; she is now engaged to actor Joe Manganiello while promoting the film “Hot Pursuit.”"
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, a 65-year-old widow from Luxor, has dressed and worked as a man for 43 years to survive in Egypt’s patriarchal south and raise her only child, Houda. Widowed at 21 and pregnant, she earned money first as a brick maker, then as a shoeshiner, saving enough to educate her daughter and later help support two grandchildren. Her daily male attire—a jalabiya—shielded her from social restrictions; she refuses to abandon it, saying only God may judge her. After a televised interview, Luxor’s governor gave her a kiosk and cash advance, and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi honored her as one of Egypt’s “ideal mothers,” recognizing the sacrifices she made while living as a man to protect and provide for her family."
15695,"A Massachusetts jury spent more than 35 hours over seven days weighing testimony from 130+ witnesses and 400+ exhibits in the murder trial of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez. They found him guilty of first-degree murder for the June 17, 2013 shooting of friend Odin Lloyd, who was hit by six bullets. The verdict brings Hernandez a life-without-parole sentence; co-defendants Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace will be tried later. Jurors said the repeated gunshots and Hernandez’s post-crime “indifference” (e.g., sunbathing hours after the killing) were decisive, and his football fame played no role in their decision. They described the process as emotionally draining and far removed from TV portrayals of courtroom drama, emphasizing the gravity of ending a 25-year-old man’s freedom and the lasting loss to Lloyd’s family."
15696,"SkyWest Flight 5622, an Embraer E170 traveling from Chicago to Hartford, diverted to Buffalo for an emergency landing. After a flight-attendant call for medical help, passengers were warned of a possible pressurization issue; several people grew dizzy and three briefly lost consciousness. Nurse Mary Cunningham treated two affected women but also felt light-headed herself. The plane, carrying 84 passengers (including nine crew members), descended 28,000 feet in three minutes and landed safely; 15 passengers were checked by medical staff, none required hospitalization. SkyWest maintenance later reported no pressurization malfunction, yet the airline, FAA and NTSB are investigating. Passenger Larry Johnson described the episode as terrifying."
15700,"Aaron Hernandez, former New England Patriots tight end, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting of Odin Lloyd and sentenced to life without parole, along with convictions for unlawful firearm and ammunition possession. Throughout the trial he showed swagger rather than remorse, which drew criticism, yet the jury’s verdict rested on extensive circumstantial evidence. Once a standout at the University of Florida and an NFL star with a $40 million contract, Hernandez’s off-field problems—fights, drug issues, and prior police questioning—had long signaled trouble. Commentators note that the Patriots and the NFL acted appropriately, cutting him immediately after his arrest, and that his crime was unpredictable despite standard vetting. The case is viewed as a tragic waste of life for both Lloyd and Hernandez."
15702,"Louis Jordan, 37, set out from Conway, South Carolina, on his 35-ft sailboat “Angel” to fish in the ocean but, a few days in, a storm capsized the boat, broke its mast and fractured his shoulder. Unable to make progress with a makeshift mast, the craft drifted for 66 days, capsizing twice more. Jordan survived by eventually collecting rainwater (filling a 25-gallon tank and a bucket) and netting fish that gathered around clothing he rinsed overboard. On Thursday, hundreds of miles offshore, the container ship Houston Express spotted his badly listing boat; he was brought aboard, given water and pea soup, then flown to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, walking in unaided. Despite his ordeal, he appeared in surprisingly good shape, and the Coast Guard—alerted by his father on January 29—finds no reason to doubt his account."
15708,"• French prosecutor Brice Robin says investigators have seen no onboard video from Germanwings Flight 9525 and asks anyone holding one to hand it over.  
• Magazines Paris Match and Bild claim they viewed a cell-phone video, allegedly retrieved from the wreckage, that captures final screams, banging on the cockpit door and escalating chaos before impact.  
• France’s BEA and Gendarmerie spokesman Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini call the magazines’ reports “completely wrong,” saying recovered phones have not yet been analyzed and none were leaked. Bild’s editor insists the clip is authentic.  
• Lufthansa reveals co-pilot Andreas Lubitz told its flight school in 2009 of a “severe depression” episode; the airline let him resume training and later fly. Medical records show earlier suicidal tendencies and recent visits to an eye doctor and neuropsychologist who deemed him unfit to work, but no proof he was suicidal just before the crash.  
• Investigators are exploring whether fear of losing his license over medical issues motivated Lubitz to deliberately crash the jet, killing all 150 aboard.  
• Recovery teams have removed nearly all visible human remains; DNA identification could finish within a week, and collection of passengers’ personal belongings—including more phones—begins."
15714,"A nuclear submarine under repair in the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire while in dry dock. The blaze began in the rubber insulation between the light and pressure hull, apparently during welding. Nuclear fuel, armaments, and other dangerous materials had already been removed, so authorities say the fire poses no threat; all personnel evacuated safely and no injuries were reported."
15733,"HBO’s critical documentary “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief” has drawn attention, but prominent Scientologist John Travolta says he has not watched it and has no interest in doing so. Speaking to the Tampa Bay Times while premiering his new movie “The Forger” in Clearwater, Florida, Travolta called his 40-year involvement with Scientology wholly positive, attributing the film’s viewpoint to disgruntled former members. He praised the church as “brilliant,” crediting it with helping him cope after his son Jett’s 2009 death, and stated that neither he nor fellow celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise would find the documentary reflective of their experiences."
15735,"At Walt Disney World Speedway’s Exotic Driving Experience on Sunday, a Lamborghini hit a guardrail. Passenger Gary Terry, 36, died at the scene; driver Tavon Watson, 24, suffered minor injuries after losing control. Petty Holdings, which runs the attraction (and the Richard Petty Driving Experience), issued condolences."
15739,"A gastrointestinal outbreak on the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity has sickened 100 people—95 of the 2,117 passengers and 5 of the 964 crew—according to the CDC. The cause is still unknown; two CDC staff will board the ship in San Diego on Monday for investigation. The ship departed San Diego on March 29 and last stopped in Puerto Vallarta on April 10. Celebrity Cruises has stepped up cleaning, informed passengers, and provided samples for CDC testing. This is the vessel’s third such outbreak (previous ones in 2006 and 2013); the ship was built in 2001 and refurbished in 2011."
15740,"Nearly 2,000 pieces of World War I graffiti, carved by soldiers sheltering in an underground chalk quarry near Naours, France (about 120 miles north of Paris), have been documented. National Geographic photographer and ER doctor Jeff Gusky, whose portfolio is titled “The Hidden World of WWI,” has identified 1,821 names—about 40 % Australian, the rest mostly British, 55 American, and 662 still untraced. The quarry forms part of a centuries-old “underground city” that was sealed in the 18th century, rediscovered in the late 19th, and used as a refuge during nearby fighting such as the 1916 Battle of the Somme. Previously on private land, the site came under village consortium control in 2013, enabling exploration of its extensive, maze-like passages and remarkably preserved inscriptions, which offer a poignant human link to soldiers who often died soon after writing them."
15744,"• Rolling Stone has retracted its gang-rape story, but the undisputed backdrop remains: UVA’s handling of sexual assault is under heavy scrutiny.  
• The university has never expelled a student for sexual assault, prompting two probes—a review by law firm O’Melveny & Myers for the Virginia attorney general and a separate federal Title IX investigation.  
• “Jackie” reported an alleged 2012 fraternity-house gang rape to UVA in 2013 and to police only in 2014; she then declined to cooperate, so no case advanced.  
• Other women, citing a campus culture that downplays rape as a “bad experience” and labels some fraternities “rapey,” say internal procedures feel pointless if offenders stay enrolled.  
• After Rolling Stone’s article, UVA announced an undefined “zero-tolerance” sexual-assault policy.  
• Columbia Journalism School found the article’s main error was failing to call Jackie’s friends, whose differing accounts would have been a red flag.  
• Survivors and advocates fear the retraction undermines progress, discouraging victims from reporting, yet agree the controversy has at least forced wider discussion of UVA’s unresolved shortcomings."
15747,"• Jia Jiang, a Chinese-born entrepreneur in the U.S., quit a six-figure job at 30 (just before his first child was born).  
• After his start-up was denied funding he created the blog/experiment “100 Days of Rejection,” deliberately making one unusual request a day (e.g., asking a stranger for $100; requesting Olympic-ring doughnuts at Krispy Kreme—an incident that went viral and brought media attention).  
• The project helped him face his own fear, led to talk-show appearances, speaking invitations, and job offers, and became the basis for his new book “Rejection Proof,” released this week.  
• Jiang’s mission is to show that embracing rejection can turn it into opportunity.  
• His eight key lessons:  
  1. Fear of rejection limits us more than rejection itself; ask anyway and don’t take a “no” personally.  
  2. It’s a numbers game—enough asks eventually yield a yes.  
  3. A rejection doesn’t judge an idea’s merit; it reflects the rejector.  
  4. Don’t flee after a “no”; stay engaged and confident.  
  5. Ask “why,” solve the reason, or propose an intermediate request.  
  6. Decide how many “no’s” you can absorb (his wife used this to land a job at Google).  
  7. Repeated exposure builds “invincibility” to rejection, like strengthening a muscle.  
  8. Stand tall; rejection is just one person’s opinion, shaped by their own mood and background."
15753,"During the past year the largest Ebola outbreak in history infected more than 25,000 people and killed over 10,000. Although the crisis has eased, it exposed weaknesses in public-health systems and left lasting effects on survivors. Weekly infections have fallen sharply: the World Health Organization recorded 30 new cases in the week of April 5—the lowest since May 2014—and overall numbers in Liberia and Sierra Leone are now so low that treatment centers are being closed. Guinea, however, still faces hidden transmission; of 19 Ebola deaths that week, seven were detected only after death and 21 unsafe burials were reported, prompting WHO to warn that undetected chains of infection may persist."
15759,"A defense attorney reflects on the bystander video showing Officer Michael Slager shoot the fleeing Walter Scott, then handcuff him and apparently plant evidence. The footage, he argues, is the only reason the case will likely receive true scrutiny; without it, official self-defense claims might have stood unchallenged. Had Slager been wearing a police body camera, the author believes the officer would probably not have fired, falsified his report, or now face life—or even death— in prison, and Scott would still be alive. Although body-camera programs and data storage are costly, those expenses are minor compared with potential civil-suit damages and, more importantly, the value of a human life. Cameras also help restore waning public trust, as studies show they reduce citizen complaints and police use of force. Still, cameras are only a stop-gap: the deeper problem is a systemic bias that leads officers to view black men as threats and shoot them at disproportionate rates. Long-term solutions require stricter hiring standards, bias-recognition training, and broader social reforms addressing racial disparities, but until those changes take hold, universal police body cameras can at least illuminate and curb the bias that too often proves fatal."
15778,"• Shariya refugee camp near Duhok, Iraqi Kurdistan, holds thousands of Yazidis in roughly 4,000 tents, 18 miles from an ISIS front line.  
• Most residents fled the August ISIS assault on Sinjar; many others were captured. ISIS separated girls as young as eight for sexual slavery and forced men to convert or be killed.  
• Story of one family: while Mahmoud was away, ISIS seized his wife Ahlam, their three small children, and his elderly parents. Robbed and trucked to Tal Afar, they were shuttled among villages, ordered to work herding goats, and held with about 40 other Yazidis.  
• Using a hidden phone, Ahlam occasionally called Mahmoud. Captives who tried to escape were tortured and killed publicly.  
• After ISIS removed the house’s elderly occupants, Ahlam and others fled at midnight; she carried her baby while the older children walked. They reached Kurdish territory at dawn and reunited with Mahmoud after eight months.  
• Days later ISIS unexpectedly freed 217 Yazidis—mostly elderly and children—including Mahmoud’s parents; Ahlam’s parents remain captive.  
• Yazidi MP Vian Dakhil, traveling with Iraq’s prime minister to the UN, is appealing for greater international action and airstrikes, stressing the urgency of rescuing captives.  
• Ahlam was not enslaved because breastfeeding and caring for young children made her “impure,” but she is traumatized by the screams of girls taken away to be sold."
15779,"Debra Lobo, a 55-year-old American vice-principal at Karachi’s Jinnah Medical and Dental College, was shot in the cheek and arm by two men on a motorcycle while driving to collect her daughters. Pamphlets left in her car read “America should be burnt.” She is unconscious but expected to survive and is being treated at Aga Khan Hospital. A California native, Lobo has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Pakistani Christian librarian. Police are investigating, and the U.S. Consulate is coordinating with local authorities."
15786,"While vacationing at the Sirenusa resort in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, Delaware father Steve Esmond, his wife Theresa Devine, and their sons (16 and 14) suddenly fell ill on March 20. Esmond was found unconscious, the others were having seizures, and all were air-lifted to U.S. hospitals. Two weeks later the boys remain in comas, Esmond is conscious but unable to move, and Devine has been released to occupational therapy. Preliminary U.S. EPA tests of their villa detected the banned indoor pesticide methyl bromide, possibly used during a March 18 fumigation of the unit below by Terminix, hired through Sea Glass Vacations. The EPA and U.S. Justice Department are conducting investigations; Terminix says it is cooperating and wishes the family a speedy recovery."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) has formally voted to discourage its members from any role in executions, stating that such involvement conflicts with pharmacists’ healthcare mission. This policy expands on earlier APhA stances that object to calling lethal-injection chemicals “drugs” and oppose laws compelling or permitting pharmacists to take part. The move follows heightened scrutiny of lethal injection, including a botched 2014 Oklahoma execution, a 2015 Supreme Court stay, and Georgia’s recent postponement of an execution over cloudy drugs. Although 32 states still allow capital punishment and lethal injection remains prevalent, drug shortages persist—pentobarbital’s main supplier ended sales for executions in 2011, forcing states to seek compounded alternatives. APhA spokeswoman Michelle Spinnler reiterated that pharmacists should not prepare or supply these substances. The new policy aligns APhA with similar positions held by the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American Board of Anesthesiology."
15791,"A Howard University College of Medicine roundtable held for National Public Health Week linked climate change directly to personal health. President Obama, Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy stressed that rising temperatures and pollution are already worsening illnesses such as asthma; an American Thoracic Society survey found 70 % of doctors see climate change harming patients now. Obama cited Los Angeles’ past smog and subsequent improvements under the Clean Air Act as proof that regulation and innovation can work, and noted firms like Google and Microsoft will turn federal data into real-time air-quality apps to help communities plan and push officials for action. EPA and WHO data highlighted likely regional and demographic differences in risk, projecting 250,000 additional annual deaths from malaria, diarrhea, heat and under-nutrition by 2030-2050, with children, the elderly and developing nations most vulnerable. Although Earth has already warmed 1.4 °F and further warming is expected, a Gallup poll shows only 55 % of Americans believe its effects are occurring; advocates therefore frame the issue as a concrete public-health threat to spur broader support and “bold” climate measures."
15800,"Cyclist Wang Pingan spent 460 days riding 29,200 km through every major Chinese province. Near the trip’s end, his pannier-laden mountain bike was stolen in Shenzhen after he left it locked for 10 minutes. Though police doubted recovery, surveillance footage led them to the thief; the bike, having been resold twice, was returned. Wang—who had vowed to finish on foot rather than replace his “old lover”—can now complete the final leg to Hainan Island using the same bicycle."
15817,"Tens of thousands of people from more than twenty nations now use Libya as the main springboard to Europe—over 80 % of Mediterranean-bound migrants in 2014 passed through its unguarded coast.  

Who is travelling  
• Eritreans and Syrians together accounted for about half of last year’s flow; Eritreans flee indefinite military conscription and repression, Syrians a devastated homeland.  
• Somalis, Nigerians, Malians, Senegalese, Gambians, Guineans and other West Africans join for reasons ranging from Al-Shabaab or Boko Haram violence to deepening poverty and vanishing farmland.  
• A rising minority are African women trafficked for prostitution.

Why they leave  
Push factors dominate: war, dictatorship, economic collapse and, for long-term foreign workers already in Libya, the new threats of militia rule and ISIS killings. Alternative corridors via Israel, Saudi Arabia or Yemen have closed, making Libya “the only way.”

How they travel  
Migrants follow established smuggling relays across deserts and mountains, paying in stages: e.g., about $300 from Agadez (Niger) to southern Libya, up to $5,000 in total from Eritrea to the Mediterranean. Main hubs include Agadez, Khartoum and Tamanrasset. Along the way they face kidnapping, robbery, starvation and tribal or jihadist violence.

At the coast small, loosely linked smuggler groups sell “packages.” Better-off Syrians often secure top-deck spots; poorer Africans are locked below or sent in rubber dinghies with only a compass. Death rates are high—migrants themselves put survival odds as low as 5 %."
11317,"• Religious-freedom bills in Arkansas and Indiana sparked warnings they would legalize anti-gay discrimination.  
• Walmart’s Arkansas-based CEO Doug McMillon publicly asked Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto his state’s bill; Hutchinson then demanded the legislature change the language before he would sign.  
• Walmart’s stance, after its recent pledge to raise wages for 500,000 employees, marks the company as a bellwether of shifting public opinion: once reliably aligned with Republicans, it is increasingly supporting gay-rights and worker issues.  
    – PAC giving: 2004 ‑ $2 million to GOP vs. <$500k to Democrats; 2014 ‑ $1.3 million vs. $970k.  
    – Policy changes: 2011 gender-identity protections; 2014 health benefits for same-sex partners.  
• Business opposition was broad—Apple, NCAA, Angie’s List, NASCAR and others condemned the laws, saying equality is “good for business.”  
• GOP figures split: Tim Pawlenty urges the party to adapt; Jeb Bush softens support; Ted Cruz defends the laws.  
• The episode highlights corporate willingness to intervene on social issues that affect their diverse workforces."
11323,"Easter marks Christ’s Crucifixion (Good Friday) and Resurrection (Easter Sunday), events Christians see as atonement for sin and victory over death. Today the holiday mixes this theology with later add-ons such as the Easter bunny and dyed eggs.

Date and astronomy  
• At the Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325) bishops ruled that Easter is the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox; if that full moon falls on a Sunday, Easter moves one week later.  
• Because the West adopted the Gregorian calendar while Eastern Orthodoxy kept the Julian calendar, the two branches usually celebrate on different Sundays.  
• The shared dependence on the lunar cycle also links Easter’s timing to the Jewish Passover and explains phenomena like this year’s “blood moon” appearing between Good Friday and Easter.

Holy Week observances  
• In Rome, Holy Week ran from Palm Sunday to Easter Sunday Mass in rain-soaked St. Peter’s Square. Pope Francis led multiple services, washed believers’ feet, and in his Urbi et Orbi address urged relief for suffering people in conflicts from Nigeria to Ukraine.  
• In Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulcher—site of Calvary and Christ’s tomb—Catholics and Armenian Christians celebrated Easter, while Eastern Orthodox Christians will do so a week later.

Eggs and bunny  
• The first written link between a bunny and Easter eggs dates to 1682 in Alsace; German immigrants brought the custom to North America in the 1700s.  
• One theory: Lenten egg-eating bans left farmers with many preserved eggs at Easter, prompting games, gifts, and the rabbit tale for children.

Practical tip  
For odor-free egg dyeing, YouTube’s Grant Thompson suggests immersing eggs in hot water mixed with a packet of Kool-Aid; colors are vivid but the mixture stains fabrics.

Happy Easter and Passover!"
11332,"During a Diet budget committee meeting, flamboyant ex-wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki asked whether Japan’s Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had ever scrambled jets against extraterrestrial UFOs or studied alien visitors. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani replied that the ASDF has never encountered any UFOs from outer space; when unidentified objects are detected and fighter jets are launched, they turn out to be birds or other earthly items.  Inoki, who says he once saw a UFO, is famed for his wrestling career (including a 1976 bout with Muhammad Ali), TV appearances, product promotions, diplomatic forays to Iraq and North Korea, and conversion to Islam while still practicing Buddhism.  The exchange echoed a 2007 discussion in which then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered Japan’s legal stance on a hypothetical alien invasion."
11349,"Lauren Hill, the 19-year-old Indiana basketball player who continued competing while battling an inoperable brain tumor, died early Friday. Diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma in 2013, she still honored her commitment to play for Mount St. Joseph University; the NCAA let the school move up its first game so she could take the court, where she scored the opening and closing baskets before a sellout crowd. Hill used her story to raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research through The Cure Starts Now and became a widely celebrated symbol of courage and perseverance. Tributes from her coach Dan Benjamin, university president Tony Artez, former teachers, NCAA President Mark Emmert, LeBron James and many others hailed her optimism and “never give up” spirit, noting the lasting legacy she leaves behind."
11353,"A 20–30-foot fiberglass boat fragment, believed to be debris from Japan’s March 11, 2011 tsunami, was spotted off the Oregon coast and towed to Newport. Inside were yellowtail jack fish native to Japanese waters. Biologists judged the invasive-species risk low. The boat remains will be dried, inspected, and sent to a landfill, while the fish will be housed at the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Richie Benaud, former Australian Test captain and internationally celebrated cricket commentator, has died aged 84 after undergoing treatment for skin cancer. 

As a player, Benaud appeared in 64 Tests, captained Australia from 1958/59 to 1963/64 without losing a series, became the first cricketer to reach both 2,000 Test runs and 200 wickets, and led Australia’s first full tour of India and Pakistan. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.

After retirement he spent more than four decades in the commentary box—most prominently with the BBC—earning global acclaim for his concise, witty style. 

Tributes poured in from figures such as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (who ordered flags flown at half-mast), current captain Michael Clarke, Shane Warne, coach Darren Lehmann, Pakistan’s Imran Khan, Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara, and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, all hailing Benaud as the defining voice and gentleman of cricket."
11356,"NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer has named newly discovered Asteroid 316201—now called 316201 Malala (2010 ML48)—after Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teen Nobel laureate shot by the Taliban for advocating girls’ education. Mainzer, noting that few asteroids honor women, especially women of color, chose Malala to “immortalize” her achievements. The dark, 4-km-wide asteroid orbits between Mars and Jupiter, completing a solar circuit every 5½ years. Mainzer links the tribute to Malala’s belief that educating girls maximizes global human potential."
11366,"A woman left an explosives-filled handbag beside a bus at Bauchi Motor Park in Gombe, northeast Nigeria, around 8:30 p.m. Thursday. The device detonated as the bus—which was bound for Jos—was loading passengers, igniting the vehicle, killing at least five people, and seriously injuring more than a dozen (some losing limbs or an eye). Witnesses said the woman pretended to be a passenger, walked away, and disappeared moments before the blast. Although no group has claimed responsibility, Boko Haram—known for targeting bus stations and markets and recently weakened by regional military offensives—is considered the prime suspect. The bombing is the first such attack since last weekend’s presidential election won by Muhammadu Buhari, who has pledged to defeat the militants."
11370,"At the Panama Summit of the Americas, the headline moment was President Obama’s first in-person handshake with Cuban President Raúl Castro after announcing plans to normalize relations. Obama, however, wants the meeting to mark broader progress: the United States has been losing regional influence to China, Russia and Iran, and must use the summit to rebuild ties with Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Past summits hurt U.S. standing—the 2009 Hugo Chávez book incident and the 2012 Cartagena Secret Service prostitution scandal, coupled with Washington’s earlier refusal to include Cuba—so avoiding new missteps is vital. Obama’s opening to Cuba helps, but fresh sanctions on Venezuela have handed President Nicolás Maduro propaganda against the U.S. With democratic norms eroding in several countries, Obama has an opening to align publicly with Latin Americans’ desires for prosperity, democracy, human rights and rule of law. Demonstrating that partnership—illustrated by his meeting with Cuban dissidents—could leave a legacy deeper than a single handshake."
11384,"The author recalls being groped at age 13 in a packed Mumbai train and keeping silent for 25 years. Such harassment remains common: men masturbate on buses, stalk women online and off, take illicit photos, and subject women to leering and cat-calls. A “We the People” study found 80 % of Mumbai women have faced street harassment, mainly in crowded transit areas. Because society equates sexual violence only with rape, milder-seeming acts are ignored, prompting women to restrict their movements or dress. In workshops run by the author, almost all of 2,000 participants had been harassed, yet fewer than ten ever reported it. Legal protections exist, but cultural shame and police indifference deter complaints. Still, two high-profile cases—the allegations against climate leader Rajendra Pachauri and media owner Tarun Tejpal—show that speaking out can have consequences for powerful offenders. The author urges women to break their silence and use available allies and laws to confront harassment."
11395,"Climbers are back on Mount Everest after the 2014 avalanche that killed 16 Nepali Sherpas and ended that season. To lower risk, the Sherpa-run route committee has switched from the faster but avalanche-prone path to a longer central route through the Khumbu Icefall; it avoids last year’s accident zone but requires crossing more crevasses and using extra ladders, so gear weight limits are advised. Nepal has issued 347 climbing permits (including 125 carried over), slightly up from 334 last year. Safety worries are prompting some teams, such as Alpenglow Expeditions, to abandon the Nepal side in favor of Tibet’s northern route, which lacks an icefall; 320 climbers have registered there, 136 more than in 2014. Nepali operators fear losing vital tourism income, while Sherpa guides face renewed danger and family anxiety. Several mountaineers, including Jon Reiter, are nonetheless returning, drawn back despite last year’s tragedy."
11400,"“Get-tested” enthusiasm is spreading: Mark Cuban urges quarterly comprehensive blood work, Taylor Swift promotes cancer screening, and Arizona now lets residents order any lab test without a doctor. Over 1,000 Medicare-listed lab tests—and new walk-in/online outlets—fuel a booming self-testing market. Yet for basically healthy people, mass testing mainly produces “abnormal” results that are usually harmless but trigger doctor visits, more tests, anxiety, invasive procedures, overtreatment (e.g., prostate, breast, thyroid cancers), and higher costs; it won’t save money and can do harm. Diagnostic tests are invaluable for real illness, but routine testing of the well rarely improves health. The author calls for FDA oversight and public education to curb “snake-oil” testing, stressing that exercising the freedom to self-test isn’t necessarily wise—just as carrying a gun doesn’t automatically make one safer."
11410,"Canada’s military has extended its anti-ISIS mission from Iraq into Syria. On Wednesday, two CF-18 Hornets carried out Canada’s first Syrian airstrike, successfully hitting an ISIS garrison near Raqqa, according to the Department of National Defence. The attack follows Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s recent decision to broaden the mandate and adds to the dozens of Canadian strikes already conducted in Iraq since November. Defence Minister Jason Kenney said the action shows Canada’s resolve to counter “a genocidal terrorist organization.” All aircraft returned safely; casualty figures are unknown. Canada remains part of the wider U.S.-led coalition conducting air operations and other support against ISIS across Iraq and Syria."

11779,"• Justice Department filings announce a new policy letting U.S. citizens and permanent residents know if they are on the FBI-run no-fly list and letting them contest that status.

• Change follows a June 2014 federal court ruling, in an ACLU suit for 13 Americans, that the previous secrecy violated the Fifth Amendment’s due-process guarantee.

• Old procedure supplied only a boiler-plate letter that neither confirmed nor denied list inclusion; now, travelers who seek redress through DHS TRIP will:
  – Be told if they are on the list.  
  – May request added details; the government will give an unclassified summary of the “specific criterion” behind the listing when feasible.  
  – Can submit written arguments and evidence; TSA will issue a final written decision.

• The ACLU says the revised process still withholds adequate notice, evidence, and a hearing, and plans to challenge it again.

• The no-fly list’s size is classified; a 2012 figure cited about 21,000 names, roughly 500 of them Americans."
11791,"Texas veterinarian Kristen Lindsey posted a Facebook photo of herself holding a cat she had killed with an arrow, calling it her “first bow kill” and joking about a “vet of the year award.” The image sparked widespread outrage: phone lines and the website of her employer, Washington County Animal Clinic, were overwhelmed; complaints poured into local police and animal control. An animal rescuer claimed the cat was a missing pet named “Tiger,” not a feral cat. Amid the backlash, Lindsey was fired, her name was covered on the clinic’s sign, and she shut down her Facebook page. Authorities in Austin County are investigating, and animal-rights group Alley Cat Allies is offering a $7,500 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. While many demand charges, some clients publicly defended her character."
11795,"A video from CNN affiliate WMAR shows an unidentified mother forcefully pulling her masked son from the Baltimore riots after seeing him on TV throwing rocks at police. She repeatedly hits him and yells for him to leave the crowd, eventually exposing his face. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts publicly thanked the mother, saying he wished more parents would take similar action."
11808,"A CNN team traveled 30 km east of Kathmandu to Ravi Opi in Kavre District and found severe earthquake destruction and little outside assistance. The highway out of the capital is torn by large fissures, making the short drive nearly two hours; conditions are expected to worsen in more remote areas. Village officials say about 90 % of Ravi Opi’s homes are now uninhabitable, landslides have occurred and residents work the fields while living in improvised shelters, fearful of continuing aftershocks.

Personal losses highlight the crisis:  
• Maili Tamang, 62, was injured when her two-story house collapsed; her daughter-in-law also escaped after being trapped and taken 12 km to a missionary hospital.  
• Mahesh Koiraba, 31, dug through rubble to reach his 2-year-old daughter Prati, who died when their home fell.  

Displaced families report no government or aid agency support, lacking food, clothing and secure shelter. Reporters Arwa Damon (on scene) and Euan McKirdy (Hong Kong) note that even closer to the capital, needs remain unmet, and damage in harder-to-reach villages is still unknown."

Accompanying himself on piano, he performed a parody of Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud,” humorously claiming additional “powers” such as a scarf-and-beret collection, trombone skills, and the ability to open pickle jars. The Billboard piece notes Renner’s broader career, citing both Avengers films, The Hurt Locker, American Hustle, and entries in the Bourne and Mission Impossible franchises."

Psylocke, created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe, debuted in the “Captain Britain” comics of the 1970s–’80s and has been a long-standing member of the X-Men and related titles. Munn, represented by Creative Artists Agency and Atlas Artists, joins the project shortly after the movie also added fan-favorite Jubilee to its roster."
11826,"Stephen Hawking has teamed up with Monty Python to release a new version of the 1983 “Galaxy Song” from The Meaning of Life. Issued as a 7-inch single for Record Store Day, the track is accompanied by a video in which Brian Cox criticizes the song’s scientific accuracy until Hawking rolls in, knocks him over, and performs the number in his computerized voice before soaring off into space. Written by Eric Idle and John Du Prez, the song playfully explains the scale of the universe. Hawking’s rendition is downloadable, adding to his previous musical cameo on Pink Floyd’s “Talkin’ Hawkin’.”"
11838,"The author recalls being 12 at a 1980 Miami protest over the acquittal of officers who killed Arthur McDuffie; that protest turned into the first large U.S. race riot since the 1960s. She links Miami to earlier and later eruptions—Harlem 1964, Watts 1965, Newark and Detroit 1967, post-King riots 1968, Los Angeles 1992 (Rodney King), and Baltimore 2015 (Freddie Gray)—all triggered by perceived unjust police actions. 

While raised on the power of youthful, non-violent activism, she now sees how some youths feel riots are their only voice. Moderating a panel titled “Riot—The Voice of the Unheard?” she learned that riots can be deliberate uprisings born of hopelessness and that past riots sometimes spurred reforms: the Kerner Commission (1968) and Christopher Commission (1991) both cited systemic racism, poverty, and police abuse. She cites Dr. King’s warning that condemning riots without condemning their causes is “morally irresponsible.”

Baltimore youths who spoke of a “purge” misunderstood accountability, yet Reverend Jamal Bryant’s church offered them non-violent guidance. Recent mostly peaceful Ferguson protests led to a Justice Department report urging nationwide police reforms. The Baltimore violence has ended, but peaceful voices persist, underscoring that lasting change follows sustained, non-violent pressure and governmental action on underlying injustices."
11839,"Israeli forces carried out airstrikes Sunday night in the occupied Golan Heights after four militants crossed from Syria and tried to plant a bomb near the border. The strikes, aimed at preventing the attack, reportedly killed three of the men. Their affiliation is unknown. The Golan Heights—seized from Syria in the 1967 war, later annexed by Israel, and home to about 41,000 Jews, Druze, and Alawites—is still viewed internationally as occupied territory."

A short, truth-telling dialogue between her friends Albert and Bernard supplies clues allowing deduction of the single correct date. The viral puzzle has been likened to the dress-color debate and has spawned explanatory solutions from sources such as Georgia Tech mathematician Matt Baker, The New York Times, and The Washington Post."
11858,"Since mid-December a “severe” HIV outbreak tied to injection of the prescription opioid Opana has hit rural Scott and Jackson counties in Indiana. By Friday 142 people had tested positive (136 confirmed, six preliminary) in communities with only a few thousand residents and minimal HIV care (Scott County has one non-specialist infectious-disease physician). The CDC and state officials attribute the surge to frequent needle sharing—Opana often requires 4-10 injections a day with large-gauge needles—and to limited awareness among younger users. Indiana has declared a public-health emergency, opened a once-weekly volunteer clinic (33 patients so far), launched door-to-door education, offered job services, and authorized a 30-day needle-exchange program that Governor Mike Pence has now extended another 30 days. Officials warn the episode illustrates how quickly HIV and related infections such as hepatitis C (up 150% nationally from 2010-2013) can spread among IV drug users if vigilance lapses."

11870,"A new book, “Clinton Cash” (out May 5) is expected to intensify scrutiny of whether foreign governments and businesses used donations and speaking fees to gain favor with Bill or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Examples cited include 2014 gifts from the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Oman and Canada’s foreign-affairs ministry—which was promoting the Keystone XL pipeline—as well as sponsorships from at least six banks then under federal investigation. Although no proof of a quid-pro-quo has surfaced and CNN reporting notes no evidence the Clintons knew of the banks’ probes, the appearance of influence remains troubling. The Clinton Foundation and its offshoots have also been criticized for poor management, large deficits ($40 million in 2007-08; $8 million in 2012), and past dealings with fraudster Raffaello Follieri. Clinton’s team is likely to keep her focused on voter concerns such as jobs and schools, betting that, absent a “smoking gun,” these controversies will be dismissed as political “distractions.” A Rasmussen poll still shows 57 % expecting her to win in 2016."

Law-enforcement leaders say this tool helps speeders, drunk drivers, gang members and even potential killers locate or avoid police, citing Ismaaiyl Brinsley’s use of Waze before murdering two New York officers in December 2014. Although Google defends Waze as serving the “common good,” it has refused to meet with the National Sheriffs’ Association to address safety concerns.

Over five weeks in Western Sahara—a little-reported, 40-year conflict zone between Morocco and the Polisario Front—Thorpe staged real Polisario soldiers on oil-drum platforms and photographed them to resemble green plastic toy figures against historic desert battle sites.  The landscape photographer, working with 50–60 troops at a time and requiring Polisario clearance, aimed to create a visual metaphor that jolts viewers into recognizing the human reality behind familiar war pictures and to question future attention spans for such images.

The suspect is 20-year-old former student and onetime print-shop employee Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, whom police describe as “armed and dangerous” and who remains at large. Tear gas was used while rooms were searched, mistakenly affecting someone who was not the shooter. College President Kay Albertson lamented the loss and commended emergency responders.

11910,"Wisconsin ended Kentucky’s 38-0 season Saturday, winning 71-64 in the Final Four at Indianapolis. Frank Kaminsky had 20 points and 11 rebounds, Sam Dekker 16 points, and the Badgers erased a 60-56 deficit with a late 8-0 run; Kentucky, led by Karl-Anthony Towns’ 16 points, went scoreless for five minutes. Wisconsin outrebounded the taller Wildcats by 12 and will seek its first national title since 1941.

In the other semifinal, Duke overpowered Michigan State 81-61. Justise Winslow scored 19, Jahlil Okafor 18, and Quinn Cook 17 as the Blue Devils turned an early 8-point hole into a 36-25 halftime lead and never looked back. Denzel Valentine had 22 points and 11 rebounds for the Spartans.

• Closing the gap could lift half of single working mothers out of poverty and boost economic growth by putting money into spenders’ pockets.  
• An article urges presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to dramatize the issue: pledge, if elected, to accept a 23 % cut to the $400,000 presidential salary—mirroring the wage gap—until pay equity is achieved.  
• The proposed “political stunt” would align Clinton’s populist campaign message with concrete symbolism, counter doubts about her wealth and elite background, and spotlight nationwide pay inequity."
11945,"The passage describes how today’s Islamist groups, notably ISIS and its Nigerian ally Boko Haram, make the abuse of women a central, strategic tool rather than a by-product of war. Beyond killing male enemies, they kidnap and enslave women—Yazidis in Iraq and thousands of girls in Nigeria—placing them in “slave warehouses,” forcing conversions, marriages, and repeated sexual assault. Human Rights Watch has documented these acts as organized rape, sexual slavery, and potential crimes against humanity. Unlike earlier jihadists such as al-Qaeda, which saw a future caliphate as distant, ISIS and Boko Haram need women immediately to populate and run their envisioned Sharia-ruled communities; therefore, women are systematically incorporated, not discarded. Propaganda justifies this treatment as compliant with Islamic law, reserving the harshest brutality for non-Muslims, though Muslim women in captured areas also lose basic freedoms and live in extreme fear—conditions that drive some to attempt suicide. The cruelty is methodical, aimed at cementing control and building the desired society."
11948,"SpaceX has rescheduled its sixth cargo mission to the International Space Station for Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET after poor weather canceled Monday’s attempt. A two-stage Falcon 9 will launch from Cape Canaveral, carrying the uncrewed Dragon spacecraft and 4,300 lb of supplies (including an espresso maker). 

The key experiment comes after liftoff: SpaceX will try to land the rocket’s first stage upright on an autonomous drone ship in the Atlantic—something never achieved before. Reusing boosters, Elon Musk argues, could cut launch costs by up to 100-fold. A January test crash-landed, and current success odds are pegged at 50%, but the company plans to keep trying and eventually shift to ground landings.

Post-launch sequence:
• Upper stage places Dragon in orbit, then burns up on re-entry.  
• Dragon docks with the ISS about two days later.  
• Crew unloads cargo over five weeks, then refills Dragon with 3,000+ lb of return items.  
• Dragon splashes down in the Pacific off California.

SpaceX was the first private firm to dock with the ISS and will share mission photos and video online."
11979,"Jurors in the Boston Marathon bombing trial deliberated for more than seven hours Tuesday without reaching a verdict and will return Wednesday with two questions for the court. Defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, faces 30 federal counts—17 punishable by death or life in prison—for the April 15, 2013 attacks that killed 8-year-old Martin Richard, graduate student Lingzi Lu, and restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, and for later crimes that included the fatal shooting of MIT Officer Sean Collier.  

Prosecutors presented graphic videos, photos, eyewitness testimony and evidence of extremist writings to argue that Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan, who died during a police shoot-out, deliberately chose the crowded Patriots’ Day marathon to “terrorize this country.” They described two pressure-cooker bombs packed with nails and BBs—Tamerlan’s near Marathon Sports and Dzhokhar’s outside the Forum restaurant—and detailed Tsarnaev’s boat-side manifesto condemning U.S. policies toward Muslims.  

The defense conceded Tsarnaev’s involvement but contended he was a misguided 19-year-old dominated by the older, radicalized Tamerlan, urging jurors to spare his life. If Tsarnaev is convicted on any capital count, the trial will move to a penalty phase weighing aggravating versus mitigating factors."
12008,"The author explores whether the U.S. is headed toward a “marriage apocalypse.”  
• Kent State journalism students say they will marry only if it suits them; career goals, travel and avoiding debt come first.  
   – Candace Monacelli: spent four years on a degree, not a “housewife.”  
   – Jackie Demate would rather spend wedding money on Europe and is “OK being single forever.”  
   – Emily Crille cites heavy student debt as a barrier to weddings.  
• These attitudes arise amid widespread divorce: 42 million Americans have married more than once (14 million in 1960; 22 million in 1980). Today 23 % of married adults are remarried versus 13 % in 1960.  
• Pew Research: 50 % of Americans—and 66 % of 18-to-29-year-olds—say society is just as well off if people put other priorities ahead of marriage and children.  
• Economists link marriage to economic well-being (two incomes), yet note that financial security can also make someone “marriageable.” Millennials prefer partners who are debt-free and hesitate to add their own debts to a union.  
• Scandinavia shows an advanced version of this shift: in Norway 82 % of couples have their first child outside wedlock; marriage offers few legal or social advantages, and secular values lessen pressure to wed.  
• Both Swedes interviewed and the U.S. students view marriage as optional and valid only when rooted in love, not expectation.  
• The author, once wary of marriage herself, ultimately wed at 38 for both love and practical reasons, but concedes she is unsure whether a society without marriage would fare better or worse."
12060,"Iraqi government troops, supported by about 20,000 Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen and U.S-led airstrikes, have seized control of Tikrit after nine months of ISIS rule. While pockets of militants remain and hundreds of booby-trapped vehicles and buildings are still being disarmed, officials say full control is imminent. The victory—achieved after earlier failed attempts—follows brutal ISIS abuses in the city, including the massacre of more than 1,500 air-force cadets. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited Tikrit to declare success and vowed to replicate the tactics elsewhere, aiming next at Mosul. Authorities worry, however, that potential reprisals by Shiite militias against Tikrit’s largely Sunni population could reignite sectarian tensions and undermine the gains."
12068,"• The International Committee of the Red Cross urged an immediate 24-hour ceasefire—especially around Aden—to bring in food, water, medical supplies and staff, warning that the wounded may die within hours without help.

• Heavy Saudi-led coalition airstrikes continued, with Sanaa experiencing its fiercest bombardment yet and military sites hit; ground clashes in Aden remain intense.

• The U.N. Security Council met as Russia proposed a draft resolution to stop the air campaign, but the session ended without agreement; diplomats said the text omitted demands for Houthi restraint or political talks.

• Conflict timeline: Houthi rebels forced President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from Sanaa in January; he fled to Aden, then to Saudi Arabia when rebels advanced. Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states have since been bombing Houthi positions and, according to a Saudi source, have inserted special forces and equipment to aid Hadi loyalists in Aden.

• Human toll (UN figures): at least 519 killed and 1,700 wounded nationwide in the past two weeks; tens of thousands have fled abroad. Aden alone has seen 58 dead and 200 injured in two days.

• Additional complications: al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula controls eastern areas; militants freed senior leader Khaled Batarfi and 270 others in al Mukallah. France evacuated 44 people from the port city of Balhaf."
12073,"Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was filmed berating an Uber driver after the driver signaled for him to use a blinker while parking. In the viral video, Cherry curses, mocks the driver’s accent, claims multiple traffic violations and says the only reason the driver is not arrested is because “you’re not important enough.” Commissioner William Bratton called the behavior “unacceptable,” placed Cherry on modified assignment and apologized to the driver; the Internal Affairs Bureau and Civilian Complaint Review Board are investigating. Cherry, who holds top-secret clearance, publicly apologized to the driver and the commissioner, acknowledging he hurt community relations. Possible outcomes include suspension, reassignment or loss of clearance. Mayor Bill de Blasio criticized discriminatory language, while Detectives’ Endowment Association president Michael Palladino asked the public to judge Cherry’s full record, not this “isolated incident.” Uber expressed support for its driver."

13816,"Xanax (alprazolam), a benzodiazepine that boosts the calming neurotransmitter GABA, works quickly and can effectively relieve acute anxiety episodes. However, prolonged use risks tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal, often requiring ever-higher doses. Because of these drawbacks, sustained anxiety management is usually better achieved through therapy, lifestyle changes, or alternative medications, with Xanax reserved for cautious, short-term use under professional supervision. Overall, the article urges a balanced, holistic approach and dispels exaggerated claims about Xanax’s long-term effectiveness."

Bowie currently refuses to name Cameron as a replacement nominee but is also reluctant to strike at Cory. Power of Veto competitors are Bowie, Felicia, Cirie, Jag Bains, Matt Klotz, and America Lopez, with Cory hosting.

George Santos after 23 new federal criminal counts—including identity theft and unauthorized credit-card charges—were filed against him. They argue Santos is unfit to serve, citing the charges and earlier claims he fabricated his résumé. The House must vote on the motion in the coming week, but Republican leaders, facing a narrow 221-212 majority, could instead table it or send it to committee. Expulsion requires 290 votes; even with full Democratic support, 78 Republicans would need to break ranks. Santos says he will not resign, and the controversy is expected to persist regardless of the outcome."
13842,"Survivor host Jeff Probst has replaced the old, confusing sit-out policy with a simple rule: a player who sits out one challenge must compete in the next—no exceptions. The change was needed because the modern 26-day seasons feature fewer challenges per cycle, which previously let some castaways (notably Claire Rafson in Survivor 44) skip multiple Immunity Challenges in a row, angering fans and players. Probst announced the new rule in Survivor 45, Episode 2, and discussed it on his On Fire podcast. The current 90-minute episodes (a schedule choice tied to ongoing Hollywood strikes) give viewers more footage, while standard show details remain: past episodes stream on Paramount+ and new ones air Wednesdays at 8/7c on CBS."

• The same Pentagon assessment warns of broader Chinese military expansion: a projected nuclear-warhead stockpile rising from 500 today to about 1,000 by 2030; construction of silo fields for 300+ new ICBMs; and exploration of conventionally armed intercontinental missiles capable of striking the United States.  
• China’s navy, already the world’s largest at roughly 370 vessels, is expected to grow to about 435 by 2030.

• How it will appear: Phones will vibrate, sound the historic 1963 alert tone, and display “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.” (Spanish version also provided). Radio and TV will broadcast the same tone and message.

• Purpose and frequency: FEMA runs these nationwide tests every three years to check system reliability; the last was on August 11, 2021. If major events or severe weather intervene, the backup date is October 11.

• Who might miss it: Devices that are turned off, in airplane mode, out of cell range, or certain older phones may not receive the alert, and calls in progress can block it.

• Regulatory note: The FCC enforces strict rules on using the alert tones; misuse recently led to a proposed fine against FOX.

Bottom line: Expect a brief, harmless test alert on October 4 designed to ensure the nation’s emergency warning systems work properly."

She confirmed on Twitter that she has shot her first episode back and will appear on screen “in a few more weeks,” placing Chelsea’s return to Genoa City around mid-to-late November, given the show’s six-to-eight-week production lead time. Chelsea left town to stay with her mother for Connor, and her comeback will intersect with ongoing storylines involving Billy, Adam, her new job at Marchetti with Summer, and the future of her relationship with Billy."
13972,"Eric Forrester, despite being told by Dr. Colin Colby that he is dying from an unspecified illness, insists on staging a high-stakes couture showdown against his son Ridge as his “final hurrah.” He conceals his worsening condition—marked by coughing up blood—from most of his family; only his wife Donna Logan knows and urges him to stop. Eric’s refusal to rest and his determination to complete the fashion show may lead to a medical crisis during the event, setting up potentially tragic consequences in the week of October 23 on The Bold and the Beautiful."
13979,"The Formula 1 Heineken Silver Las Vegas Grand Prix returns the sport to Las Vegas for the first time in 40 years and is set for the night of 18 November 2023 as the 1100th World Championship round. Run on a new temporary street circuit that includes a 2 km stretch of the Strip, the track is described as 3.8 miles long with 17 corners, three straights and three DRS zones, though the final FIA-approved layout is also noted as a 14-turn high-speed design. Teams will bring low-downforce Monza-Spa aero packages to maximize speed. Racing after dark both avoids daytime heat and showcases the city’s illuminated skyline."
13495,"California trafficker Luis Alfredo Jacobo was given four concurrent life sentences (one for directing a continuing criminal enterprise, three for drug conspiracies) plus four years for 21 communications-related counts. From 2016-2021 Jacobo ran three linked methamphetamine rings that moved shipments as large as 200 lb from Mexican suppliers through California to Oklahoma and Missouri, using more than a dozen associates and mailing or driving cash—sometimes $100,000 at a time—back to California. Key evidence included texts, financial records, and seizures such as 231 lb of meth and $465,000 from an Oklahoma storage unit, and codefendant Tony Garcia’s arrest with 30 lb of meth and a handgun. The case stemmed from OCDETF Operation “Pullin Chains,” led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and DEA."
13499,"• On Oct. 1 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Laphonza Butler to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Senator Dianne Feinstein’s death on Sept. 29, 2023.  
• Butler, president of EMILY’s List and a longtime labor and Democratic strategist, will serve until the Nov. 2024 election.  
• She is the first openly Black lesbian to serve in the Senate.  
• Her past roles include advising Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign, leading SEIU California, working as Airbnb’s North America public-policy director, and partnering at the consulting firm SCRB Strategies; she has also been a UC Regent and served on boards such as the Children’s Defense Fund and BLACK PAC.  
• Though currently residing in Maryland, Butler owns a California home and will change her voter registration."
13503,"On the night of October 20–21, 2023, a weak coronal mass ejection unexpectedly produced vivid Northern Lights over parts of the U.S. Midwest and Northern Plains, with sightings in Minnesota, Michigan, southern Wisconsin, North Dakota, and even Omaha, Nebraska. Because the CME’s solar wind speeds were low, standard monitoring charts showed no sharp spike, so many aurora watchers overlooked it. Subtle indicators—a brief data gap in satellite readings, a slight rise in solar wind, and a gradual shift to negative Bz—were the main clues, which observer Charlie Bourdo noticed in advance. Bourdo has released a video tutorial on forecasting auroras, shared via Limitless Media’s social channels."
13522,"Savannah Chrisley has begun dating former Auburn football player Robert Shiver and recently went on a double date with him, her brother Grayson Chrisley, and Grayson’s girlfriend at a Zach Bryan concert. It is Savannah’s first serious relationship since her split from ex-fiancé Nic Kerdiles. Now guardian to Grayson and their younger relative Chloe while parents Todd and Julie Chrisley serve prison sentences, Savannah values that Robert—who has children himself—understands her family responsibilities. Speaking publicly, she expressed gratitude for the relationship and hopes to protect it, noting that Robert must finalize his divorce before they can consider a more serious future."
13535,"Spoiler recap for The Bold and the Beautiful:

• Intern Luna (Lisa Yamada)—revealed to be Li Flannigan’s niece—fears RJ Forrester is overwhelmed by Eric Forrester’s serious, undisclosed illness.  
• Ignoring RJ’s wish to wait until after Eric’s fashion line debuts, Luna informs Ridge Forrester of Eric’s diagnosis and admits RJ already knew.  
• Ridge explodes at RJ for withholding the news but then tells his son to forgive Luna, calling her action “the right thing.”  
• The storyline leaves two open questions: Will RJ forgive Luna, and what exactly motivates her to betray his confidence?"
13554,"Cristina Michelle Husbands, 48, of Dallas, Texas, was sentenced to 64 months in federal prison, five years of supervised release, and $481,140 in restitution for a multi-state bank-fraud conspiracy. Between November 2021 and April 2022 she used forged IDs to withdraw funds—totaling at least $108,000 from Regions Bank accounts in Mississippi—while participating in a broader scheme that stole hundreds of thousands from banks in Mississippi, Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Texas. Husbands, who said she was coerced while homeless and addicted to drugs, was recruited at shelters and clinics and was already jailed in Texas on related charges at the time of her federal arrest. U.S. District Judge Sul Ozerden imposed the sentence; Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie prosecuted the case. Husbands apologized in court and still faces similar charges elsewhere."
13558,"Texas Democratic Representative Eddie Morales, whose district spans parts of El Paso, Del Rio, and Eagle Pass, told Fox 4 that the Biden administration is not adequately supporting border states amid near-record migrant crossings (about 100,000 shy of last year’s 2,378,944 total). Morales proposes that each migrant pay a $2,000 “initial processing fee,” receiving a non-voting RFID-enabled ID that could also function as a credit card. He argues this could fund border management—estimating $3.2 million per day, or over $1.2 billion a year, from the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector alone—and facilitate legal, temporary labor agreements between Texas and Mexican governors."
13569,"Jag Bains, already this week’s HOH, also won the Week 12 Power of Veto—his fifth consecutive competition victory (three POVs, two HOHs). He has nominated Blue Kim and America Lopez, intends to keep nominations the same, and is targeting Blue for eviction. With only four eviction votes, Jag currently has Bowie Jane and Matt supporting Blue’s ouster; Cirie is expected to keep Blue, while Felicia would likely vote Blue out, giving Jag the needed third vote. Blue’s eviction therefore appears imminent. Looking ahead, a double eviction is coming: Jag cannot play in the next HOH, so he will rely on Matt winning that HOH to avoid becoming the next target."
13577,"Hope informs Brooke that Deacon is romantically involved with Sheila, a fact Hope discovered after seeing Sheila at Deacon’s apartment and hearing Finn confirm it. Shocked, Brooke confronts Deacon; he admits the relationship and insists Sheila can change, but Brooke warns he risks losing everyone if he continues with her. Brooke then tells Ridge, who reveals he has known about Deacon and Sheila for some time but kept quiet to spare Brooke’s feelings."

15619,"Late Thursday, a domestic-kidnapping case sparked two linked shootings. A guard at the U.S. Census Bureau gates in Suitland, Maryland, was shot and left in extremely critical condition after confronting a vehicle with two people arguing. The suspect fled, exchanged gunfire during a police chase, crashed on Washington’s H Street, and was wounded along with an officer; both remained conscious. The kidnapping victim was safely located, and no identities were released."
15647,"The California Department of Public Health has declared the measles outbreak that began in December officially over. Forty-two days have passed since the last B3-strain case—two full incubation periods. In total, 131 Californians contracted the B3 strain and five others had a different genotype. Vaccination data were available for 81 of the 131 patients; 70 % of those were unvaccinated. The outbreak originated with visitors to two Disney theme parks, with 42 cases occurring from December 17–20. Rapid case investigations, contact tracing, targeted vaccinations, and heightened provider awareness helped end the spread. Two April rash cases were found to involve a different genotype and are not considered part of this outbreak."
15748,"Jill (Duggar) Dillard—the first married daughter from TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting”—gave birth Monday to a 9-pound, 10-ounce son, Israel David, with husband Derick. The baby arrived more than a week past his due date, a delay Jill, a student midwife, had anticipated. Her parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, shared a video of the new family on Facebook. While Jill begins motherhood, eldest brother Josh already has three children and a fourth expected in July."
15777,"Airline pilots usually separate personal issues from cockpit duties, and if depression arises it is now treatable without ending a U.S. pilot’s career. Andreas Lubitz, co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, suffered from far more severe psychiatric problems.  
Red flags should have been visible:  
• His behavior would have been evident during glider flying, Lufthansa’s highly competitive selection process, and the rigorous, closely supervised MPL training program (about 250 hours of instruction costing him ≈ $76,000).  
• He even took an unusual training leave and disclosed prior depression, yet no action followed.  
• Cockpit colleagues, who routinely sense when something is “off,” apparently reported nothing.  

Added pressures—low pay and longer duty days at Germanwings, recent pilot labor disputes, and possibly limited medical-leave benefits—may have intensified stress on the 27-year-old. The author concludes the crash was an “accident waiting to happen” and stresses the goal of accident investigation is to keep such tragedies from recurring."
15782,"Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a 23-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Columbus, Ohio, pleaded not guilty to federal counts of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI. Prosecutors allege he:

• Became a U.S. citizen in February 2014, obtained a passport, and in April 2014 flew toward Greece but diverted through Istanbul to Syria.  
• Trained there with al-Nusra Front in firearms, explosives, break-ins, and hand-to-hand combat.  
• Was instructed by a cleric to return to the United States to carry out a terrorist attack.  
• Planned to kill Americans—especially U.S. soldiers—by assaulting a military base (with a prison attack as a backup), specifying interest in executing three or four soldiers at a Texas base.  
• Expressed satisfaction that his brother Aden had died fighting for al-Nusra and said he hoped to join him in death soon.

Mohamud was remanded into custody; his attorney, Sam Shamansky, said he expects a vigorous defense."
15784,"• After Eric Harris’ fatal April 2 shooting in Tulsa, Sheriff Stanley Glanz reassigned the two deputies who pinned Harris and were heard saying “F*ck your breath,” citing threats against them and their families.  
• The sheriff’s drug unit operations are suspended while the incident is reviewed; any formal review of the deputies’ conduct may wait until after Reserve Deputy Robert Bates’ court case.  
• Bates, 73, is charged with second-degree manslaughter for firing his handgun after shouting “Taser, Taser,” claims the shooting was accidental, is free on $25,000 bond, and has apologized to Harris’ family.  
• Glanz apologized to the family, said the FBI found no civil-rights violation, and insists Bates met training standards, denying allegations of forged records though bringing in an outside consultant for another policy review.  
• Harris’ family asserts the case shows a “deep-seated problem” in the department and demands justice and reforms."
11350,"Authorities say Carlos Colina, 32, of Massachusetts will be arraigned on April 14 for the murder of Jonathan Camilien, 26, whose dismembered remains were found April 9 in and near a duffel bag in Cambridge. Colina had already been charged with assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body, and his bail was revoked in a separate, unrelated assault case. Police traced surveillance footage from the dump site to a nearby apartment building, where additional body parts were found; the two men were acquainted."
11354,"On a rainy Tuesday in Washington, D.C., CNN’s Brian Todd and Khalil Abdallah saw a mother duck and her ducklings trying to cross busy L Street NW. Restaurant patrons and other pedestrians halted traffic, used a donated umbrella to guide the agitated mother, retrieved a stray duckling, and escorted the brood to a safer grassy spot at 16th and L. Todd called the downtown duck rescue extraordinary, and both CNN and The Washington Post reported on it."
11365,"• Since Saudi-led airstrikes began on March 26, more than 500 Houthi rebels have been killed and about 1,200 raids have been conducted, according to Saudi officials.  
• A border clash in Najran saw Houthis shell a Saudi site, killing three Saudi officers and wounding two.  
• Reported civilian impact: Yemen’s Health Ministry lists 385 dead and 342 wounded; WHO’s broader count (including militants) is 648 dead and 2,191 wounded.  
• The coalition’s stated aim is to stop Houthi advances toward southern Yemen.  
• Yemen has spiraled into crisis since Houthis ousted President Hadi in January, and the UN says most of the country’s 25 million people already need humanitarian aid."
11396,"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, head of the Diocese of Kansas City–St. Joseph, three years after Finn became the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in the church’s sex-abuse scandal. In 2012 a judge found Finn guilty of one misdemeanor count of failing to report suspected child abuse after church staff discovered child-pornography images on priest Shawn Ratigan’s computer but waited nearly five months to alert police; Finn received two years’ probation, while Ratigan later pleaded guilty to five child-porn charges. The sentence also required a $10,000 counseling fund and mandatory abuse-reporting training for diocesan staff. Finn retained his post until now, drawing criticism from Cardinal Sean O’Malley, scholars, and watchdogs who say the Vatican acted too slowly and too quietly. Archbishop Joseph Naumann has been named apostolic administrator of the diocese until a permanent bishop is chosen. Advocates urge Pope Francis to make bishop accountability explicit."
11416,"Tristan da Cunha— a UK overseas territory and, with about 270 residents, the world’s most remote inhabited archipelago— is launching an international design competition, run with the Royal Institute of British Architects, to secure its long-term viability ahead of its 200th anniversary in 2016. Architects experienced in renewable energy, modern housing and low-cost agriculture are invited to propose ways to upgrade the settlement’s 40-year-old, poorly insulated concrete-and-rock buildings, cut fossil-fuel dependence, and enhance limited infrastructure for power, water, waste and internet. Designs must allow for severe logistical limits: the island’s only port at Edinburgh of the Seven Seas is usable roughly 60 days a year, cargo space is restricted, and Cape Town—1,750 miles away—is the nearest mainland link.

The competition timeline: initial ideas due mid-June 2015; 20 entries then five will be shortlisted between June and September; the winner is to be named in June 2016, with funding to be sought from UK and EU grants.

Tristan’s economy now relies on lobster fishing, sales of stamps, coins and handicrafts, and modest tourism; residents already produce much of their own food but face rising living costs. The project seeks “cost-effective and practical solutions” to improve energy efficiency and modernize government facilities, ensuring the community’s future sustainability."
11428,"• Inside Politics highlighted four emerging political stories.  

1. President Obama will attend a Panama summit where a first-in-decades face-to-face with Cuba’s Raúl Castro is possible. The White House must decide whether such a meeting would advance its tougher-than-expected Cuba thaw or reward the Castro government too soon.  

2. Hillary Clinton has rented Brooklyn headquarters and will soon declare her presidential bid. Her rollout will “re-introduce” her through biographical themes—childhood, early children’s-advocacy work, Arkansas years—and showcase an even larger-than-expected, veteran staff while staging smaller, more personal events.  

3. Sen. Robert Menendez’s corruption indictment includes an allegation that his staff solicited super-PAC donations, a potential campaign-finance violation. Watchdogs say a deeper Federal Election Commission probe could implicate additional lawmakers.  

4. By next Monday the GOP field will officially include Ted Cruz, Rand Paul (announcing Tuesday), and Marco Rubio. As candidacies formalize, Republican strategists are being pressed to take sides: in New Hampshire Mitt Romney veteran Matt Maroney joined Chris Christie; pollster Tony Fabrizio chose Rand Paul after being courted by Christie and Scott Walker; calls are also coming from John Kasich and Donald Trump."
11430,"CNN has promoted Jake Tapper to anchor its Sunday morning political interview show “State of the Union” beginning in June. He will keep his roles as chief Washington correspondent and weekday host of “The Lead.” Tapper, who joined CNN from ABC in 2013 and previously earned praise while filling in on ABC’s “This Week,” succeeds Candy Crowley, whose December departure led to months of rotating hosts. Announcing the move, CNN Worldwide CEO Jeff Zucker cited Tapper’s reporting, storytelling and interviewing skills; Tapper expressed enthusiasm about guiding the program during election season. The appointment comes amid wider Sunday-show turnover (CBS’s Bob Schieffer leaving, NBC’s Chuck Todd replacing David Gregory) and makes Tapper one of the few anchors handling both weekday and Sunday duties, a pattern previously set at CNN by Wolf Blitzer."
11773,"Oscar-winning rapper-actor Common has signed on for Warner Bros.’ DC villain film “Suicide Squad,” directed by David Ayer and now filming in Toronto. The ensemble already includes Jared Leto (Joker), Will Smith (Deadshot), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), Joel Kinnaman, Cara Delevingne, Viola Davis, Adam Beach, Ike Barinholtz, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Scott Eastwood, with rumored cameos by Jesse Eisenberg (Lex Luthor) and Ben Affleck (Batman). Based on a “Dirty Dozen”-style premise, the story follows imprisoned super-villains forced into covert missions for the government. Common’s specific role has not been disclosed."
11800,"American development expert Warren Weinstein, 73, kidnapped by al-Qaeda gunmen at his Lahore, Pakistan, home in 2011, was inadvertently killed—along with Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto—during a January U.S. drone strike on an al-Qaeda compound near the Afghan-Pakistani border, U.S. officials revealed Thursday. Weinstein, a former Peace Corps volunteer and USAID contractor for consulting firm J.E. Austin Associates, had been shown gaunt in a 2013 hostage video and suffered from heart disease and asthma. His wife Elaine, who said the family spent 3½ years urgently seeking his freedom, criticized both U.S. and Pakistani authorities for inconsistent efforts but welcomed the promised independent U.S. review; she ultimately blamed the captors for his death. President Obama lauded Weinstein’s lifelong service to impoverished communities and lamented the tragedy, noting officials had not known hostages were present at the targeted site."
11803,"South Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo has offered to resign amid a corruption scandal sparked by the April 9 suicide of businessman Sung Woan-jong, who left a note naming officials—including Lee—as recipients of illicit cash. Lee, denying wrongdoing, will remain in office until President Park Geun-hye decides on his resignation; the deputy prime minister is temporarily chairing Cabinet meetings. Park, currently on a trip to Latin America and due back April 27, called Lee’s decision “regrettable” but said she will not tolerate corruption. Lee and seven other Park-linked politicians are under investigation by a special prosecutor’s team."
11871,"• Corinthian Colleges Inc. has announced the closure of its last 28 campuses, capping a long fight to rein in abuse in the for-profit college sector.  
• Once enrolling 70,000 students, Corinthian epitomized “predator colleges”: institutions that charge about 60 % more than public schools, rely on federal loans for 86 % of revenue, use aggressive recruiting, provide questionable degrees, and leave many graduates jobless and deeply in debt.  
• For-profits educate 13 % of U.S. college students yet cause nearly half of all student-loan defaults; average online-program graduates earn less than high-school dropouts.  
• The sector’s tactics have drawn GAO findings of widespread misconduct, investigations by 36 state attorneys general, and settlements such as Career Education Corp.’s $10 million payout.  
• A debt strike by hundreds of Corinthian alumni prompted Education Secretary Arne Duncan to consider loan forgiveness.  
• Advocates now urge shutting the rest of the for-profit schools and canceling debts for students who gain neither jobs nor transfers within three years."
11884,"Kabul has ballooned in population but emptied of the foreign presence and commerce that once defined it during NATO’s mission.  
• Five English-speaking former NATO employees, now fired and blacklisted for unclear reasons, live homeless and fear reprisals; they exemplify the war’s uneasy legacy.  
• U.S. Embassy and NATO declined comment.  
• Expat neighborhoods, restaurants and Chicken Street are largely deserted; “poppy palace” villas sit empty.  
• Idle rows of U.S. heavy machinery and supply trucks show how support systems for 120,000 troops have collapsed; truck drivers are stuck with devalued vehicles while wealthy contractors have left the country.  
• Despite uncertainty, brightly lit wedding halls keep multiplying, and city lights—maintained at huge cost during the war—still shine, though residents wonder how long they will last as the remaining American forces withdraw into the embassy by the end of next year."
11885,"Consumer Reports analyzed 70 million domestic passenger trips on the five largest U.S. airlines and ranked them by how often they supplied award seats.  
• Southwest led with 11.9 million award tickets—11.5 % of its 103.1 million seats—helped by policies such as “Every Seat is an Award Seat,” no blackout dates, non-expiring points, and no extra fees.  
• Delta placed second (5.6 million awards), United third (5 million), American fourth (3.5 million), and JetBlue last with 892,000 award seats—4.5 % of its 19.7 million seats; JetBlue cites infrequent fliers and recently dropped mileage-expiration rules.  

Overall, about 10 % of passengers on these carriers traveled on award tickets, but value varies: e.g., spending 12,500–30,000 miles for the low-fare Los Angeles–San Francisco route is poor value compared with pricier routes such as New York–San Francisco or Chicago–Los Angeles.  

Satisfaction scores ranked Southwest 86, JetBlue 85, Delta 70, American 66, United 63. Southwest charges no ancillary fees; the others levy fees for bags, booking changes, etc. Consumers are reminded that “free” tickets aren’t free—the cost of miles is built into purchases, and airlines profit when miles go unused."
11890,"In July 2012, James Holmes opened fire during a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” in Aurora, Colorado, killing 12 and wounding 70, after entering the theater in body armor with multiple guns and a gas mask. Now 27, the former University of Colorado neuroscience Ph.D. student admits the shootings but pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming a psychotic episode; prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty. Jury selection in early 2015 summoned 9,000 people and produced a panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates (19 women, five men); opening statements are set for Monday, and the trial could run into autumn as jurors decide on 165 counts.  

Holmes, once an honors student from a middle-class California family, had shown deteriorating mental health: telling a classmate in March 2012 he wanted to kill, being reported as a potential danger by psychiatrist Lynne Fenton in June, and purchasing four weapons and 6,000 rounds of ammunition while dropping out of school. His parents ask that his life be spared and that he be confined to a mental-health institution; victims’ families urge media to avoid glorifying mass killers."
11891,"Prosperity-gospel pastor Creflo Dollar defended his effort to buy a $65 million Gulfstream G650 jet after widespread criticism. Speaking at World Changers Church International, he said the “devil” was trying to discredit him and insisted he had never asked his congregants “for a dime,” although a March video had sought $300 donations from 200,000 global “friends” to replace his aging 1984 Gulfstream G-1159A, which suffered two accidents. The fundraising video has been removed, but donations can still be made on the church’s site. Dollar argued a jet is necessary to serve the church’s claimed 3 million supporters worldwide. The G650 seats 18 passengers, has two Rolls-Royce engines and high-speed Internet. Prosperity gospel teaches that tithing 10 percent leads to wealth and health. Attempts to reach Dollar’s ministry for comment were unsuccessful."
