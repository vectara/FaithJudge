14-0,"Four gunmen attacked Kabul’s 400-bed Sardar Daud military hospital at 09:00 local time by detonating explosives at the gate and then firing on staff and patients with guns and grenades. Afghan special-forces commandos landed on the roof and killed all four assailants after more than six hours of fighting; over 50 people were wounded. The so-called Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility while the Taliban denied involvement. President Ashraf Ghani and de-facto deputy Abdullah Abdullah condemned the assault, calling it an affront to basic human values. Analysts note this is IS’s first direct armed clash with security forces in Kabul—using a gate-breach tactic typical of the Taliban—signaling increased resources and the potential for more such operations after earlier IS attacks on civilian targets and previous bombings that killed dozens in the capital."

14-2,"Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, due to step down in 2018 or potentially stay until 2021, announced a compromise: he will extend his term by only one extra year. He says the choice is driven purely by personal factors—chiefly his family’s wish to return to Canada after two of his daughters finish major exams in 2018—rather than political pressure or criticism of the Bank’s pre-referendum Brexit forecasts. Professionally, the extra year prevents him from quitting during the core Brexit negotiations, giving markets some continuity until the Article 50 process should be finished, after which a new governor can take over. Downing Street accepted that the decision was entirely his."
14-3,"Adrian “A.A.” Gill, renowned Sunday Times columnist, has died from what he called the “full English” of cancers. Announcing the death, editor Martin Ivens praised him as the paper’s “heart and soul” and “a giant among journalists”; Gill’s final column on his illness appears in tomorrow’s edition.  

Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill overcame dyslexia, studied art, and began writing in the 1980s before joining the Sunday Times in 1993, dictating his copy by phone. Celebrated for dazzling, fearless prose, he was also notorious for provocative pieces—among them shooting a baboon in Tanzania, insulting the Welsh, and calling Clare Balding “a dyke on a bike,” actions that drew repeated criticism.  

Tributes flowed from colleagues including Jay Rayner, Tim Shipman, Stig Abell, John Witherow, Andrew Neil, and Piers Morgan, who hailed both his talent and his generosity.  

Gill’s personal life included marriages to author Cressida Connolly (1983) and future Home Secretary Amber Rudd (1991), with whom he had two children, Flora and Alistair. Illness prompted his recent engagement to long-term partner Nicola Formby, mother of their twins Edith and Isaac."
14-4,"The passage profiles three activist hacking collectives active around the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

1. Ukrainian Cyber Troops  
   • Led by Kiev programmer Yevhen Dokukin.  
   • Operations: hacked two Russian interior-ministry servers and a Rostov-region police e-mail; gave 35 GB of data to volunteers who say it shows wounded Russian soldiers evacuated from Ukraine.  
   • Tactics: heavy use of DDoS (“their artillery”) to knock rebel sites offline; freeze separatist PayPal/WebMoney accounts; tap rebel-area CCTV for troop movements; commandeer printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian slogans insulting Vladimir Putin.  
   • Media reports link their intelligence to Ukrainian artillery, but officials deny using unverified hacker data.

2. Cyber Berkut (pro-Russian, anti-Western)  
   • Name echoes Yanukovych-era riot police; says it seeks to block Kyiv’s “genocide.”  
   • Actions: during U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden’s November visit, defaced Ukrainian government sites with “Joseph Biden is the fascists’ master” and claim to have stolen U.S. aid documents from a staffer’s device.  
   • Other exploits: hacked Kiev billboards to air a “war criminals” video; says it disrupted October parliamentary vote-counting, leaked defence-ministry data on losses/desertions, blocked President Poroshenko’s site, and published an unverified Facebook chat implying Ukraine downed MH17.

3. Anonymous International (Russian, aka b0ltai/Shaltay Boltay)  
   • Publishes leaked Kremlin materials; source unclear (hacks vs. insiders).  
   • Ukraine-related leaks: a November letter from a Russian fighter stating locals do not back separatists, and May emails to/from former FSB colonel Igor Girkin (Strelkov), then a key rebel commander.  
   • Its website is now blocked in Russia.

Collectively, these groups expose documents, disable websites, hijack devices (CCTV, billboards, printers) and wage information warfare, while claiming independence from state security agencies."

15-3,"A nationwide study of 3.7 million adults (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2005-2012) shows U.S. heavy drinking rose 17.2%, driven mainly by women. Heavy drinking (avg. >1 drink/day for women, >2 for men past month) affected 8% of adults in 2012; binge drinking (≥4 drinks for women, ≥5 for men on one occasion) affected 18%. Women’s binge-drinking rates grew more than seven times those of men; in Santa Clara County, female binge drinking climbed 36% versus 23% for males. County variation was wide: 6% binge rate in Madison County, ID, versus 36% in Menominee, WI; 2% heavy-drinker rate in Hancock County, TN, versus 22% in Esmeralda County, NV. Despite heavier use, overall prevalence of “any drinking” stayed stable. Researchers cite shifting social norms for women, youthful and affluent demographics, cheaper real-price alcohol, increased advertising, and looser alcohol-control policies as likely contributors. Alcohol harms remain high—about 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010 and annual costs exceeding $220 billion."

16-0,"The article contrasts the looming Mayweather-Pacquiao bout—touted as boxing’s richest and most significant of the century—with past landmark contests, focusing on Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Durán.

• Context  
  – Great fights are judged by action, cultural impact, expectations and finances.  
  – This piece is the sixth in a series on 12 history-shaping bouts.

• Leonard–Durán trilogy  
  1) June 1980, Montreal: Durán narrowly won Leonard’s welterweight title amid scoring confusion (a draw was corrected to a unanimous 148-147 verdict termed “a monument to indecision”).  
  2) Nov 25 1980, Louisiana Superdome: Leonard abandoned a toe-to-toe style, used speed and movement, taunted Durán, and in round 8 Durán turned away saying “No más,” stunning the sport.  
        – Durán blamed stomach cramps; his manager said he quit from embarrassment.  
        – Panama withdrew his commercials and public anger ensued.  
  3) 1989: Leonard won their final meeting by wide decision, keeping the super-middleweight crown.

• Aftermath  
  – Durán needed three years to regain stature, doing so on June 16 1983 by knocking out Davey Moore for the light-middleweight title.  
  – Leonard regards forcing Durán to quit as a greater feat than a knockout.

The Leonard–Durán saga, launching the “golden age” of the middle weights alongside Hearns and Hagler, exemplifies how a fight’s meaning can transcend the ring—paralleling the expectations now surrounding Mayweather vs. Pacquiao."
16-1,"World No. 1 Rory McIlroy, 25, says it is “unthinkable” that he will retire without winning the Masters and completing the career grand slam. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland, he calls his 2011 Augusta collapse—when a closing 80 cost him a four-shot lead—the most important day of his career because it taught him crucial lessons he later used to win the 2011 U.S. Open, 2012 PGA, and both the Open and PGA in 2014. Although he has just one top-10 in six Masters starts, McIlroy believes Augusta suits him and hopes to win not only once but multiple times. He intends to block out the pre-tournament hype, using the course as a “sanctuary,” just as he did during last season’s successes amid personal turmoil that included ending his engagement to Caroline Wozniacki and a costly legal dispute with his former management company."

16-4,"A three-bedroom, 1,990 sq ft maisonette in Egerton Place, Knightsbridge, is on sale for £575,000—far below local prices—because its lease has only three years left. At that price the cost equates to about £191,000 a year (£15,000 a month), similar to renting. The flat is unmodernised but includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift access, parking and a communal garden. A second, larger (2,500 sq ft) unmodernised maisonette on the same street is listed for £595,000 under the same three-year lease condition.

Estate agent Russell Simpson says modernised homes here achieve £2,750–£3,000 per sq ft, implying values of roughly £6 million for the smaller unit and £7.5 million for the larger if the lease is extended. Extending to a 90-year lease is expected to cost £3.35–£4.5 million; the freeholder is thought to be the Wellcome Trust. Interest has been strong, though consultant Alex Newall cautions that the low asking price masks the “massive premium” needed to lengthen the lease.

11-1,"At Augusta National’s Par-3 Contest, 75-year-old Jack Nicklaus thrilled spectators by recording his first ever hole-in-one at the course, spinning his tee shot on the 130-yard fourth back into the cup while playing with Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw. His ace was one of five on the day, matching the 2002 record; Camilo Villegas made two (holes 4 and 8) yet lost the contest to Kevin Streelman in a play-off. Nicklaus, who first donned the green jacket as the youngest champion in 1963 and captured his sixth in 1986, remains one of only five men to complete the career Grand Slam, a feat Rory McIlroy can match with another major victory."
11-3,"A 5.68 m juvenile female Omura’s whale, a species once feared extinct and first scientifically described only in 2003, washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after cyclone Olwyn. This is the first record of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff confirmed the identification with DNA profiling. The discovery is considered highly significant because little is known about the whale, which is normally found in Indonesian, Philippine and Sea of Japan waters. Omura’s whales have a sleek body and distinctive skeletal traits, including numerous vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried so the skeleton can be retrieved later for further research and possible museum display."
11-4,"A 5.68-metre juvenile female Omura’s whale, a species once feared extinct, washed up on a remote beach near Exmouth on Western Australia’s North West Cape after Cyclone Olwyn. It is the first record of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. Department of Parks and Wildlife staff confirmed the identification through DNA analysis after initial confusion. Environment Minister Albert Jacob called the discovery highly significant because Omura’s whales, first described scientifically in 2003, are poorly understood and normally occur in tropical and subtropical waters around Indonesia, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. The whale’s sleek body and distinctive skeletal features (including four digits on each pectoral fin and 53–63 vertebrae) will be studied further: the carcass has been buried so the skeleton can be retrieved in a few years for research and possible museum display, aiding future field identification and knowledge of the species’ distribution."

10-0,"• Russia opened the Su-24 “black box” in Moscow; investigators say some flight data is missing and findings will be published next week.  
• The data are meant to clarify whether the jet was in Turkish or Syrian airspace when it was downed on 24 November by Turkish F-16s.  
• Turkey claims the plane ignored warnings and violated its airspace; Russia insists it was shot down over Syria.  
• The incident has severely strained relations: President Putin denounced Turkey’s government, and Moscow demands an apology.  
• Russia has imposed sanctions, notably banning package holidays to Turkey, a measure expected to cost Ankara billions.  
• Of the two-man crew, the pilot was killed (reportedly by ground militants) and the navigator rescued; a Russian marine was also killed during rescue efforts and a helicopter destroyed.  
• Both countries operate in Syria but back opposing sides despite a shared stance against IS."
10-2,"An oil-leak explosion Monday night at a paraxylene-producing plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian, sparked a large fire. Six people were injured—five by broken glass—and taken to hospital. Over 600 firefighters brought the blaze under control; no toxic chemical spill has been reported. Residents nearby felt the blast and shared images online. The same plant exploded in July 2013, and its construction, originally planned for densely populated Xiamen, was relocated after 2007 protests amid wider nationwide opposition to PX facilities."
10-3,"In autumn 2004 a 15-year-old girl was raped in a Portsmouth garage by David Ayrton. Ayrton, now 34, has since transitioned name-wise to Davina but says no physical or medical changes have been made and denies the offence. A Portsmouth Crown Court jury found her guilty; sentencing is set for 4 March. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her to custody—likely a male prison in Winchester—citing risks of self-harm and non-attendance. Ayrton has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, so special protocols are planned for her detention. The victim testified she resisted during the attack while two others slept and that her recollection was clear. Ayrton disclosed the assault to a care-home worker in 2014."
10-4,"The IAAF Council has awarded Eugene, USA the 2021 World Championships, bypassing the normal bid process because it views the event as a unique strategic chance to stage the championships in the United States for the first time. Eugene had unsuccessfully sought the 2019 edition, which went to Doha. IAAF president Lamine Diack said the choice reflected broad support from U.S. stakeholders and a key market opportunity; a similar direct award occurred for Osaka 2007."
13-0,"Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson, seriously injured by a 2006 Afghanistan bomb attack, carried the Olympic torch in Doncaster on 26 June. Supported as he walked for nearly 30 minutes, he impressed crowds: though a brain injury once removed his speech, he now speaks unaided, trains 12 hours daily in rehab, uses crutches, and raises funds as patron of military charity Pilgrim Bandits. After his torch appearance he received far more than Facebook’s 5,000-friend limit, prompting advice that he switch to a public page or use the subscribe feature. His mother Diane called the surge of online messages, mail and visit requests “phenomenal,” saying the support has greatly lifted his spirits. Parkinson is one of 8,000 torchbearers on the 70-day, 8,000-mile relay leading to the London Olympics opening on 27 July."
13-1,"The forthcoming Poldark episode skips abruptly from Demelza’s recent pregnancy announcement to her being eight-months pregnant and, minutes later, giving birth to a baby daughter whom Ross Poldark adores. Viewers have mocked the show’s compressed timeline—similar to Elizabeth’s earlier instant pregnancy—joking on Twitter that pregnancies in Poldark last only ten minutes. Despite having wed Demelza out of duty, Ross affirms his love for her, dashing hopes of admiring fans."
13-2,"• Official data show 272 children with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were hospitalised in England in the past year.  
• Experts say the real figure is likely much higher; WHO estimates suggest at least 1 % of UK babies—about 7,500 annually—may suffer learning, behavioural, or physical impairments from prenatal alcohol exposure.  
• FAS damage is permanent and widely under-diagnosed; associated problems include limb deformities, organ defects, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy.  
• Case example: 15-year-old Niamh Brown, born with FAS, needs daily assistance; her adoptive parents founded the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust in 2007.  
• Current government advice is no more than two alcohol units twice weekly during pregnancy, but campaigners argue that guidance should call for complete abstinence."
13-3,"• Scotland’s women have won all five Euro 2017 qualifiers and face fellow-unbeaten Iceland at Falkirk on Friday; a win would virtually clinch direct qualification and avoid another play-off heartache.  
• Iceland, ranked one place above Scotland (20th), are group top seeds; the two head-to-head games (Friday and 20 September in Reykjavik) are expected to decide first place, though six of eight runners-up also qualify automatically and Scotland currently lead that race.  
• Striker Lisa Evans (24) says missing out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and the 2015 World Cup would be “devastating” but stresses the squad is taking it “step by step.”  
• Evans is among 12 of the 20-player squad based outside Scotland—five in England, four in Sweden and two in the USA; she just won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich and believes experience abroad is raising Scotland’s level.  
• She urges a big home crowd, noting fan support can make “a huge difference.”"
13-4,"A light twin-engine Aerostar was filmed at Aero Acres airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida, landing without its landing gear. The aircraft scraped along the runway, its propellers striking the surface, before the pilot applied full power and took off again despite visible damage. Pilot Chris Georgaklis, 85, then flew about 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and landed safely with his dog aboard. Witnesses described the loud propeller impacts and were surprised the engines kept running. The FAA is investigating; gear-up (belly) landings are usually due to pilot oversight or mechanical failure."

12-0,"A 5.68-metre juvenile female Omura’s whale, a species once feared extinct and first scientifically described only in 2003, washed up on a remote Exmouth beach on Western Australia’s North West Cape after cyclone Olwyn. It is the first recorded sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. DNA profiling was required to confirm the identification, giving scientists a rare chance to study the little-known tropical/subtropical whale, normally found around Indonesia, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan. The carcass has been buried so the skeleton—distinguished by its sleek body and unique vertebral and pectoral-fin features—can be recovered later for research and possible museum display."
12-1,"Conor McGregor, preparing for his July 11 featherweight title fight against champion José Aldo in Las Vegas, has shown off a new tiger-face tattoo on his stomach (adding to the gorilla-eating-a-heart on his chest). Posting the image on Instagram, he wrote, “If you see the tiger, it’s too late. You’re food.” McGregor says Aldo lacks the desire to keep the belt, pointing to an incident on their March Dublin promo tour when he snatched the title belt before 5,000 fans. Their rivalry remains tense as the bout approaches."
12-3,"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck at 15:48 local time (14:48 GMT) at a depth of about 15.5 km, with its epicentre in Garfagnana, 35 km north of Lucca. Felt from Milan, Florence, Bologna and Modena, the tremor caused phone and power outages in Garfagnana, prompted school evacuations, and sent residents into the streets, but no injuries or damage were immediately reported; several weaker aftershocks followed. INGV seismologist Alessandro Amato called it a “medium-strong,” “fairly shallow” quake that “came out of nowhere.” The event recalls Italy’s seismic vulnerability: two quakes in the same area last May killed more than 20 people, and the 2009 L’Aquila disaster claimed nearly 300 lives, after which six scientists and an ex-official were later convicted of manslaughter for downplaying the risk."
12-4,"Bobbi Kristina Brown, 22-year-old daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, is off sedation but remains unresponsive and has “global and irreversible brain damage,” according to her grandmother Cissy Houston and a medical source.  Although Bobby Brown recently said his daughter was “awake,” the family’s attorney clarifies that while doctors expect her to live a long time, she faces a lengthy, uncertain rehabilitation; she does not react to voices, her eyes don’t track movement, and she has a tracheostomy.  Relatives say they are relying on faith as they await any change in her condition."
