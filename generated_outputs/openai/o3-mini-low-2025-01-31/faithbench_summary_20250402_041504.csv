14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades attacked the Sardar Daud hospital after an explosive was detonated at its gate, opening fire on staff and patients. Commandos who landed on the hospital roof engaged in several hours of fighting and eventually killed all four attackers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, while the Taliban denied any involvement. Over 50 people were wounded in the attack, which began at 09:00 local time. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the assault, highlighting that attacking a hospital—a place immune by religious standards—was an attack on all of Afghanistan. The incident, featuring an attacker in a white coat seen firing indiscriminately, marks a shift in IS tactics in Afghanistan toward direct engagement with security forces in the capital."
14-1,"The passage details the 46th Booker Prize shortlist and betting odds ahead of the announcement at London's Guildhall on Tuesday night. For the first time ever, the prize is open to all authors writing in English regardless of nationality. Mukherjee’s The Lives of Others—a novel set in 1967 Calcutta focusing on family secrets and political activism—is the bookmakers’ favourite at 5/2, while Howard Jacobson’s J, a futuristic love story, is also a strong contender despite criticism that awarding him might repeat recent double wins. Other shortlisted titles include Ali Smith’s How To Be Both, Joshua Ferris’s To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, Karen Joy Fowler’s best-selling We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, and Richard Flanagan’s The Narrow Road to the Deep North.

14-2,"Governor Mark Carney of the Bank of England surprised many by choosing a third option for his tenure. Instead of staying until 2021 or leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he decided to extend his term by only one year. Although this extension might seem politically awkward given the ongoing Brexit negotiations, Carney explained that his decision was entirely personal. With significant family milestones—such as his daughters completing key school exams—happen to fall in 2018, he opted for the shorter extension. He made clear that no external pressures, whether from government or past economic forecasts, influenced his decision."
14-3,"Adrian Gill, a celebrated and often controversial journalist for the Sunday Times, died on the morning his final column was to appear. Known for his fearless wit and distinctive style, Gill openly discussed his battle with multiple cancers, referring to them as the ""full English."" Despite his illness and the controversies his remarks often sparked, colleagues and former editors described him as a brilliant writer and a giant in journalism. Born in Edinburgh in 1954 and having overcome dyslexia, he began his career with art reviews before moving on to major publications. Gill was married twice—first to Cressida Connolly, then to Amber Rudd—and was engaged to his long-term partner, Nicola Formby, with whom he had twin children."
14-4,"The passage details cyber warfare actions in the Ukraine conflict carried out by several hacker groups. The Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Yevhen Dokukin, claim responsibility for various attacks such as hacking Russian interior ministry servers, disrupting rebel websites with DDoS attacks, hijacking public CCTV systems, and even commandeering network printers to broadcast pro-Ukrainian messages. Dokukin shared his gathered data—allegedly including evidence that wounded Russian servicemen were evacuated—with the Ukrainian security service, though he criticizes their lack of analysis. On the other side, the pro-Russian group Cyber Berkut, known for its anti-Western stance and messaging referencing figures like US Vice-President Joe Biden, has targeted Ukrainian government websites, leaked confidential documents, manipulated electronic billboards, and allegedly interfered with vote-counting systems. Additionally, the group Anonymous International, also called b0ltai, publicizes leaked Kremlin documents and covers both Russian and Ukrainian domestic matters."

15-3,"A University of Washington study found that heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2 percent from 2005 to 2012, with the rise driven primarily by women’s binge drinking. The study, which is the first to track drinking patterns at the county level, reported that in 2012, 8 percent of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers, with significant regional variations. Factors contributing to the increase include changing social norms that make heavy drinking more acceptable for women, greater disposable income among young professionals, lower real prices for alcohol due to stagnant tax rates, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies."
4-0,"The game got off to an exciting start when the Giants scored a short-handed goal through player-coach Derrick Walser, although Jeff Dimmen quickly brought the Panthers level. In the second period, Mike Forney put one team ahead with a powerplay breakaway effort, but Andy Bohmback then equalised. The scoring continued with Mike Radja finding the net from an acute angle and James Desmarais extending the lead to 4–2 before Nottingham’s David Ling pulled one back.

First, a 21‐year‐old Scotland Under-21 international, Smith, who made his Aberdeen debut in 2012 and has scored four goals in 89 appearances for the Pittodrie side, has been on loan since July and has already netted five goals this season for United. Second, St Mirren’s manager Jack Ross praised the signing of a player known as Cammy—highlighting his quality, maturity, and potential as an additional attacking option—while noting that he hadn’t expected to secure him given his previous link with Dundee United. The summary concludes by mentioning that St Mirren, currently at the bottom of the Championship, will host Falkirk on Saturday."
4-4,"The passage highlights three topics: Billy Ray Cyrus, who significantly popularized country music worldwide; the debut album ""Excuse My French"" by rapper French Montana; and an Egyptian comedy film titled ""Excuse My French"" (2014) directed by Amr Salama, which is based on his experiences in an Egyptian middle school and underwent script revisions due to censorship concerns over its portrayal of religious discrimination."

Nicholson also praised the players, noting that the 27‐year‐old (referred to as “Myles”) shows leadership qualities despite limited appearances, while the younger player (referred to as “Ruairi”) is described as raw but eager. The club, known as the Gulls, sits four points above the relegation zone after winning just one of their last six games."
9-0,"The passage distinguishes between two historical figures named Francis I. One (Franz Stefan/François Étienne, 1708–1765) was Holy Roman Emperor and Grand Duke of Tuscany, although his wife held the real power. The other (François Ier, 1494–1547) was the first King of France from the Angoulême branch of the House of Valois, reigning from 1515 until his death. Known by nicknames such as “François au Grand Nez,” “the Grand Colas,” and “Roi-Chevalier” for his personal martial involvement, he waged wars against his rival, Charles V—the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor—and, after unsuccessful campaigns, controversially formed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with Suleiman the Magnificent. The Italian War of 1536–1538 was a notable conflict in his rivalry with Charles V."

Dracone, who was in the pit for tires and fuel on lap 25, spun while exiting his pit box and clipped Phillips' leg. Phillips was treated at the infield care center, received stitches, and was later released.

9-2,"Widnes established a strong lead in the first half with tries from Macgraff Leuluai, Ah Van, and Chris Bridge, while Castleford’s loanee Paddy Flynn scored for his parent club. Early in the second half, Flynn added another try for Castleford, but further tries from Ah Van, Lloyd White (who scored twice), and Joe Mellor extended Widnes’ lead to 38–12. Although Castleford then mounted a rapid comeback with three tries in four minutes from Larne Patrick, Luke Gale, and another from Flynn (his hat-trick goal), Widnes managed to hold on for the win.

Last season at Dundee, he scored nine goals and has mostly appeared as a substitute this term.

With nearly 400 senior club appearances, two Scotland caps (with one international goal in 2008), and previous spells at Bristol City, Brentford, and Bristol Rovers, he is eager to contribute as St Mirren, currently eighth in the Championship and seven points clear of Alloa, aim to build momentum with a series of wins."

16-0,"The passage highlights the anticipation of the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao bout—promoted as the most financially significant and potentially one of the most important fights in boxing history—while emphasizing that its ultimate legacy depends on the outcome of that night. It then shifts focus to the historic rivalry between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran. The text recounts the controversial first fight between Leonard and Duran, marked by confusing scoring and contentious decisions, and details their rematch where Leonard’s speed and strategy led to Duran’s dramatic “no mas” moment. This moment, which shocked the boxing world and temporarily tarnished Duran’s reputation in Panama, is portrayed as a pivotal and defining episode in a series of legendary fights that shaped the sport’s history."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy is determined to win the Masters, believing it is unthinkable not to add a green jacket to his career achievements. At 25, he is focused on completing the career grand slam, joining a select group of players who have won all four majors. McIlroy recounted that his 2011 final-round collapse at Augusta National was the most important day of his career, teaching him valuable lessons that helped him achieve subsequent major victories. Despite having only one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, he is confident in his ability to perform well at Augusta, viewing the course as a sanctuary from off-course distractions such as his cancelled wedding and legal disputes. His goal remains to win at least one green jacket, emphasizing that not achieving this milestone would be deeply disappointing."
16-2,"Pablo Mandado and Ilze Zebolde, a Spanish–Latvian couple in their late twenties and early thirties, left their restaurant jobs in Manchester to pursue a spontaneous dream: to explore the world by bicycle. Over the past 356 days, they’ve covered almost 7,000 miles through 16 countries—all while spending less than three euros per day by relying on free accommodations (camping, Couchsurfing, Warmshowers) and a minimalist lifestyle where food is their main expense. Having cycled through parts of Europe including a symbolic ride from Greece into Turkey, they plan to continue riding into Asia and eventually cycle across the American continent as part of their open-ended odyssey."
16-3,"Pablo (27) from Spain and Ilze (31) from Latvia quit their restaurant jobs in Manchester and set off on an open-ended, low-budget cycling adventure to explore the world at a leisurely pace. Over the course of 356 days, they have pedaled nearly 7,000 miles through 16 countries, spending less than three euros per day—most of which goes to food. They keep costs low by camping (and occasionally staying with hosts through websites like Couchsurfing and Warmshowers) and relying entirely on their bicycles for transport. Starting in London and riding through various parts of Europe—including France, Spain, Italy, and Turkey—they see each stop as an opportunity to simply enjoy the journey, with future plans to head into Asia and eventually cycle along the entire American continent."
16-4,"A three-bedroom, 1,990‑sq‑ft unmodernised maisonette in Knightsbridge’s Egerton Place is on sale for £575,000, though it has only three years remaining on its lease. The property, which includes two bathrooms, a reception room, a utility room, a lift, parking, and a communal garden, requires renovation. Although the low sale price is attractive, the short lease means the effective cost is about £191,000 per year—or roughly £15,000 per month—similar to local rental rates. However, if a buyer negotiates a lease extension—which could cost between £3.35 million and £4.5 million for a 90‑year lease—the property could be worth over £6 million. Interest has been high, with developers and end users considering the unusual opportunity despite the catch."
6-0,"Storey won her event in Nottwil, Switzerland, finishing over two minutes ahead of Poland’s Anna Harkowska and is now aiming for a 17th title in the upcoming road race. The 37-year-old, Britain’s most decorated female Paralympian with 22 Paralympic medals across cycling and swimming, called her victory a massive relief as she prepares for further Paralympic challenges at next year’s Rio Games. Previously, she earned six medals in swimming at the 1992 Games before switching to cycling in 2005, and she has amassed 21 world titles, including four golds at the 2012 London Paralympics."
6-1,"The passage provides information on two British boxers from the Eubank family. Chris Eubank (born 8 August 1966) is a retired professional boxer whose career spanned from 1985 to 1998.

6-2,"The passage profiles two individuals named James Jones. The author James Jones won the 1952 National Book Award for his debut novel, From Here to Eternity, which was later adapted into a film and a television series.

6-3,"Paul Sheerin, 39, a former Aberdeen (Dons) midfielder who has served as player-manager of Arbroath (nicknamed the Red Lichties) since 2010, has been appointed to replace Neil Cooper at Aberdeen (Pittodrie). Despite Arbroath chairman John Christison’s wish to retain him, Sheerin chose to return to Aberdeen—a decision confirmed by Aberdeen’s CEO Duncan Fraser after a comprehensive selection process. Notably, Sheerin led Arbroath to their first national trophy by winning the Scottish Third Division title and securing promotion in 2011, and he has also played for several Scottish clubs as well as Östersunds in Sweden, while earning a Scotland Under-21 cap in the mid-1990s."

8-4,"Mr Mole, trained by Paul Nicholls and ridden by AP McCoy, is one of three 7-2 co‐favourites in the seven-runner Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday. He is grouped with Irish Raider Special Tiara and Nicky Henderson’s Sprinter Sacre (the latter to be ridden by Nico de Boinville due to Barry Geraghty’s injury). This race marks McCoy’s final Grade One ride on his last day as a professional jockey, with his final book of rides to be confirmed on Friday morning. Another contender in the race is Mick Channon’s Somersby."
11-1,"At 75 years old, Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one during Augusta National’s par-3 contest on the 130-yard fourth hole, thrilling the crowd while playing alongside Gary Player and Ben Crenshaw. Despite his celebrated shot—the first ace he achieved on Augusta’s hallowed turf—the day saw a record five hole-in-ones, with Camilo Villegas recording two but ultimately losing a playoff to Kevin Streelman. The passage also highlights Nicklaus’ storied career, mentioning his historic first green jacket win in 1963, his sixth in 1986, and his status as one of only five men who have completed the career grand slam."
11-3,"A juvenile female Omura's whale, a species once feared extinct and typically found in Indonesian, Philippine, and Sea of Japan waters, washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Cyclone Olwyn. This find marks the first sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. Initially hard to identify, the 5.68-meter whale was confirmed as an Omura's whale through DNA profiling. Noted for its sleek body and unique skeletal features—including a mention of both 53 and 67 vertebrae as well as four digits on each pectoral fin—the specimen is significant for scientists studying its regional distribution and improving identification guides. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover its skeleton in a few years for further research and possible museum display."
11-4,"A juvenile female Omura's whale, a species once feared extinct, washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in Western Australia after Cyclone Olwyn hit the region last month. This is the first record of the whale in Western Australia and only the second in Australia overall. Department staff confirmed its identity using DNA profiling. Described in scientific literature for the first time in 2003, the species is typically found in Indonesian, Philippine, and Sea of Japan waters, and its discovery is significant because little is known about it. Unique physical characteristics include a sleek body and distinct skeletal features. The carcass has been buried, with plans to recover the skeleton in a few years for further study and possible museum display."

10-0,"The passage reports that the ""black box"" of the Su-24 was unveiled in Moscow amid an investigation into missing flight data that might clarify where the jet was hit. The jet, shot down by Turkish F-16 fighters on 24 November over Syria, led to a crisis between Russia and Turkey. Turkey claims the jet ignored airspace warnings, while Russia insists it was within Syrian airspace, and Russian President Putin has harshly criticized Turkey. In the incident, although both crew members ejected, the pilot was killed—apparently by ground militants—and a Russian marine died during a rescue operation, with a helicopter also being destroyed. Russia has demanded an apology from Turkey and has imposed sanctions, including a ban on package holidays, potentially costing Turkey billions of dollars."
10-2,"An explosion occurred Monday night at a paraxylene plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian province, China, injuring six people—five of whom suffered broken glass injuries. An oil leak at an oil storage facility triggered the blast, leading to a large fire that was eventually controlled by over 600 firefighters. No toxic chemical spill was reported. The plant, controversial for its carcinogenic chemical production and pollution concerns, had previously experienced a similar explosion in 2013 and was originally meant for a more densely populated area before being relocated following public protests."
10-3,"In the autumn of 2004 in a Portsmouth garage, a 15‐year‐old girl met David Ayrton, who is now 34 and goes by the name Davina. She stands accused of raping the teenager while two of the victim’s friends slept nearby. During the trial at Portsmouth Crown Court, the victim described shouting and swearing at Davina to try and stop the attack, and it was revealed that the incident had been mentioned to a care worker in 2014. Davina denied the charge, and although she discussed her sexuality in court—explaining that she had not undergone any physical changes or taken medication—Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody with a sentencing date set for 4 March, noting that bail was not an option due to risks to herself and potential non-attendance, and stating that she would likely be held in a male prison with specific detention protocols in place."
10-4,"The passage reports that Eugene in the United States has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships. The IAAF council bypassed the usual bidding process—citing a unique strategic opportunity to stage the event in the USA—despite Eugene failing to win the bid for the 2019 championships (which were awarded to Doha). IAAF President Lamine Diack highlighted the strong collaboration of public authorities, the private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and an enthusiastic public as key factors in the decision. The passage also notes that a similar non-traditional awarding process was used for the 2007 championships in Osaka and mentions Mo Farah’s victory in the 2016 championships."
13-0,"The passage reports that L/Bdr Parkinson, who was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006, carried the Olympic torch on 26 June. Despite having suffered a brain injury that affected his speech, he has recovered enough to speak unaided and remains determined, continuing with extensive gym and rehabilitation work while walking with crutches.
