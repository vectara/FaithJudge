14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades attacked the Sardar Daud hospital in Afghanistan, detonating explosives at the gate and opening fire on staff and patients. Afghan commandos killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility, while the Taliban denied involvement. Over 50 people were wounded. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack as violating human values and religious sanctity. This incident marks a shift in IS tactics, as it is their first direct engagement with security forces in Kabul, previously targeting mainly civilian gatherings. Observers suggest IS may now have increased resources and military training, potentially leading to more attacks. IS has been active in Afghanistan since declaring its Khorasan Province in 2015, carrying out multiple deadly attacks, including recent assaults on Kabul's Supreme Court and religious gatherings. The Afghan government has struggled to fully dislodge IS from mountainous areas despite some successes. The Taliban has also continued attacks, recently killing 16 people in Kabul."

14-2,"Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by deciding to extend his term by only one year, until 2019, rather than leaving in 2018 as originally planned or staying until 2021. His decision was driven primarily by personal considerations, particularly his family's educational milestones and their planned return to Canada. Carney acknowledged the importance of providing stability during Britain's Brexit negotiations, but ultimately chose a shorter extension due to family circumstances. He emphasized that his decision was entirely personal, unrelated to political pressures or criticism of the Bank's Brexit forecasts. Theresa May supported his choice, leaving the decision entirely to him. Carney's departure in 2019 will coincide with the expected completion of the Article 50 process, after which a new governor will guide Britain's economic future."

15-3,"A major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that heavy drinking among Americans increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, primarily driven by rising rates among women. Binge drinking among women rose significantly faster than among men, with women's binge drinking rates increasing more than seven times the rate of men's nationwide. In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers. Despite these increases, the overall percentage of Americans who drink alcohol remained relatively stable. Experts attribute the rise in excessive drinking to changing social norms, increased affordability of alcohol, greater alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. Alcohol-related deaths in the U.S. were approximately 88,600 in 2010, with excessive drinking costing over $220 billion annually."

16-0,"The passage discusses two significant boxing events. First, it mentions the upcoming Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight, anticipated to be the biggest financially and most significant fight of the century, with its historical importance depending on the outcome. The passage then focuses extensively on the historic rivalry between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran. Their first fight ended controversially, with Duran winning by a confusing unanimous decision. In their famous rematch on November 25, 1980, Leonard strategically used speed and movement to frustrate Duran, who shockingly quit mid-fight, uttering the famous phrase ""no mas."" This surrender severely damaged Duran's reputation in Panama, taking three years to rebuild after he regained a world title. Leonard later won their third fight decisively in 1989, but he considered forcing Duran to quit in their second fight his greatest achievement."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy, currently ranked world number one, believes it is ""unthinkable"" that he will not eventually win the Masters to complete a career grand slam.

He describes his 2011 Masters collapse, where he lost a four-shot lead in the final round, as the most important day of his career, teaching him valuable lessons that helped him win subsequent majors. Despite having only one top-10 finish at Augusta, McIlroy remains confident he can win multiple Masters titles. He views the golf course as a sanctuary from external pressures, a mindset that previously helped him overcome personal distractions and achieve success."

16-4,"A three-bedroom apartment in Knightsbridge, one of Britain's most expensive areas, is listed for £575,000, significantly cheaper than neighboring properties. However, the low price is due to the apartment having only three years remaining on its lease and requiring extensive renovation. Extending the lease could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million, but would increase the property's value to around £6 million. The 1,990 sq/ft maisonette includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a reception room, utility room, lift, parking, and communal garden. Estate agents note that such short-lease properties rarely appear on the market, attracting significant interest from locals, developers, and end users. Experts caution potential buyers about the high cost of lease extension."

11-3,"An Omura's whale, a species feared extinct, was found washed up on a remote beach in Exmouth, Western Australia, following tropical cyclone Olwyn. This discovery marks the first sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. Initially difficult to identify, DNA profiling confirmed the whale as a juvenile female Omura's whale measuring 5.68 meters. Environment Minister Albert Jacob described the find as highly significant, as the species was only scientifically described in 2003 and remains poorly understood. Typically found in tropical and subtropical waters around Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, Omura's whales have a sleek body shape and unique skeletal features, although the passage provides conflicting information about the number of vertebrae (53 or 67). The whale's carcass has been buried, and its skeleton will be recovered later for scientific study and possible museum display."

Russia claims the jet was within Syrian airspace, while Turkey insists it violated Turkish airspace despite warnings. The incident severely strained Russia-Turkey relations, prompting Russia to impose sanctions, including a ban on package holidays, potentially costing Turkey billions.

Over 600 firefighters responded, and the fire is now under control. The plant previously experienced an explosion in 2013 without casualties or toxic leaks. PX plants have sparked protests in China due to pollution concerns, leading authorities to relocate this particular plant from densely populated Xiamen to its current remote location after public backlash in 2007."

Judge Ian Pearson remanded Ayrton into custody, likely at a male prison in Winchester, citing concerns about self-harm and failure to attend court. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, changed her name in 2012 but has not undergone physical changes or medication related to her sexuality. She disclosed the attack to a care home worker in 2014."

The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) council made this decision due to a unique strategic opportunity to hold the event in the USA for the first time. Eugene previously lost its bid for the 2019 championships to Doha, Qatar, but a recent presentation convinced the IAAF of Eugene's capability. IAAF President Lamine Diack emphasized the strategic importance of accessing the U.S. market and the collaboration among public authorities, private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and the enthusiastic public. The 2007 championships in Osaka, Japan, were similarly awarded without a bidding process. Mo Farah won gold in the men's 10,000 meters at the 2016 championships in Moscow."

13-2,"Hundreds of children in England were hospitalized last year due to brain damage caused by exposure to alcohol in the womb, according to new figures. Specifically, 272 children with disabilities from foetal alcohol syndrome were admitted to hospitals, but experts warn the actual number affected could be much higher. World Health Organization research suggests at least one in 100 UK babies—approximately 7,500 annually—could suffer learning, behavioral, and physical problems from prenatal alcohol exposure. Elizabeth Mitchell from the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome describes the issue as enormous, sad, and vastly under-diagnosed. One example is 15-year-old Niamh Brown, who requires constant care and will never live independently. Her adoptive parents founded the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Trust to support others. Alcohol exposure during pregnancy can also cause liver, kidney, heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. Current government guidelines advise pregnant women to avoid alcohol or limit consumption to two units twice weekly, but Mitchell advocates for a stricter recommendation of complete abstinence during pregnancy."
13-3,"Scotland's women's football team has won all five of their qualifiers and faces Iceland next, knowing a victory would nearly guarantee their qualification for next summer's finals in the Netherlands. Forward Lisa Evans emphasizes the emotional importance of qualifying, especially after narrowly missing out in previous play-offs for Euro 2013 and the World Cup. Iceland, ranked just above Scotland, is also unbeaten, making their upcoming matches crucial for deciding the group winner. Evans, who recently won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich, highlights the advantage of having many Scottish players competing in top international leagues, as it brings valuable experience and different playing styles to the national team."
13-4,"A video captured in Fort Pierce, Florida, shows a light general aviation aircraft performing a belly landing at Aero Acres Residential Airpark after the pilot failed to deploy the landing gear. The plane skidded along the runway, damaging its propellers and belly. Realizing the mistake, the pilot quickly re-engaged the engines, managed to regain control, and took off again despite the damage. Remarkably, the 85-year-old pilot, Chris Georgaklis, who has nearly 50 years of flying experience, successfully flew 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and landed safely. He was accompanied by his dog, Buddy. The FAA is investigating the incident, noting that gear-up landings typically result from human error or mechanical faults."

12-0,"An Omura's whale, a species feared extinct, was found washed up on a remote beach in Exmouth, Western Australia, following tropical cyclone Olwyn. This discovery marks the first sighting of the species in Western Australia and only the second in Australia. Initially difficult to identify, DNA profiling confirmed the whale as a juvenile female Omura's whale measuring 5.68 meters. Environment Minister Albert Jacob described the find as highly significant, as the species was only scientifically described in 2003 and remains poorly understood. Typically found in tropical and subtropical waters around Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan, Omura's whales have a sleek body shape and unique skeletal features, although the passage provides conflicting information about the number of vertebrae (53 or 60). The whale's carcass has been buried, and its skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific study and possible museum display."
