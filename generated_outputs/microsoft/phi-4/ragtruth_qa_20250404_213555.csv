15404,"The functions of a bird's air sacs include:

3. **Airflow Pathway**: During the respiratory cycle, air moves through the air sacs and eventually out of the body through the nasal cavity and nostrils. The air sacs facilitate the movement of air to and from the cranial air sacs and through the syrinx, trachea, larynx, and nasal cavity. 

These functions support the high metabolic rate of birds by ensuring efficient oxygen delivery."
