15599,"Blue Bell ice cream has temporarily shut down its manufacturing plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, due to listeria contamination found in a serving of ice cream from that facility. Public health officials have advised consumers not to eat any Blue Bell-branded products made at this plant, specifically 3-ounce servings marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S, or T behind the coding date. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not extended this warning to other Blue Bell products not made at the plant, but Blue Bell has recalled additional products as a precaution. This is the third action Blue Bell has taken in response to a listeria outbreak linked to its ice cream at a Kansas hospital. Listeria monocytogenes was found in a cup of ice cream from the Broken Arrow plant produced in April 2014, and genetic analysis showed a match between the bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample, though not identical to samples from patients in the Kansas outbreak. In a separate Texas outbreak, listeria samples from patients matched those from recovered samples of Blue Bell ice cream. The CDC is investigating whether these illnesses are related to Blue Bell products. In early March, Blue Bell recalled products made at a Texas plant due to the Kansas outbreak, later adding 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people in Kansas were infected, with three fatalities, and at least four had consumed milkshakes made with Blue Bell ice cream. Blue Bell CEO Paul Kruse expressed devastation and commitment to improving quality and safety. The CDC advises checking freezers for recalled products and disposing of them. This is the first product recall in Blue Bell's 108-year history. Listeriosis, caused by listeria, is a serious infection affecting vulnerable populations, with symptoms including fever and muscle aches. In the U.S., it causes approximately 1,600 serious illnesses annually, with a 16% fatality rate."
15601,"The passage discusses the fallout from a flawed article published by Rolling Stone about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia. An external review by Columbia Journalism School professors identified failures in reporting, editing, editorial supervision, and fact-checking at Rolling Stone. The magazine's managing editor, Will Dana, apologized to readers and those affected, including the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and UVA administrators and students.

The passage then explores the potential for defamation lawsuits by UVA, Phi Kappa Psi, or other fraternities. It explains that defamation requires a false and defamatory statement with the requisite intent. Public figures face a higher burden of proof in defamation cases than private individuals. UVA, as a public university, cannot sue for defamation. The passage discusses the challenges for fraternities, which are groups, to sue for defamation, noting that statements about a group generally do not allow individual members to sue unless the group is small and the statement can be imputed to all members. Phi Kappa Psi might argue that the ""small group"" exception applies, but Rolling Stone could counter that the fraternity's membership is too large and fluid for individualized injury.

The passage concludes by noting that defamation suits are rare and typically require proof of financial harm, making the UVA case unique but potentially viable if the fraternity members can demonstrate tangible damages."
15604,"The passage discusses the author's perspective on Rand Paul's presidential campaign announcement. The author, who became the first woman and person of color elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, criticizes Paul for attempting to launch his campaign on a platform that includes questioning voting and civil rights legislation. Despite Paul's claim of wanting to ""expand the Republican Party"" and appeal to minority communities, the author argues that his policies do not support this message. Paul's positions, such as opposing the Civil Rights Act, wanting to eliminate the Department of Education, limiting women's choices, and opposing protections for DREAMers, are highlighted as evidence of his lack of commitment to minority issues. The author also criticizes Paul for his dismissive remarks about the need for a robust Voting Rights Act and his condescending behavior at historically black colleges and universities. The author concludes that Paul's views are outdated and disqualifying for a presidential candidate, emphasizing the need for a leader who respects progress and democracy."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau and Vili Fualaau, who began an affair in 1996 when she was a 34-year-old teacher and he was her 13-year-old student, are now happily married. Letourneau served over seven years in prison for their relationship and gave birth to Fualaau's child. They married in 2005 after her release and are celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary.

Fualaau shares his struggles with alcoholism and depression and his belief that the system failed him as a minor. Letourneau Fualaau is now 53, and Fualaau is 31."
15616,"Kanye West settled a lawsuit with paparazzi photographer Daniel Ramos, whom he assaulted in July 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport. West had pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge for the incident, resulting in two years' probation, anger management sessions, and community service. Ramos's civil suit sought damages for interference with his lawful occupation. The case was dismissed after settlement, which included an apology from West to Ramos. The settlement details were not disclosed, but a statement from Ramos's lawyer, Gloria Allred, highlighted the apology and a handshake between West and Ramos. The incident was captured on video, showing West attempting to wrestle the camera from Ramos. Allred emphasized that the case underscored that celebrities are not above the law. Additionally, West had previously settled a separate assault accusation from January 2014."

15623,"Chris Copeland of the Indiana Pacers was stabbed after leaving a nightclub in New York's Chelsea neighborhood early Wednesday. The incident occurred in front of the Fulton Houses, not at the club, 1OAK, where Copeland and his companion, Katrine Saltara, had been for about 10 minutes. The suspect, a 22-year-old Brooklyn man, stabbed Copeland and Saltara, and a knife was recovered. Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, while Saltara was slashed on her arm, breast, and buttock. Another woman was also slashed in the stomach. The suspect was arrested after Copeland's driver attempted to detain him.

Two Atlanta Hawks players, Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha, who had just finished a game in Atlanta, were arrested on charges of obstruction and disorderly conduct after they tried to assist Copeland and were seen pushing through a crowd. They were not involved in the stabbing. The Hawks' team released a statement contesting the charges and apologizing for any negative attention caused. The Pacers and NBA are investigating the incident, and Copeland is in stable condition at a New York hospital. The Hawks are preparing for a playoff game against the Brooklyn Nets, with neither Antic nor Sefolosha expected to play. The incident was reported by local media, and police released limited information."
15627,"The passage discusses the creation of a hologram-like figure of Tejano star Selena, who died 20 years ago. Her family is developing a ""walking, talking, singing, and dancing digital embodiment"" of her, using technology from Acrovirt LLC. This project, named ""Selena the One,"" aims to allow new fans to experience Selena's persona. Suzette Quintanilla, Selena's sister, emphasized that this is not meant to replace Selena but to continue her legacy. The technology will enable the digital figure to autonomously learn and react. Selena will be the first to use this technology, and the project includes plans for new music releases, collaborations, and a 2018 tour. The family is also launching an Indiegogo campaign to support the project, with a commemorative event scheduled in Corpus Christi, Texas. The passage notes that Selena remains popular, with a significant online following. This initiative follows similar virtual performances by Michael Jackson and Tupac Shakur."
15628,"Alaska Airlines Flight 448, en route from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Los Angeles, had to make an emergency landing after the pilot heard unusual banging from the cargo hold. The noise was caused by a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines, who had fallen asleep in the pressurized and temperature-controlled cargo hold. The plane was airborne for only 14 minutes before the incident was discovered. Passengers heard the banging and subsequent screams for help, prompting a federal air marshal to respond by banging back and warning of the impending landing. The plane safely returned to Seattle, where emergency services surrounded it upon landing. The ramp agent was taken to a hospital as a precaution, passed a drug test, and was discharged. He had started his shift at 5 a.m. and was believed to have gone home before the flight departed. Alaska Airlines is investigating the incident, noting that all ramp employees undergo security checks and have badges. The flight eventually reached Los Angeles later that evening."
15634,"The passage discusses the citizenship status of Emy Afalava, a decorated veteran born in American Samoa, a U.S. territory. Despite being subject to American law his entire life, Afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government does not recognize him as a citizen. This situation contradicts the Fourteenth Amendment, which states that all persons born in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens. The passage highlights the historical context of racial discrimination in U.S. citizenship laws, referencing the Dred Scott case and the case of Isabel Gonzalez, a Puerto Rican woman denied entry to the mainland in 1904. The Supreme Court's past decisions have allowed for racial discrimination, particularly in territories like Puerto Rico and American Samoa. Afalava and other American Samoans are challenging this in a federal lawsuit, seeking recognition as U.S. citizens. The passage argues that it is time to end this injustice, as residents of other U.S. territories have already gained citizenship."
15638,"Iman Hashi, 25, and her sister Siham, 27, are recording their debut album in Los Angeles, far from their hometown of Mogadishu, Somalia, where they were born before fleeing the war in 1991. The sisters relocated to Canada as refugees and discovered a passion for music during their teens. They are now known collectively as Faarrow, a name derived from the English translations of their names: Iman means ""Faith"" and Siham means ""Arrow."" Their music is a fusion of Afro-pop, pop, hip hop, and African percussion, and they are working with Elijah Kelley, a producer and actor, on their album. The album was largely written and produced by the sisters and Kelley, and they have the support of Warner Brothers Records to maintain their creative vision.

In addition to their music career, the sisters are involved in humanitarian work with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). They started a non-profit organization, held benefit concerts, and worked as UNHCR spokespeople. They also launched a socially conscious fashion brand called ""Wish Creatively,"" which supports women in Kenya and Somalia by providing them with sustainable income.

Currently, the sisters are in the mixing process of their album, with plans to release the first single soon. They see themselves as creative spokespersons for their generation and Somalia, aiming to inspire others by following their dreams and not being confined to traditional career paths."
15651,"The passage discusses the challenges faced by the Pope in balancing spiritual and political responsibilities. The Pope leads nearly 1 billion Catholics and a significant state with global interests. The Vatican has historically navigated the intersection of spiritual and worldly concerns. The passage highlights a specific instance involving Pope Francis and the Armenian genocide. A century ago, over 1 million Armenians died, an event many historians and countries recognize as genocide, though Turkey disputes this characterization. Previous popes, including John Paul II and Benedict XVI, have cautiously addressed the issue. Pope Francis, during a Mass commemorating the Armenian genocide, referred to it as ""the first genocide of the 20th century,"" quoting a document by John Paul II. This approach maintained continuity with past papal statements while avoiding direct confrontation with Turkey, a key ally against ISIS. Turkey reacted negatively, recalling its ambassador from the Vatican. The passage notes Pope Francis's unique approach to geopolitics and diplomacy, emphasizing continuity in church policy while engaging in global issues. Despite potential controversy, Francis encouraged priests to speak frankly and courageously."
15652,"The passage describes National Park Week, which takes place from April 18 to April 26. During this week, the 128 National Park Service sites that usually charge a fee, such as Yellowstone and Yosemite, will be free on Saturday and Sunday. This initiative is part of National Park Week, hosted by the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation.

15661,"A second robotic probe was deployed by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) at the Fukushima nuclear plant to gather data after the first robot failed. The second robot captured images of a green glow and detected lower-than-expected radiation levels and temperatures, suggesting effective cooling systems. TEPCO noted a yellow discoloration on the grating, though the cause was unknown, and the green glow was not visible from other angles. The robots aim to assess damage in reactors affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The first robot, sent in on April 10, stalled after 10 meters due to a fallen object and was cut off on April 12 after collecting data from 14 of 18 locations. The second robot, deployed on April 15, successfully collected data from all 11 points. Despite the high radiation levels, decommissioning work is ongoing, estimated to cost $50 billion and take years. TEPCO described the robotic probe as an ""unprecedented"" experiment."
15665,"The passage describes the emotional and physical impact of the Boston Marathon bombings carried out by Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Jurors are hearing victim impact testimonies as they decide whether Tsarnaev should be sentenced to life or death. The bombings resulted in the deaths of four individuals, including Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, Martin Richard, and Sean Collier, and left many others severely injured. Testimonies highlighted the profound grief of the victims' families and the horrific injuries sustained by survivors like Gillian Reny and Celeste Corcoran, who lost both legs. The passage also contrasts the victims' stories with Tsarnaev's defiant demeanor during his arraignment. The prosecution emphasizes the cruelty of the attacks and Tsarnaev's lack of remorse, as he viewed his victims as the enemy. The trial's sentencing phase aims to convey the lasting impact on the victims and their families."
15667,"The passage provides a summary of the 50th anniversary of the Academy of Country Music Awards (ACM Awards) held at the Dallas Cowboys Stadium. Key highlights include:

15670,"A Polish Prince, Jan Zylinski, challenged UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader Nigel Farage to a duel in London's Hyde Park over Farage's immigration policy. Farage criticizes Britain's EU membership for allowing immigration from Eastern Europe, which he claims affects Britain's ability to manage its borders. In a YouTube video, Zylinski expressed frustration with discrimination against Poles in Britain, citing Farage's comments blaming migrants for traffic issues as an example. Holding a sword from his father, a WWII hero, Zylinski proposed a duel to resolve their differences. Farage declined, stating he did not intend to accept the challenge, and a spokesman suggested Zylinski should agree with Farage's view on Poland losing its young talent. UKIP advocates for Britain leaving the EU and ending free movement of labor. Zylinski also offered a verbal debate as an alternative. He posted another video highlighting Polish contributions to Britain, urging an end to hostility towards Poles."
15673,"Seven people, including Illinois State University associate men's basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch, died in a plane crash while returning from the NCAA tournament final. The crash occurred overnight Monday, about 2 miles east of the Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington, near Illinois State University. The aircraft, a Cessna 414, was coming back from the NCAA Final Four championship game in Indianapolis. The identities of the other victims were not immediately known. Ward, a former standout player at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and professional player in China, had been with Illinois State since 2012 and was promoted to associate head coach in 2014. Leetch, who joined ISU in 2005, had various roles in athletics before returning as deputy director in 2013. Both were remembered as well-respected and much-loved colleagues. The ISU community is grieving the loss, with President Larry Dietz expressing profound sadness and Athletic Director Larry Lyons highlighting their contributions and personalities."
15683,"The passage describes the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, focusing on the testimonies given during the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Steve Woolfenden, a biomedical researcher, recounted his experience of being injured and finding his son, Leo, conscious but bleeding. He used his belt as a tourniquet and was assisted by a good Samaritan. Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon, compared the injuries he saw to those from war zones. Heather Abbott, another victim, described her injuries and the difficult decision to have her foot amputated. Marc Fucarile, who was also injured, spoke about his severe burns and the challenges of using a prosthetic. The testimony included the tragic death of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who died from rapid blood loss and internal injuries. The prosecution aimed to portray Tsarnaev as remorseless, while the defense planned to present witnesses about his difficult upbringing. Tsarnaev's relatives arrived in Boston, though it was unclear if they would testify. The jury had to decide between the death penalty and life imprisonment for Tsarnaev."
15690,"Sofia Vergara, a successful Latina actress known for her role in ""Modern Family,"" is involved in a legal dispute with her ex-fiancé, Nick Loeb, over two frozen embryos from their relationship. The couple, who split in May 2014, created the embryos through in vitro fertilization in November 2013. Loeb is suing to prevent Vergara from destroying the embryos, which are stored at the Art Reproductive Center in Beverly Hills. The lawsuit, filed anonymously to protect privacy, seeks to prevent the destruction of the embryos until both parties agree on their fate. Loeb wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate without financial obligations from Vergara, whom he refers to as his ""ex."" Vergara, who has previously expressed a desire to have children with Loeb, is now reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello. The case raises questions about the legal rights to embryos, typically governed by prior agreements, and involves complex issues of religious, moral, and legal nature. The court will need to decide whether the embryos are considered human beings or property. This legal battle occurs as Vergara promotes her new movie, ""Hot Pursuit."""
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, a woman from Luxor, Egypt, has dressed as a man for 43 years to support her family in a conservative society. After becoming a widow at 21 and with no support from her siblings, she adopted male attire to work and provide for her daughter, Houda. Dahou worked as a brick maker and later as a shoeshine man, earning just enough to educate her daughter. Despite societal judgment, she maintained her male disguise to ensure her daughter's well-being. Her daughter, Houda, credits her mother for preventing her from ending up on the streets. After gaining attention from a television interview, the governor of Luxor offered Dahou a kiosk, which she accepted on the condition of meeting in male attire. Recently, Egypt's President recognized her as an ideal mother, and she expressed pride in her sacrifices for her family."
15695,"The passage describes the conclusion of the Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez, who was convicted of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd. The jury, after deliberating for over 35 hours across seven days, reviewed testimony from more than 130 witnesses and over 400 pieces of evidence. Lesa Strachan, the jury foreperson, expressed the emotional toll the trial took on the jurors. The conviction was announced by Strachan, who highlighted the excessive use of force in the shooting. Jurors, including Rosalie Oliver and Kelly Dorsey, emphasized that Hernandez's status as a football player did not influence their decision. They focused on his indifference to Lloyd's fate, as evidenced by his actions following the murder. The jurors were surprised by the public's reaction to their verdict and stressed the seriousness of their task, contrasting it with TV portrayals of trials. The trial's outcome means Hernandez will serve life without parole, and the jurors reflected on the impact of their decision, particularly on Lloyd's family and Hernandez's young daughter."
15696,"The passage describes an emergency landing of SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622 in Buffalo, New York, due to a reported pressurization problem. Larry Johnson, a passenger, recounted the fear and helplessness he felt during the incident, noting that a flight attendant had warned passengers about potential dizziness and breathing difficulties. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initially reported a pressurization issue but later did not reference it. Marissa Snow, a SkyWest spokeswoman, stated that three passengers lost consciousness, and fifteen were examined at the airport, though none were hospitalized. Maintenance found no pressurization issues with the aircraft, an Embraer E170. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident. A nurse on board, Mary Cunningham, attended to two sick passengers, noting symptoms related to oxygen levels. The flight, originally from Chicago to Hartford, Connecticut, descended 28,000 feet in three minutes. CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo described the descent as feeling like a roller coaster. Johnson, who was traveling with his family, expressed relief that the flight ended safely."
15700,"The passage discusses the trial and conviction of Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriots tight end, for the first-degree murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013. Unlike many defendants who claim remorse or present excuses, Hernandez displayed arrogance and bravado in court, even winking at his fiancée. His attorney claimed Hernandez ""witnessed"" the murder but did not commit it. Despite this, the jury found him guilty based on substantial circumstantial evidence, sentencing him to life without parole, along with convictions for unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition.

The passage reflects on Hernandez's troubled past, including his father's death when Hernandez was 16, and subsequent issues such as bar fights and drug use. Despite these challenges, he achieved success in football, winning awards and leading his team to victory. However, his off-field behavior raised concerns, and he was labeled a ""troubled player"" before being drafted by the Patriots. The NFL and the Patriots are praised for handling the situation appropriately by releasing him after his arrest.

The passage concludes by acknowledging the unpredictability of human behavior, noting that Hernandez's talent and opportunities did not prevent his downfall. It quotes Hernandez's nonchalant attitude as he was taken from the courtroom, suggesting a sense of resignation to his fate."
15702,"Louis Jordan, 37, was rescued after drifting at sea for 66 days on a 35-foot Pearson sailboat. He had left Conway, South Carolina, to fish but was caught in a storm that capsized his boat and broke his mast. Despite a broken shoulder, he managed to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but struggled against currents and storms. He survived by collecting rainwater and catching fish attracted to his laundry. Rescued by the Houston Express, he was in surprisingly good condition, with minimal weight loss and sunburn. His father, Frank Jordan, had reported him missing on January 29. Coast Guard officials found no reason to doubt his story. Jordan was taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital and was expected to return to his marina in Conway. His resilience and faith were credited for his survival."
15708,"The passage discusses the investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525, which resulted in the deaths of all 150 people on board. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin stated that no video footage from the plane had been used in the investigation, despite claims by German and French magazines of a cell phone video showing the final moments of the crash. The magazines, Bild and Paris Match, reported that the video was found at the wreckage site but did not publish it. The French accident investigation agency, BEA, and a French Gendarmerie spokesman denied awareness of such a video, noting that cell phones collected at the site had not yet been analyzed.

The investigation also revealed that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had a history of depression, which he disclosed to Lufthansa's flight training school in 2009. Despite this, Lubitz was deemed fit to fly, and Lufthansa shared his medical and training records with prosecutors. Investigators are exploring whether Lubitz feared losing his pilot's license due to his medical condition, which might have motivated the crash. French President Francois Hollande mentioned that DNA analysis could identify all victims by the end of the week. The recovery of personal belongings, including more cell phones, is ongoing. The passage also notes that the captain of the flight was not mentioned."
15714,"A nuclear submarine undergoing repairs at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire due to the ignition of rubber insulation between its light and pressure hull during welding work. According to Russia's state-run news agency ITAR-Tass, the submarine was in a dry dock and did not have any ammunition, nuclear fuel, or dangerous substances on board. The fire began on a submarine that had been under repair since November 2013. Yevgeny Gladyshev, a spokesman for the shipyard, confirmed that the nuclear fuel had been removed and that there were no armaments or hazardous materials on the submarine. The shipyard personnel evacuated the premises, and no injuries were reported. The fire was not considered a threat to people or the shipyard."
15733,"The passage discusses the controversy surrounding HBO's documentary ""Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,"" which is critical of the Church of Scientology. John Travolta, a prominent Scientologist and actor, expressed disinterest in the documentary, stating he has not seen it and does not plan to. He emphasized his positive experience with Scientology over the past 40 years and dismissed the documentary as being based on the negative experiences of disgruntled former members. Travolta, who is premiering his new film ""The Forger"" in Clearwater, Florida, credits Scientology with helping him cope with the death of his son, Jett, in 2009. He described the church as ""brilliant"" and suggested that neither he nor fellow Scientologist Tom Cruise would have anything negative to say about it."

15739,"The passage reports that 100 people on the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity have been affected by gastrointestinal illness, with 95 passengers and 5 crew members experiencing symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has not yet identified the cause of the illness. Two CDC staffers are scheduled to meet the ship in San Diego on Monday. The ship, which left San Diego on March 29 and last stopped in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on April 10, has increased cleaning and disinfection efforts and is working with the CDC to test specimens from the affected individuals. This is the third outbreak of gastrointestinal illness on the Celebrity Infinity, with previous occurrences in 2006 and 2013. The ship was built in 2001 and refurbished in 2011."
15740,"The passage describes the discovery of graffiti in a French chalk quarry, dating back nearly 100 years, left by World War I soldiers. The inscriptions, found in an underground city near Naours, France, include names and details of soldiers from various countries, such as Australia, the USA, and Britain. Photographer Jeff Gusky, who has documented the site, describes it as a ""treasure trove"" and refers to his work as ""The Hidden World of WWI."" The underground city, which dates back centuries and was rediscovered in the late 19th century, was used by soldiers during World War I for refuge. It was sealed in the 18th century and later became accessible after changing ownership in 2013. The site is extensive and dark, making exploration challenging. Gusky has identified 1,821 names, with 40% Australian, 55 American, and 662 untraced. The graffiti serves as a poignant reminder of the soldiers' desire to be remembered, with some, like HJ Leach, being killed shortly after leaving their inscriptions. Gusky emphasizes the human connection these writings provide to the men who lived a century ago."
15744,"The passage discusses the broader implications of a retracted Rolling Stone article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia (UVA). The retraction highlighted ongoing investigations into how UVA handles sexual assault allegations. Despite the article's inaccuracies, it brought attention to UVA's lack of expulsions for sexual assault, even in cases of admission, and prompted a review by the Virginia attorney general's office and a Title IX investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. The article also sparked discussions about a campus culture insensitive to victims, with reports of euphemisms for rape and reputations of certain fraternities. UVA responded by instituting a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault, though the specifics were unclear. The Columbia Journalism School criticized the article for poor fact-checking, suggesting that more thorough verification could have avoided the retraction. While the article's sensationalism overshadowed more common experiences of sexual assault, it did lead to policy changes and increased dialogue on the issue. However, some survivors fear the retraction may deter others from coming forward."
15747,"Jia Jiang, a Chinese-born American, embarked on a project called ""100 Days of Rejection"" after quitting his six-figure job to pursue entrepreneurship. This project was initiated to confront his fear of rejection following the decline of his tech start-up's investment. Jiang documented his experiences, which included asking strangers for money or an apple, and sharing them on a blog. His project gained attention when a video of him requesting a special donut from a Krispy Kreme manager went viral. This led to media appearances and speaking engagements, though his primary goal was personal growth and helping others overcome their fear of rejection.

Jiang's book, ""Rejection Proof,"" combines self-help and motivational autobiography, emphasizing that rejection is often less daunting than anticipated. He offers eight tips for handling rejection, including understanding that rejection is more about the rejector than the rejectee, not letting rejection measure an idea's merit, and using rejection as an opportunity for growth. Jiang's journey transformed his perspective on rejection, allowing him to embrace it as a pathway to opportunity rather than an obstacle."
15753,"Over the past year, more than 25,000 people, roughly the population size of Key West, Florida, have battled Ebola infections, with over 10,000 fatalities. Survivors face lasting changes in their lives, and the epidemic highlighted global vulnerability to disease and flaws in governmental protective systems. Although the largest Ebola epidemic in history has subsided, with initial predictions of over a million infections by January not materializing, new infections continue, with 30 confirmed cases reported in the week of April 5, the lowest since May 2014. In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has decreased significantly, leading to an excess of treatment facilities, while Guinea still faces challenges, including 19 confirmed deaths in a week, with seven identified post-mortem and 21 unsafe burials. The World Health Organization notes that while surveillance is improving, unknown transmission chains could lead to new infections. The passage also mentions the impact of Ebola on individuals such as grave diggers and first responders."
15759,"The passage discusses the shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager, highlighting the disturbing video evidence of the incident. The author, a defense attorney, expresses skepticism about self-defense claims from law enforcement, especially when such claims are contradicted by video evidence. The author argues that body cameras on police officers could prevent such tragedies by ensuring accountability and transparency. The passage notes the financial costs of deploying body cameras but suggests these costs are justified by the potential to reduce civil suits and improve public trust in law enforcement. The author acknowledges that body cameras are only a temporary solution to the deeper issue of racial bias in the criminal justice system, which disproportionately affects black men. The passage calls for broader social changes and improved police training to address these biases, while advocating for the immediate implementation of body cameras to highlight and mitigate racial bias in police interactions."
15778,"The passage describes the conditions and experiences of Yazidi refugees in the Shariya refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, near the front lines with ISIS. The camp, which opened six months ago, houses around 4,000 tents and is home to thousands of Yazidis who fled the ISIS assault on Sinjar in August. The passage highlights the dire circumstances faced by the Yazidis, including the separation of young women and girls by ISIS to be sold as slaves, and the forced conversion or execution of men. 

Ahlam, a Yazidi woman, recounts her family's capture by ISIS, their subsequent imprisonment, and the horrific conditions they endured, including witnessing the brutal execution of escapees. Despite the fear and danger, Ahlam and her family managed to escape to Iraqi Kurdistan, where they were reunited with her husband, Mahmoud. However, their joy is overshadowed by the continued captivity of Ahlam's parents and other Yazidis. 

Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, discusses the ongoing plight of the Yazidis and calls for international support to defeat ISIS and rescue the captives. Ahlam's survival is attributed to her breastfeeding and young children, which ISIS deemed made her ""impure"" for use as a sex slave. The passage ends with Ahlam's haunting memories of the screams of young women and girls taken by ISIS."
15779,"An American citizen, Debra Lobo, was shot while driving in Karachi, Pakistan, on Thursday. Lobo, a 55-year-old vice principal at Jinnah Medical and Dental College, was injured in the right cheek and left arm and is unconscious but expected to survive. The attack occurred as she was picking up her daughters from school. Two assailants on a motorcycle fired at her car and left pamphlets in Urdu stating ""America should be burnt."" Lobo, who has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Christian Pakistani librarian, is being treated at Aga Khan Hospital. The U.S. Consulate General in Karachi is in contact with Pakistani authorities to gather more information, and local police are investigating the incident."
15786,"Two Delaware boys, aged 16 and 14, are in a coma, and their father is unable to talk or move after falling ill, possibly due to pesticide exposure, during a trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands. The family, including the boys' mother, became sick more than two weeks ago at a villa in St. John, where they were renting a unit at the Sirenusa resort. They were airlifted to hospitals in the United States, with the boys in critical condition in Philadelphia. The father is conscious but immobile, while the mother has been released and is undergoing occupational therapy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suspects exposure to methyl bromide, a pesticide found at the villa, as the cause of the illnesses. The pesticide is known for its acute toxicity and is restricted for indoor use in the U.S. The EPA is conducting an ongoing investigation, including air and wipe sampling, to determine if a fumigation at the resort on March 18 led to the family's illness and if any laws were violated. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation, and Terminix, the pest control company involved, is cooperating with authorities. The family's attorney has not commented on the investigation, and the family is described as fighters facing a long recovery."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) has adopted a policy discouraging its members from participating in executions, stating that such activities contradict the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers. This decision was made at their annual meeting and is part of the association's ongoing opposition to using the term ""drug"" for chemicals used in lethal injections and laws mandating or prohibiting pharmacist involvement in such cases. The policy was reinforced due to increased public attention on lethal injections, highlighted by a Supreme Court decision to stay executions in Oklahoma following a problematic execution in the state. The APhA's stance aligns with other medical organizations like the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association. The passage also notes challenges in obtaining lethal injection drugs, such as pentobarbital, due to manufacturers ceasing sales for capital punishment, leading states to seek compounded alternatives."
15791,"The passage discusses a new approach to climate change conversations, focusing on its impact on public health rather than just environmental issues. This perspective was highlighted during a roundtable discussion at Howard University's College of Medicine, attended by President Barack Obama, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. The discussion emphasized the personal health implications of climate change, such as increased asthma cases, and the importance of addressing these issues to protect vulnerable populations.

President Obama shared personal experiences and historical context, noting improvements in air quality since the Clean Air Act. Dr. Murthy highlighted asthma as a personal and public health concern, exacerbated by climate change. Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the President, mentioned a study showing that many doctors see climate change affecting their patients' health.

The passage also notes the role of technology and public health officials in raising awareness and preparing for climate-related health impacts. The World Health Organization estimates significant future health risks due to climate change, including deaths from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure, and under-nutrition. Despite these concerns, a Gallup poll indicates that a significant portion of Americans remain skeptical about the effects of global warming.

The passage concludes with Obama's assertion that addressing climate change is feasible, drawing parallels to past successes in improving air quality through legislation and innovation."
15800,"Cyclist Wang Pingan experienced the theft of his mountain bike just days before completing a 460-day cycling journey across China, covering thousands of miles through every major province. The theft occurred in Shenzhen, southern Guangdong province, where Wang had locked his bike while visiting electronics markets. Despite initial police skepticism about recovery, the bike was eventually found and returned to Wang, thanks to surveillance footage and police efforts. The bike had been sold twice before being recovered. Wang, a recent university graduate, had embarked on his journey with a modest budget and had refused offers for a new bike, expressing a deep personal connection to his stolen bike. He described it as a ""best friend"" that accompanied him throughout his journey. With the bike recovered, Wang can complete his trip, including reaching Hainan Island, and reflect on the significant places he visited, such as Mohe, Urumqi, and Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture."
15817,"The passage describes the diverse motivations and perilous journeys of migrants from over 20 countries traveling to Libya as a gateway to Europe. Eritreans flee repression and indefinite military service, Somalis escape Al-Shabaab and clan warfare, and Syrians have lost hope of returning home. Young men from West Africa, including Senegal, sell their possessions to seek better opportunities in Europe, often joining family members who have already migrated. In 2014, over 80% of these migrants headed to the Libyan coast, using established smuggling routes that involve crossing deserts and mountains, facing risks like kidnapping and robbery.

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) and other researchers highlight the severe conditions and dangers faced by migrants, including starvation and high mortality rates. Eritreans and Syrians constitute a significant portion of the migrant traffic, driven by worsening repression and instability in their home countries. Economic hardship and conflict in West Africa also push many to migrate, with some facing destitution upon being stranded or repatriated.

The passage also notes the trafficking of African women for prostitution and the increasing organization of smuggling networks due to the influx of funds from the Syrian conflict. Migrants often pay smugglers for dangerous sea crossings, with Africans more vulnerable due to being locked in holds or using inadequate vessels. As Libya becomes more dangerous, other Mediterranean countries increase border security, but migrants continue to seek alternative routes, facing numerous challenges and risks. The passage concludes with a poignant reflection on the migrants' desperate quest for a better life and the grim realities they encounter."
11317,"The passage discusses the opposition of Walmart and other businesses to religious freedom laws in several states, which critics argue could lead to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. Walmart, a major retailer, criticized a religious freedom law in Arkansas, reflecting its support for gay rights and aligning with broader public opinion shifts. The company's CEO, Doug McMillon, urged Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to veto the bill, which he eventually did, pending changes. This stance places Walmart at odds with many Republicans, despite its historical support for the party. The passage highlights Walmart's evolving policies, such as enhancing nondiscrimination protections and offering benefits to same-sex partners, as part of its adaptation to a diverse consumer base and progressive views on gay equality. The backlash against similar laws in Indiana and Arkansas has garnered widespread business support for workplace equality, with companies threatening to withdraw from states passing such laws. The issue has also entered presidential politics, with candidates like Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz expressing differing views. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and business leaders have advocated for inclusive policies, emphasizing the importance of workplace equality for business communities."
11323,"The passage discusses Easter, a significant event in the Christian faith, celebrating Christ's Crucifixion and Resurrection. It highlights Easter's unique aspects, such as its shifting date each year based on lunar events and its connection to Passover. Unlike Christmas, Easter's date varies due to its alignment with the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. The passage also notes the recent appearance of a blood moon during Easter, linking it to lunar phases that determine both Passover and Easter.

The passage describes Easter traditions, including the Vatican's Holy Week celebrations and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, where Easter is celebrated differently by Western and Eastern Orthodox Christians due to calendar differences. It explores the origins of Easter's peripheral symbols, like the Easter bunny and eggs, tracing them back to German traditions and suggesting they were invented to explain the abundance of eggs after Lent.

Additionally, the passage offers a creative tip for coloring Easter eggs using Kool-Aid, a method suggested by YouTube science enthusiast Grant Thompson. The passage concludes with greetings for Easter and Passover."
11332,"The passage discusses a political discussion in Japan regarding extraterrestrial unidentified flying objects (UFOs), sparked by a question from former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki. Inoki asked Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani if the Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) had ever encountered UFOs. Nakatani responded that the ASDF had not encountered any UFOs from outer space, although they sometimes observe unidentified flying objects that turn out to be birds or other non-aircraft objects. Inoki, known for his diverse career including wrestling, politics, and media appearances, has seen a UFO himself but does not claim to know if aliens exist. This discussion follows previous political considerations about extraterrestrial threats, including a 2007 debate on the legal implications of defending against an alien invasion under Japan's pacifist constitution. Inoki is also noted for his unique personal style and various diplomatic and cultural endeavors."
11349,"Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old from Indiana, passed away after her inspirational battle with brain cancer. Her story gained global attention when she played her first college basketball game for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, after the NCAA allowed the game to be moved up to accommodate her wish. Hill's fight against diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, diagnosed in 2013, inspired many, and she helped raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research through The Cure Starts Now. Her legacy includes messages of positivity and perseverance, as highlighted by her principal and others who admired her strength and determination. Hill's impact was celebrated by many, including NBA star LeBron James and NCAA President Mark Emmert, who praised her as an inspiration worldwide. Her final game was a significant event, where she scored the first two points and the last layup, leaving a lasting legacy of courage and hope."
11353,"A section of a fiberglass boat, suspected to be debris from the 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami, was found off the coast of Oregon and towed to Newport. The boat, which traveled over 4,000 miles and took more than four years to reach Oregon, contained yellowtail jack fish typically found in Japanese waters. Biologists from the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center assessed the ecological threat of these invasive species as small. The boat will be dried, inspected, and disposed of in a landfill, while the yellowtail jack fish will be relocated to the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Richie Benaud, the former Australia cricket captain and legendary broadcaster, passed away at the age of 84. Known for his witty commentary, Benaud was a prominent figure in cricket both as a player and a broadcaster. He was a record-breaking leg-spinner and captain, leading Australia to never lose a series during his tenure from 1958/59 to 1963/64. Benaud was also the first cricketer to achieve a Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. After retiring as a player, he became a renowned broadcaster, known for his insightful and authoritative commentary, and was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. His voice was celebrated worldwide, particularly in the UK, where he worked with the BBC for over four decades. Benaud's passing drew widespread condolences, including from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who praised his embodiment of cricket's traditions and values. Tributes also came from cricket figures like Michael Clarke and Shane Warne, as well as international leaders and cricket personalities, highlighting his global impact and legacy in the sport. Benaud was born in 1930 in Penrith, New South Wales, and his contributions to cricket were honored with flags flying at half-mast on the day of his funeral."
11356,"Malala Yousafzai, a teenage education activist from Pakistan, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and recently had an asteroid named after her by NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer. Malala was seriously injured by a Taliban gunman for advocating girls' education but recovered without serious neurological damage. Mainzer, who works at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and consults for a PBS children's science show, named the asteroid 316201 Malala (or 2010 ML48) in her honor. This asteroid, discovered by Mainzer in 2010, orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and a half years and is about 4 kilometers in diameter with a very dark surface. Mainzer highlighted the importance of honoring women, especially women of color, through such naming and emphasized the need for educating girls worldwide to harness human potential for solving global challenges."
11366,"An explosion occurred late Thursday outside a bus station in Gombe, Nigeria, killing at least five people and injuring over a dozen others. The incident took place at the Bauchi Motor Park around 8:30 p.m. when a woman left an explosives-laden handbag near a bus heading to Jos. The explosion set the bus on fire, resulting in severe injuries, including amputations and eye injuries. Witnesses reported that the woman pretended to be waiting for the bus and then left the bag before disappearing. Although no group claimed responsibility, Boko Haram is suspected due to their history of similar attacks in the region. The group has been weakened by regional offensives but continues to target soft locations. This attack occurred shortly after Nigeria's presidential election, won by Muhammadu Buhari, who has pledged to combat Boko Haram."
11370,"The passage discusses the significance of the handshake between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro at the Summit of the Americas in Panama, highlighting it as a historic moment in the normalization of U.S.-Cuba relations. However, the passage emphasizes that this event should not overshadow the broader goals of the summit. President Obama aims to strengthen U.S. ties with Latin American countries, which have drifted due to America's focus on domestic issues and instability in the Middle East. The U.S. has lost influence in the region to China, Russia, and Iran, and the summit presents an opportunity to reverse this trend by leveraging the strong cultural and demographic ties between the U.S. and Latin America.

The passage reflects on past summits where the U.S. faced diplomatic challenges, such as the Cartagena summit, where Secret Service misconduct and opposition from regional leaders over Cuba's exclusion marred the event. It contrasts these setbacks with the optimism of the early Clinton years, when the U.S. promoted democracy, free trade, and economic growth in Latin America.

President Obama's new Cuba policy is noted, but the passage criticizes the U.S. approach to Venezuela, suggesting it has inadvertently strengthened the regime of Nicolas Maduro. The passage argues that Obama should focus on promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, aligning U.S. goals with those of Latin American people. Meeting with Cuban dissidents is seen as a positive step, indicating a commitment to human rights alongside improved relations with Cuba. The passage concludes that if Obama can demonstrate the U.S. as a genuine partner in improving lives in Latin America, he can leave a lasting legacy beyond the symbolic handshake."
11384,"The passage recounts a personal experience of sexual harassment on a crowded train in Mumbai, where the narrator, at age 13, was groped but felt unable to react due to the crowd. This incident, which was not reported at the time, is part of a broader pattern of sexual harassment faced by women in India, including groping, stalking, and non-consensual photography. A study by We the People found that 80% of women in Mumbai have experienced street harassment, often in crowded areas. The passage highlights that many forms of harassment, such as ogling and catcalling, are often overlooked, leading women to alter their behavior to avoid harassment. The narrator notes that sexual harassment is pervasive in India, affecting women in public spaces, workplaces, and daily life. Despite laws against sexual violence, cultural challenges and fear of police response often deter women from reporting incidents. However, recent cases show that reporting can lead to consequences for perpetrators, as seen in the cases of Rajendra Pachauri and Tarun Tejpal. The passage emphasizes the importance of speaking out against harassment and the role of allies in supporting women to overcome barriers and change the culture around sexual harassment in India."
11395,"Mountaineers have resumed climbing Mount Everest for the current season after a deadly 2014 season, which ended with a glacial ice avalanche killing 16 Nepalis. This incident sparked debates about the risks faced by Sherpas and climbers. To enhance safety, the route through the dangerous Khumbu Icefall has been changed to a central path, which is longer but considered safer. The Nepal Ministry of Tourism issued 347 permits this year, a slight increase from last year. The new route requires crossing more crevasses and using additional ladders, with recommendations to limit gear weight. Some companies, like Alpenglow Expeditions, have opted for the northern route from China, which lacks an icefall but has harsher weather and terrain. The northern route's popularity is increasing, causing concern for Nepali tourism. Sherpas, who rely on guiding for income, face family pressure due to the risks involved. Jon Reiter, a climber affected by last year's tragedy, is returning to Everest, reflecting on the inherent risks of mountain climbing."
11400,"The passage discusses the increasing trend of individuals conducting their own medical tests, often referred to as ""National Get Tested Month."" Influential figures like Mark Cuban and Taylor Swift have encouraged people to get tested, and legislation in some states, such as Arizona, allows individuals to order lab tests without a doctor's order. The passage highlights the potential downsides of this trend, including the risk of developing medical issues like anemia from excessive testing, increased anxiety, unnecessary procedures, and higher healthcare costs due to false alarms and subsequent testing. It also notes that while diagnostic tests can be beneficial for acute medical issues, they may not improve the well-being of healthy individuals. The passage suggests that while the freedom to test is not inherently bad, it requires regulation and public education to prevent misuse and misunderstanding of medical data. It concludes by cautioning that more testing does not necessarily equate to better health."
11410,"Canadian fighter jets, specifically CF-18 Hornets, conducted their first airstrike against ISIS in Syria, targeting a garrison near Raqqa, the group's de facto capital. This action, described as successful by Canada's Department of National Defence, is part of the U.S.-led coalition's efforts to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Canadian forces have previously conducted airstrikes in Iraq since November. Prime Minister Stephen Harper had announced plans to expand these airstrikes into Syria, and Defense Minister Jason Kenney emphasized Canada's commitment to combating terrorism and promoting international security. The airstrike was executed under an expanded mandate, and the Canadian aircraft returned safely to base. The exact number of casualties from the strike was not immediately known. The U.S. and other Western and Middle Eastern nations are also involved in the campaign against ISIS, which has imposed its strict interpretation of Islam in the regions it controls, resulting in significant violence and persecution."
11768,"In recent weeks, there have been notable births of multiples. On April 8, the first set of female quintuplets in the world since 1969 was born in Houston. Danielle Busby delivered the quintuplets—Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate, and Riley Paige—at 28 weeks and two days via C-section at the Woman's Hospital of Texas. The family, which now includes big sister Blayke, is blogging about their experience at ""It's a Buzz World."" Danielle Busby expressed gratitude for the hospital and her faith. Early reports claimed these were the first all-female quintuplets born in the U.S., but records show quintuplet girls were born in 1959 in San Antonio, though they all died within 24 hours. Separately, Sharon and Korey Rademacher kept the gender of their second child a secret, expecting twins. They gave birth to Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith on March 11 in Pensacola, Florida, and recorded the family's reactions, which was uploaded to YouTube and viewed over 700,000 times."
11779,"The passage describes changes to the U.S. no-fly list policy, allowing Americans on the list to know why they are banned from commercial flights and to dispute their status. This change follows a June federal court ruling that the previous process violated the Fifth Amendment's due process guarantee, stemming from an ACLU lawsuit on behalf of 13 Americans. Despite the policy revision, the ACLU criticizes the new process for not meeting constitutional standards, as it still denies meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing. Previously, individuals were only informed that they were denied boarding without confirmation of their no-fly list status. The new policy, part of the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP), provides more transparency by informing individuals of their status upon request and allowing them to submit further information to dispute their listing. The government will provide an unclassified summary of the reasons for inclusion on the list, considering national security interests. Individuals can dispute their status in writing and receive a final decision from the Transportation Security Administration. The policy changes were prompted by a 2014 ruling that called for the opportunity to dispute no-fly list status before a judge."
11791,"A Texas veterinarian, Dr. Kristen Lindsey, posted a photo on Facebook showing her shooting an arrow into a cat's head, claiming it was a feral cat. The post led to public outrage, with calls to the clinic and a crash in its website traffic. It was later suggested that the cat might have been a pet named ""Tiger,"" owned by an elderly couple. Despite Lindsey's claim that she did not lose her job, the clinic fired her, covered her name on its marquee, and distanced itself from her actions. The clinic and Lindsey did not comment further, and Lindsey eventually removed the post and shut down her Facebook page. The sheriff's office in Austin County is investigating, and Lindsey could face charges. Animal rights activists are advocating for charges, offering a reward for evidence. Some people defended Lindsey, describing her as a caring veterinarian, while others criticized her actions. The clinic is working to repair its reputation following the incident."
11795,"A video captured by CNN affiliate WMAR shows a woman angrily confronting her son during the Baltimore riots. The woman, seen in light blue jeans, a yellow lace tunic, and a cropped yellow jacket, is pulling her masked son away from a crowd, hitting him in the head, and yelling at him. She follows him, demanding he return, after seeing him on television throwing rocks at police. The boy, wearing dark pants, a black hoodie, and a dark backpack, eventually faces her without a mask. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts praised the woman for taking charge of her son, expressing a wish for more parents to do the same. The woman's name was not disclosed."
11808,"The passage describes the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in Nepal, focusing on the Kavre District and the village of Ravi Opi. The earthquake caused significant damage to infrastructure, including massive cracks in the main highway east of Kathmandu, which have been temporarily filled with rubble and dirt. Despite being only 30 kilometers from the capital, the journey to Ravi Opi takes nearly two hours due to damaged roads.

In Ravi Opi, 90% of houses are uninhabitable, with some still standing but deemed unsafe due to aftershocks. The village, which is off the main highway, is primarily agricultural, with residents farming corn, millet, and vegetables. While the area was relatively less affected compared to regions closer to the epicenter, damage is evident, and there are reports of entire villages being destroyed or buried by landslides.

The passage highlights personal stories of loss and survival. Maili Tamang, a 62-year-old woman, recounts her experience during the earthquake and the destruction of her home. Her daughter-in-law was injured and transported to a hospital. Mahesh Koiraba lost his two-year-old daughter, Prati, when their house collapsed. Displaced families, including Osminda Koirale, express their fear and lack of support, as no government aid has reached them yet. The region faces ongoing challenges, including aftershocks and heavy rain, complicating recovery efforts. The passage underscores the dire situation in remote areas of Nepal, where the full extent of the disaster remains unknown."
11817,"The passage describes Marvel Comics superhero Hawkeye, known for his archery skills, as having a secret talent for singing Ed Sheeran parodies. On ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" actor Jeremy Renner, who plays Hawkeye, performed a reworked version of ""Thinking Out Loud"" to showcase his singing abilities. Renner humorously highlighted his other talents, including his collection of scarves and berets, playing the trombone, and opening pickle jars. Despite these talents, he joked that Thor would defeat him in a fight. Renner is noted for his diverse acting roles, including appearances in ""Avengers"" films, ""The Hurt Locker,"" ""American Hustle,"" and the ""Bourne"" and ""Mission Impossible"" franchises. The passage references a clip available on Billboard.com."
11821,"In the upcoming ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" Olivia Munn will portray the telepathic character Psylocke, as announced by director Bryan Singer on Instagram. Munn, known for her role in ""Newsroom,"" will play Betsy Braddock, the character's original identity, before any plot twists that alter her appearance. The film is in production for a summer 2016 release, specifically on May 27, 2016. Psylocke, created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe, originally appeared in the ""Captain Britain"" series and later joined the X-Men in 1987. Munn joins a cast including James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence. She is represented by Creative Artists Agency and Atlas Artists."
11826,"Stephen Hawking has collaborated with Monty Python to recreate the ""Galaxy Song"" from their 1983 film ""The Meaning of Life,"" in honor of Record Store Day. The 7-inch single will be available for sale, and the accompanying video features a humorous scene where Hawking, in his wheelchair, knocks over scientist Brian Cox, who criticizes the song's inaccuracies. Hawking then sings the song in his computerized voice and takes a virtual journey through the cosmos. The ""Galaxy Song,"" written by Monty Python's Eric Idle and John Du Prez, is described as an amusing and informative pop song about the universe. Hawking's version is available for download, and this is not his first music project, as he has also appeared on the Pink Floyd song ""Talkin' Hawkin'."" The original song includes lyrics about the vastness and motion of the universe."
11838,"The passage reflects on the author's experience at a peaceful demonstration in Miami in 1980, protesting the acquittal of police officers in the beating death of Arthur McDuffie. The author, then 12, witnessed the demonstration turn violent, drawing parallels to similar events in Baltimore in 2015 following Freddie Gray's death in police custody. The passage discusses the historical context of race riots in the U.S., noting that perceived unjust police actions have often been catalysts, such as in the 1960s and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The author highlights the role of riots in advancing civil rights by drawing attention to systemic issues, despite their destructive nature. The passage also mentions the author's involvement in moderating a panel on the topic, exploring whether riots are purposeless violence or purposeful uprisings. It concludes by emphasizing the power of nonviolent protest, as seen in Ferguson, Missouri, and the ongoing efforts to address systemic issues highlighted by such protests."
11839,"The Israeli military conducted airstrikes on Sunday night in the Golan Heights, targeting militants allegedly attempting to plant a bomb on the Israeli border. The airstrikes were aimed at four militants who crossed from Syria into the area. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the militants intended to detonate an explosive device against IDF forces, but the airstrikes prevented the bombing. Three of the militants were reportedly killed, though their affiliation with any specific militant group was not immediately known. The Golan Heights, where the incident occurred, is internationally considered occupied territory, despite Israeli control. It is home to 41,000 residents, including Jews, Druze, and Alawites, and was seized by Israel from Syria during the 1967 Israel-Arab war before being annexed."
11840,"The passage describes a logic problem known as ""Cheryl's Birthday,"" which became popular after being posted by Singapore television host Kenneth Kong on Facebook. The problem was originally intended to challenge high-school students at the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. Cheryl provides a list of 10 possible birthday dates to her friends Albert and Bernard, and through their conversation, the reader can deduce her actual birthday by eliminating nine of the dates. The problem has gained significant attention online, with solutions provided by sources like Georgia Tech Mathematician Matt Baker, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. The problem is compared to the viral ""What color is the dress"" debate due to its widespread discussion and varying solutions on the Internet."
11858,"The passage describes a severe HIV outbreak in rural Scott and Jackson counties in Indiana, linked to the use of the prescription opioid Opana. Since mid-December, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, with 136 confirmed cases. The outbreak is significant given the small population of the area. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health leaders are addressing the crisis, which has been exacerbated by the sharing of needles among IV drug users. Scott County, the outbreak's epicenter, has limited health resources, with only one doctor handling infectious diseases, who is not an HIV specialist. In response, Indiana declared a public health emergency in March, and Indiana University has provided a weekly clinic for treatment and testing. Efforts include education on needle sharing and a 30-day executive order for a needle exchange program, extended by Governor Mike Pence. The outbreak highlights the dangers of prescription drug abuse and needle sharing, with a noted increase in hepatitis C cases nationally. Health leaders emphasize the need for vigilance to prevent the spread of infectious diseases."
11860,"A legal petition has been filed by Joni Mitchell's longtime friend, Leslie Morris, seeking to be named her conservator. Mitchell, a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, was admitted to UCLA Medical Center after being found unconscious at her home and remains hospitalized. Morris, who has known Mitchell for over 44 years, claims in her April 28 petition that Mitchell is unconscious and unable to respond or care for herself. However, a statement on Mitchell's website, approved by Morris, contradicts this by stating that Mitchell is alert and comprehending, with a full recovery expected. Mitchell's publicist confirmed the website's accuracy. A doctor's declaration suggests Mitchell will be unable to attend court hearings for the next four to six months. Fans are paying tribute to Mitchell at WeLoveYouJoni.com."
11870,"The passage discusses anticipated criticism of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign regarding potential conflicts of interest involving foreign donors to the Clinton family's charities. This scrutiny is expected to be highlighted in Peter Schweizer's book ""Clinton Cash,"" set to release on May 5. The book will explore how foreign governments and businesses may have contributed to the Clintons' wealth through donations to their charities. The Clinton Foundation received funds from various foreign entities, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Canada's foreign affairs department, which was promoting the Keystone XL pipeline. The State Department, led by Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, endorsed the pipeline, raising questions about potential influence from donations.

Additionally, the Clinton Global Initiative, a sister organization, had partnerships with banks under investigation or fined by government agencies. However, there is no evidence that the Clintons were aware of these investigations. The passage notes that while these issues are serious, they may not significantly impact voters, who are more concerned with local issues like unemployment and taxes. The Clinton charities have also faced criticism for poor management and financial deficits, but these issues are not new. The passage suggests that unless Schweizer's book reveals new information, concerns about the Clintons' charities may not significantly affect Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, as voters are more focused on other issues. Clinton herself appears unconcerned, viewing the scrutiny as a distraction."
11875,"Andrew Lesnie, an Oscar-winning cinematographer known for his work on the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"" films, has passed away at the age of 59. Lesnie, a Sydney native, collaborated with director Peter Jackson on these films, as well as on ""King Kong"" (2005) and ""The Lovely Bones"" (2009). He also worked on ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011) and ""The Water Diviner,"" the directorial debut of Russell Crowe. Lesnie won an Oscar for his cinematography on ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001). He was recognized for his ability to balance technology with artistic considerations and was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002. Lesnie passed away after suffering a heart attack. His career included work on films like ""I Am Legend"" (2007), ""The Last Airbender"" (2010), and ""Healing"" (2014). He began his career in film and television education and worked as a camera assistant before gaining recognition for his work on ""Babe"" (1995) and its sequel, which led to his collaboration with Jackson."
11877,"The passage discusses the significant risks posed by Google's Waze app, which allows users to locate police officers in real-time. In 2014, ambush attacks were the leading cause of felonious deaths among law enforcement officers, and Waze's ""traffic cop"" feature exacerbates this risk by enabling users to identify police locations. The app was used by Ismaaiyl Brinsley to track police officers before he assassinated two New York officers. Despite Google's acquisition of Waze in 2013 for $1.1 billion and its mission to organize information for the common good, the app's potential to endanger officers and obstruct law enforcement is concerning. The feature is also misused by individuals seeking to evade law enforcement, such as drunk drivers and perpetrators of domestic violence. Google has refused to engage with law enforcement organizations like the National Sheriffs' Association to address these concerns, despite its reputation for corporate social responsibility. The passage argues that Google should collaborate with law enforcement to ensure both public safety and the safety of officers."
11888,"The passage describes photographer Simon Brann Thorpe's project ""Toy Soldiers,"" which aims to offer a fresh perspective on how images of war are consumed through mainstream media. Driven by the idea of how war imagery can become desensitized, Thorpe traveled to the Western Sahara desert, a region with a long-standing conflict between the Polisario Front and Morocco. He used the harsh landscape as a backdrop for soldiers from the Polisario Front, posing them as green plastic figurines to create a visual metaphor. This project highlights the real soldiers behind the imagery, prompting viewers to develop their own responses to war and conflict.

Thorpe, originally a landscape photographer, chose historic battle locations for his project, emphasizing the lack of media coverage on the Western Sahara conflict, despite its 40th anniversary in 2015. He worked with about 50-60 soldiers at a time, requiring clearance from the Polisario Front and careful coordination to avoid needing UN permission. The project involved long hours in the desert, with soldiers helping to construct platforms from old oil drums for the photos. Thorpe hopes his images will provoke questions about future consumption of war imagery in an era of diminishing attention spans. His ""Toy Soldiers"" book is available for pre-order, and he is active on social media platforms."
11900,"A gunman entered a building on the campus of Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and shot and killed the school's print shop operator, Ron Lane. The school was placed on lockdown, and the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, remains at large. Stancil, who is described as ""armed and dangerous,"" was a former employee of the victim and a former student at the school. The incident, which occurred on the third floor of a campus building, led to a lockdown and the clearing of all buildings. Authorities clarified that the shooting did not take place inside the library. The school's president, Kay Albertson, expressed sorrow over the loss and praised the response from various law enforcement agencies. Crime statistics from 2011 to 2013 show no killings, assaults, robberies, or motor vehicle thefts at the school, with three arrests for illegal weapons possession in both 2012 and 2013. The student population in fall 2013 was 3,837, with slightly more than half being part-time students."
11908,"The passage describes a collaboration between Colorado's New Belgium Brewery and Ben & Jerry's to create a beer inspired by salted caramel brownie ice cream. Both companies, known for their social activism, aim to raise awareness on issues they are passionate about through this project. New Belgium's Director of Sustainability, Jenn Vervier, and Ben & Jerry's Senior Global Marketing Manager, Jay Curley, have expressed excitement about the campaign, which will be announced later in the year with the beer set to be released in the fall. Both companies are B Corporations, committed to social, environmental, accountability, and transparency standards. New Belgium focuses on sustainable agriculture and climate change, while Ben & Jerry's supports environmental initiatives, fair trade, and marriage equality. The passage also mentions Ben & Jerry's cofounder Ben Cohen's openness to the idea of marijuana-infused ice cream, though there is no current plan for a beer-flavored ice cream."
11910,"The passage describes the NCAA men's basketball Final Four games held in Indianapolis. The Wisconsin Badgers defeated the Kentucky Wildcats 71-64, ending Kentucky's bid for a perfect season. Wisconsin, led by Frank Kaminsky with 20 points and 11 rebounds, overcame a 60-56 deficit with an 8-0 run. Kentucky's Karl-Anthony Towns scored 16 points, and the Harrison twins contributed 25 points combined. Wisconsin aims to win its first title since 1941.

In the other game, Duke defeated Michigan State 81-61. Freshman Justise Winslow led Duke with 19 points, and Jahlil Okafor added 18 points. Duke's defense was strong, and they increased their halftime lead from an early deficit to 36-25. Michigan State's Denzel Valentine scored 22 points, but the team struggled offensively in the second half. Duke, which has previously won titles in Indianapolis, will face Wisconsin in the title game. If Duke wins, it will tie Indiana and North Carolina for third-most NCAA championships with five. Duke had previously beaten Wisconsin 80-70 in December."
11911,"The passage describes ongoing conflict in Yemen, focusing on recent developments involving Saudi-led airstrikes and Houthi rebel activities. Saudi forces resumed airstrikes in southern Yemen after Houthi rebels attacked a Yemeni government military brigade. This followed the end of Saudi Arabia's Operation Decisive Storm and the start of Operation Renewal of Hope, which aims to focus on the political process. The airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in Taiz, with the duration and intent of the strikes unclear.

Houthi rebels have called for peace talks, contingent on a halt to attacks, following the failure of previous talks in January due to Houthi attacks on the Yemeni president's residence. The Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi, who had been detained since March 26, shortly before the Saudi airstrike campaign began. The Saudi-led coalition aims to restore the Yemeni government, a U.S. ally, and degrade Houthi military infrastructure.

Saudi officials claim the airstrikes have achieved their objectives and that the Houthis have agreed to most U.N. Security Council demands, including the departure of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family from Yemen. The coalition's next phase includes protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian aid, and confronting terrorism.

Former Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who claims to be the legitimate leader, thanked the coalition and expressed intentions to restructure the Yemeni military and return to Yemen to rebuild the country. Meanwhile, U.S. drone strikes targeted al Qaeda militants in southern Yemen, with two strikes reported in Mukalla and Shabwah. The U.S. is conducting reconnaissance off Yemen to ensure maritime security, not to interdict Iranian ships."
11922,"The passage describes the dire situation in Ramadi, Iraq, where ISIS militants are threatening to take control of the city. Falih Essawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, reports from within Ramadi that government troops are struggling to hold their positions against the ISIS offensive. Essawi, who is on the front line, calls for urgent reinforcements and air support from the Iraqi government and the U.S.-led coalition. He highlights the rapid collapse of security in the city and the need for immediate military assistance. The situation is critical, with at least 10 Iraqi security forces killed and over 100 wounded in recent fighting. ISIS has made significant advances in areas east of Ramadi, and the city is under pressure from multiple directions. The offensive has driven at least 150,000 people to flee, causing traffic jams on escape routes. Despite U.S.-led airstrikes, ISIS remains resilient, and the city remains contested. Essawi criticizes the Iraqi government for its lack of response, referencing a recent meeting between Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and U.S. President Barack Obama. The passage also includes accounts from residents fleeing ISIS advances, illustrating the human impact of the conflict."
11932,"The passage discusses Equal Pay Day on April 14, highlighting the gender wage gap where women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn, with the gap being even wider for women of color. It suggests that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should announce a 23% pay cut to match the wage gap, symbolizing solidarity with working women and pledging not to accept a raise until all women do. The passage explains that Equal Pay Day represents the additional time women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year, and closing the wage gap could significantly reduce poverty among single mothers. The author argues that Clinton's proposed pay cut would be a powerful political statement, aligning her with the fight for equality and addressing perceptions of her being out of touch due to her wealth. The passage also notes the symbolic importance of such a gesture in today's media-driven political culture, where image often influences public perception as much as policy. Clinton's campaign is portrayed as focusing on the needs of ordinary Americans, and the passage suggests that her actions could have a meaningful impact on the lives of women in the U.S. if she becomes president."
11945,"The passage discusses the treatment of women by modern jihadi groups like ISIS and Boko Haram, highlighting their strategic use of brutality as part of their broader goal to establish a Sharia-ruled caliphate. Unlike previous jihadi groups, these organizations actively incorporate women into their societal structures, using them as tools for building and maintaining their envisioned communities. Women are subjected to enslavement, sexual assault, and forced marriage, serving roles beyond mere spoils of war. This systematic abuse is part of a calculated strategy to control and subjugate women, ensuring their participation in the daily life of territories under jihadi control. The passage notes that this approach is distinct from earlier jihadi movements, which did not prioritize the immediate establishment of a caliphate. The treatment of women by these groups is described as a methodical effort to enforce their radical vision, with severe restrictions and abuses leading some women to attempt suicide. The passage also references historical instances of using rape as a weapon of war, but emphasizes that the current approach by ISIS and Boko Haram is more about integrating women into their societal framework, rather than merely using them as tools of war."
11948,"The passage describes SpaceX's attempt to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying the uncrewed Dragon spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida, to the International Space Station (ISS). The launch was initially postponed due to weather, with a new opportunity scheduled for Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET. The challenging part of the mission is landing the rocket's bottom stage upright on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean, a feat never accomplished before. This effort aims to reduce space access costs by reusing rockets, similar to airplanes, as envisioned by SpaceX founder Elon Musk. SpaceX has a 50% estimated success rate for this landing attempt, having previously failed in January when the rocket exploded upon impact. The top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit, where it will deliver over 4,300 pounds of supplies to the ISS, including an espresso maker. After five weeks, the Dragon will return to Earth with experiments and other cargo, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. This mission marks SpaceX's sixth delivery to the ISS, and the company was the first private contractor to dock with the station."
11979,"The passage describes the ongoing deliberations in the Boston Marathon bombing trial involving Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who faces life imprisonment or the death penalty for his role in the 2013 bombings. Jurors have been deliberating for over seven hours and have submitted two questions to be addressed the following day. The trial has included emotionally charged testimony and graphic evidence, such as videos of the bombings and their aftermath, highlighting the severe injuries and deaths caused. Prosecutors argue that Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, intentionally targeted civilians to terrorize the United States, with Tamerlan being the instigator. The defense, led by Judy Clarke, contends that Dzhokhar was heavily influenced by his older brother and should be spared the death penalty. The trial has featured testimony from 92 witnesses for the prosecution and four for the defense, with the prosecution presenting evidence of the brothers' radicalization and the meticulous planning of the attacks. If Tsarnaev is found guilty on at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a penalty phase to consider aggravating and mitigating factors."
12008,"The passage discusses the changing attitudes toward marriage among millennials, suggesting a potential decline in marriage rates. The author shares insights from conversations with journalism students at Kent State University, who express a lack of urgency to marry, prioritizing personal success and happiness over traditional marital expectations. They view marriage as a choice rather than a necessity, with some preferring to travel or focus on career goals instead of spending money on weddings. The passage highlights the increasing rates of divorce and remarriage in the U.S., with a significant portion of adults having been married more than once. It also notes that many millennials prefer financially stable partners and are wary of taking on debt. The author reflects on cultural differences, citing Scandinavian countries where cohabitation without marriage is common and often preferred due to the lack of economic or legal benefits from marriage. The passage concludes by questioning whether a society without marriage would be as well-off, acknowledging that while marriage can be about love, it also requires being good partners, and sometimes love alone is not enough. The author shares a personal anecdote about deciding to marry based on love and practicality, despite initial reservations."
12060,"The passage describes the recapture of Tikrit, Iraq, by Iraqi forces and Shiite militiamen from ISIS. Despite ISIS's departure, concerns remain due to potential booby traps and the cautious approach of Iraqi troops entering buildings. The city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, saw fierce fighting, including the destruction of a truck with ISIS fighters. The presence of explosives and the potential for sectarian reprisals by Shiite militias against the Sunni population are highlighted as significant concerns. The liberation of Tikrit is seen as a major victory for the Iraqi government, with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi claiming the city and planning further operations. The involvement of Iranian-backed Shiite militias marks a notable development, and the success in Tikrit sets the stage for future efforts to retake Mosul. The operation was supported by U.S.-led airstrikes targeting ISIS bases. The passage also notes the brutality of ISIS's rule in Tikrit, including the massacre of air force cadets and the destruction of historical sites."
12068,"The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called for a 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen, emphasizing the urgent need for medical attention for those wounded in recent airstrikes and ground fighting. The call was made before a U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the conflict, where Shiite rebels are fighting against external Arab air forces and supporters of Yemen's displaced Sunni president. The ICRC highlighted the critical situation in Aden, where food, water, medical supplies, and personnel are desperately needed to prevent further deaths. Robert Mardini, ICRC's head of operations in the Near and Middle East, stressed that the wounded need immediate care to survive. Marie-Claire Feghali, an ICRC spokeswoman, noted the scarcity of food, water, and fuel, and the urgent need for medical supplies.

In Sanaa, residents experienced intense Saudi airstrikes targeting military facilities. At the Security Council, Russia proposed a draft resolution to halt airstrikes by a Saudi-led coalition, but it lacked calls for the Houthis to cease fighting and for political talks. Yemen has been in turmoil since Houthi rebels, a marginalized Shiite group, ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi in January. Hadi fled to Saudi Arabia after being forced from Aden by the Houthis and their allies. The conflict has resulted in at least 519 deaths and 1,700 injuries over two weeks, with tens of thousands fleeing to Somalia and Djibouti. In Aden, recent fighting killed 58 people and injured 200. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) controls parts of eastern Yemen, adding complexity to the conflict. Additionally, photos circulated showing al Qaeda leader Khaled Batarfi, freed by militants, in a presidential residence. The French military evacuated 44 people from the eastern port city of Balhaf."
12073,"A New York Police Department detective, Patrick Cherry, apologized for an angry altercation with an Uber driver that was caught on video and went viral. Cherry, who has a top-secret security clearance and is part of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force, faces potential suspension, reassignment, or loss of clearance. The incident began when the Uber driver gestured for Cherry to use his blinker while parking. The video shows Cherry yelling at the driver, mocking his accent, and using expletives. Police Commissioner William Bratton placed Cherry on modified assignment pending an investigation, emphasizing that such behavior is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the police force. Cherry apologized to the commissioner and acknowledged his actions set back community relations. Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned the use of discriminatory language by public servants. Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, defended Cherry as a person of good character, noting that the incident should not define him. The NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating, and the Civilian Complaint Review Board is also involved, with potential disciplinary actions pending. Uber expressed support for the driver and is providing assistance."
13806,"In ""Big Brother 25,"" Cameron Hardin's third week as Head of Household (HOH) ended, and he nominated Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes for eviction. Cameron won the Power of Veto, keeping the nominations unchanged. During the October 5 episode, Mecole Hayes was evicted by a unanimous 7-0 vote, with Mecole urging the house to target Cory and America next. Following the eviction, a new HOH competition took place, based on Instagram-like photos. Bowie Jane and Felicia tied with perfect scores, but Bowie Jane won the tie-breaker question and became the new HOH for Week 10. She will host the upcoming Nomination Ceremony. Additionally, Cirie Fields set a Big Brother record, and there are plans for an all-winners season of Big Brother and the release of the ""Traitors 2"" cast list. The show airs on CBS."
13814,"In 2024, Social Security benefits will increase by 3.2% due to the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), announced by the Social Security Administration on October 12, 2023. This increase will affect over 66 million retirees, raising their average monthly benefits by more than $50 starting in January 2024. The COLA aims to help retirees manage rising living expenses and is tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. Additionally, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax will rise to $168,600 in 2024, up from $160,200 in 2023. Beneficiaries will receive notices of the increase in early December and can view their COLA notice online if they have a My Social Security account. The Senior Citizens League estimated this 3.2% increase, which would raise the average monthly retiree benefit of $1,790 by $57.30."
13815,"Tonee Turner, a 22-year-old artist from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, went missing on December 30, 2019. Her family has been actively searching for her since then, distributing flyers and going door-to-door. The last confirmed sighting of Tonee was at Dobra Tea, a local tea room. She was last in contact with her sister around 6:00 p.m. on the day she disappeared. Tonee worked as a metal fabricator at Studebaker Metals and taught ceramics part-time at the Braddock Carnegie Library, which is close to Dobra Tea.

Her belongings, including her purse, mobile phone, wallet, and keys, were found near a bridge, suggesting she may have traveled on Interstate 80 near Homestead, Pennsylvania. Tonee is described as 5 feet 3 inches tall, weighing 130 pounds, with black or dark brown chin-length hair, brown eyes, and multiple piercings. She has a spiral tattoo on her left shoulder and was last seen wearing a black zip-up jacket, a gray shirt with ""Habla Espanol"" written on the back, gray cargo pants, and possibly a black head wrap. The Pittsburgh Police are investigating the case, and anyone with information is urged to contact them at 412-323-7800. The case number is 19-264396."
13816,"The passage provides an assessment of Xanax's effectiveness in treating anxiety, aiming to separate fact from fiction. Xanax, or alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine that enhances the effects of GABA in the brain, leading to a calming effect and reducing anxiety. It is known for its rapid onset, making it useful for short-term relief of acute anxiety episodes. However, the development of tolerance is a significant concern, as it can lead to dependence and withdrawal symptoms. For long-term anxiety management, alternatives like therapy, lifestyle changes, or other medications may be more sustainable. The passage emphasizes the importance of using Xanax cautiously and under professional guidance, advocating for a holistic approach to anxiety treatment that includes various strategies. It concludes by highlighting the necessity of professional advice in managing anxiety effectively."
13823,"The Pentagon has confirmed the deployment of U.S. Army troops from Fort Cavazos in Killeen and Fort Bliss in El Paso to the Middle East. These troops are part of a group of 900 U.S. soldiers sent to protect U.S. forces from drone and rocket attacks, following at least 12 attacks in Iraq and four in Syria over the past week. The soldiers from Fort Bliss will primarily man a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) System, which intercepts ballistic missiles, and will also serve as air defense headquarters elements alongside soldiers from Fort Cavazos. Additional troops from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Fort Liberty, North Carolina, will join the deployment. The Pentagon has stated that these forces are not being sent to Israel and are intended to support regional deterrence and enhance U.S. force protection. The deployment follows incidents where 21 U.S. forces suffered minor injuries, mostly traumatic brain injuries."
13827,"In ""Big Brother 25,"" the houseguests are focused on removing Cameron Hardin, who is seen as a strong competitor. Bowie Jane, the current Head of Household, is under pressure to backdoor Cameron. However, she is hesitant and has instead nominated Felica Cannon and Cirie Fields, who both pose threats to her game. Cameron suggests that Cory Wurtrnberger, whom he views as a bigger threat, should be the next to leave. Cory has approached Bowie about backdooring Cameron, but she is not interested in nominating him as a replacement. The Power of Veto competition, hosted by Cory, involves Bowie, Felica, Cirie, Jag, Matt, and America. If Bowie, Jag, or Matt wins the Veto, the nominations remain unchanged. If America, Cirie, or Felica wins, Bowie must name a replacement nominee, potentially targeting Cory. The outcome of the Veto competition, held on Saturday, will determine if Bowie takes action against Cory or Cameron. The show airs on CBS and streams on Paramount Plus."
13829,"In ""Big Brother 25,"" Cameron Hardin was evicted in Week 10 after being unanimously targeted by the house due to his frequent challenge wins and difficulty connecting with other players. Felicia Cannon notably accused him of having an ""evil spirit."" Following his eviction, Jag Bains became the Secret Head of Household (HOH) by winning a BB Comics challenge and secretly nominated Blue Kim and Felicia for eviction, leading to their frustration. Felicia expressed regret over Cameron's eviction, appreciating his honesty, while Blue regretted not believing Cameron's warning about being targeted next. In Week 11, a Double Veto will significantly impact the game, with Blue needing to save herself after trash-talking Cameron. The show airs on CBS, and Michael Bruner from ""Big Brother 24"" recently got married. Cameron Hardin discussed his thoughts on the game in an exit interview."
13834,"In ""Big Brother 25,"" the Power of Veto for Week 10 was won by Jag Bains. The Veto will be used at the upcoming Veto Meeting. Bowie Jane became the Head of Household for the first time, with advice from Cameron Hardin. She nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields for eviction, citing past grievances. During the OTEV challenge, Felicia accused Bowie Jane of throwing the competition, while Cirie claimed America Lopez did the same. Jag won the Power of Veto, and there is a plan for him to use it to replace Cameron Hardin as the nominee, making Cameron the first jury member of the season. The Veto Meeting is set for October 9, where Bowie Jane may backdoor Cameron, despite his alliance with her. The situation is tense, with various houseguests spreading stories about Cameron. The episodes leading up to the Veto Meeting are expected to be intriguing. Additionally, Peacock released the cast list for ""The Traitors"" Season 2, featuring people from ""Survivor,"" ""The Bachelor,"" and ""Big Brother."" ""Big Brother 25"" airs on CBS."
13840,"New York House Republicans, led by Representative Anthony D'Esposito and supported by fellow Republicans Nick LaLota, Marc Molinaro, and Mike Lawler, have initiated a privileged motion to expel George Santos from Congress. This action follows the filing of 23 new federal criminal charges against Santos, including unauthorized use of campaign contributors' credit cards and identity theft. Additionally, Santos has been accused of fabricating his resume for the 2022 election. The motion argues that Santos is unfit to serve his constituents. A vote on his expulsion is scheduled for the upcoming legislative session. Despite this, Santos has stated he will not resign. His removal may be hindered by the narrow Republican majority in Congress (221 to 212), as expelling him requires 290 votes. Alternatives to expulsion include tabling the measure or referring it to a committee. Even if all Democrats support the motion, 78 Republicans would need to vote against their leadership's preference to maintain seats. The controversy surrounding Santos is expected to persist regardless of the vote's outcome."
13842,"The passage discusses changes to the ""sit-out"" rules on the reality show ""Survivor,"" as explained by host Jeff Probst. Previously, castaways could not sit out consecutive challenges within a single cycle, but this rule reset at Tribal Council. The game was shortened to 26 days, leading to less time for rewards and frequent sit-outs. To address this, a new rule was implemented: castaways cannot sit out back-to-back challenges. This change was prompted by Claire Rafson from ""Survivor 44,"" who sat out three consecutive Immunity Challenges, causing fan and cast member backlash. The new rule aims to simplify the game and make it easier for fans to understand. Additionally, the passage mentions new episode formats, social media reactions to cast members, and the availability of episodes on Paramount+. ""Survivor"" airs on Wednesdays at 8/7c on CBS."
13843,"In the upcoming episodes of ""The Young and the Restless,"" Nick Newman pressures Sally Spectra to choose between him and Adam Newman. The CBS promo shows Nick confronting Adam, demanding Sally make a choice. Nick, aware of Sally's unresolved feelings for Adam, breaks up with her to encourage her to sort out her emotions. Sally is torn between her love for Nick and her connection with Adam, and she initially refuses to choose, considering leaving both to avoid taking a stand. Despite this, Sally and Adam become intimate, which strengthens her bond with Adam but does not diminish her feelings for Nick. Both brothers promise Sally security and support, and Nick confronts Adam to prevent him from pursuing Sally. A physical altercation ensues between the brothers, which Sally breaks up. Nick insists Sally make a decision, and the spoilers hint that her choice will surprise viewers. The show airs weekdays on CBS and streams on Paramount Plus."
13846,"A team of scientists at Rice University has received $45 million to develop a novel implant-based cancer treatment system called HAMMR. This system aims to enhance immunotherapy outcomes by continuously monitoring cancer and adjusting drug doses in real-time. The three-inch implant will deliver immunotherapy drugs in a closed-loop system and communicate wirelessly, potentially with a smartphone. Researchers suggest the implant could eradicate cancer in as little as 60 days and is intended for short-term use. Current diagnostic tools provide limited snapshots of cancer, reducing therapy effectiveness. The HAMMR system offers real-time tumor data to guide more effective treatments. The first clinical trial will focus on recurrent ovarian cancer, with human trials expected in five years. This technology could treat a broad range of peritoneal cancers, offering more personalized and efficient treatments."
13848,"The Miami Dolphins, following a controversial loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, are considering potential trades as the NFL trade deadline approaches. Despite an improved defense, the Dolphins still have needs, particularly along the offensive line and in the defensive line's ability to generate pressure. Chase Young, a defensive end for the Washington Commanders, is a potential trade target. Although not an obvious need, Young's addition could significantly enhance the Dolphins' defensive line, which has struggled with consistent pressure. Emmanuel Ogbah and Christian Wilkins have underperformed, and Young, with 5 sacks this season, would be a substantial upgrade. However, acquiring Young would require a long-term contract extension, posing cap challenges for Miami. Despite these challenges, the Dolphins have previously committed to significant contracts, such as with Jonathan Taylor. Adding Young to a defensive line that includes Wilkins, Zach Sieler, Jaelen Phillips, and Bradley Chubb could strengthen their playoff push by improving their sack numbers and overall defensive performance."
13850,"In a significant development in a 1988 cold case, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) identified the human remains found in a Jenkins County dumpster as Chong Un Kim, a 26-year-old immigrant from Korea who lived in Hinesville, Georgia. The remains, discovered on February 14, 1988, were wrapped in plastic and duct tape inside a nylon suitcase. The cause of death was asphyxiation, and the victim had been deceased for four to seven days. Initial identification efforts, including fingerprint and dental record comparisons, were unsuccessful. A forensic artist's sketch was also shared publicly.

Over the years, DNA technology evolved, but previous attempts to generate a DNA profile for CODIS were unsuccessful. In 2023, the GBI collaborated with Othram, Inc., using advanced DNA analysis and genealogical searches to identify Kim. The breakthrough was funded by ""Project Justice,"" and Kim's family was notified in October 2023. The GBI is now seeking information from anyone who knew Kim or has relevant details, offering multiple ways to submit tips."

The Biden administration has included Venezuelan nationals who entered the U.S. by July 31 in the pool eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), potentially speeding up work permit processes for asylum seekers in New York City. USCIS, the federal agency responsible, is taking steps to expedite work permit applications, including education sessions, alerts about eligibility, and mobile biometric services. USCIS aims to complete applications within a 30-day average.

13874,"The passage discusses China's military expansion, highlighting the launch of its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines. According to the Pentagon, these submarines enhance China's ability to conduct long-range precision strikes against land targets using land-attack cruise missiles, thereby boosting its power projection capabilities. The development is reminiscent of Cold War-era Soviet strategies aimed at targeting U.S. aircraft carriers. The timing of these advancements is significant, given concerns about potential Chinese actions towards Taiwan amidst global conflicts involving the U.S., Russia, Ukraine, Israel, and Hamas. The Pentagon report also raises concerns about China's nuclear capabilities, projecting an increase to nearly 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030 and the construction of new ICBM silos. Additionally, China may be developing conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems. With the Chinese navy already the largest in the world, it is expected to grow to 435 ships and submarines by 2030. The passage suggests that China's military activities and rhetoric towards Taiwan should be taken seriously."

13895,"Illinois Senate President Don Harmon is involved in a controversy over his support for legislation that could provide significant property tax breaks to nursing homes in Cook County. This controversy is fueled by the revelation that Harmon has received nearly $2 million in campaign contributions from the Health Care Council of Illinois, a trade group representing nursing homes, with over $700,000 in the past year. The legislation, which Harmon backed, would reclassify nursing homes as residential property, reducing their property taxes. However, Governor J.B. Pritzker vetoed this provision, arguing it would unfairly shift the financial burden to suburban homeowners and small businesses. The Health Care Council and nursing homes are now seeking legislative support to override the veto, with indications of strong support from Harmon's Senate chief of staff, Jacob Butcher. Harmon has not commented on the contributions or his stance on the legislation, while his spokesman emphasized that decisions are made in the public's best interest. Ron Nunziato from the Health Care Council defended Harmon, denying any direct link between the contributions and his legislative position."

13503,"The passage describes a surprising display of the Northern Lights across the Midwest and Northern Plains on the night of October 20th and early morning of October 21st, 2023, following a weak Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) that hit Earth. Despite its weak nature, the CME resulted in visible auroras in states such as Minnesota, Michigan, southern Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Omaha, Nebraska. This event was unexpected because the CME had slower solar wind speeds and lacked the typical data spikes that aurora hunters rely on for predictions. Instead, subtle indicators like a gap in satellite data, a slight increase in solar winds, and a gradual decrease in negative Bz values suggested the potential for auroras. Charlie Bourdo identified these signs hours before the event.

Prior to the escalation, the United Nations noted that most of Yemen's 25 million people required humanitarian assistance."
11396,"Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's sex abuse scandal. Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was convicted in 2012 for failing to report suspected child abuse. He was put on probation but not jailed or fined. The case involved Shawn Ratigan, a priest who pleaded guilty to child pornography charges, and church officials delayed reporting the abuse. Despite his conviction, Finn remained bishop until his resignation. The diocese will be temporarily led by Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann. The resignation is seen as a step toward addressing accountability, but critics call for more explicit statements from Pope Francis to signal a shift in handling such cases. The Vatican's announcement was brief, and some advocate for a public statement confirming the removal was due to prioritizing child safety."
11416,"Tristan da Cunha, a volcanic archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean, is the most isolated human settlement on earth, with a population of just under 270 people. As it approaches its 200th anniversary, the settlement is seeking global architectural and design expertise to enhance its infrastructure and achieve self-sustainability. In collaboration with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), an international competition is being held to address aging infrastructure and improve energy efficiency. The island's homes and public buildings, primarily small bungalows made from concrete and volcanic rock, lack insulation and renewable energy systems. The competition encourages proposals for renewable energy, modern housing, and cost-effective agrarian systems. Contestants must consider logistical challenges, such as transporting materials to the island. Tristan da Cunha consists of four islands, with Tristan being the only inhabited one. The island's economy relies on lobster fishing, tourism, and the sale of stamps, coins, and handicrafts. Despite being self-sufficient in many areas, the islanders aim to reduce fossil fuel reliance and imports. Recent infrastructure updates include new water, electrical, and waste water systems. The competition deadline for initial ideas is mid-June, with finalists to be announced in June 2016. Funding for the project may require grants from the UK and EU. The focus is on cost-effective, practical solutions for energy efficiency and modernizing government structures."
11428,"The passage covers several political stories:

1. **Obama's Foreign Policy and Cuba**: President Obama's Iran diplomacy has sparked criticism from conservatives. He is set to attend a regional summit in Panama, where a potential meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro is anticipated. This would be the first such meeting in decades, but the White House is weighing whether it would advance progress or prematurely reward the Castros.

2. **Hillary Clinton's Campaign Launch**: Hillary Clinton has leased headquarters in Brooklyn and is preparing to officially launch her presidential campaign. The campaign will focus on reintroducing her, emphasizing her childhood, work on children's issues, and her time as Arkansas's first lady. The campaign aims to highlight her personal story and has assembled a large, experienced staff for national and state roles, planning smaller, personal interaction events.

3. **Robert Menendez Indictment**: The corruption indictment against Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey includes allegations of luxury hotel stays and soliciting funds for a super PAC, which may lead to increased scrutiny of similar practices by other lawmakers.

4. **GOP Presidential Candidates**: By the following Monday, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio will be official GOP presidential candidates. Pressure is mounting on GOP operatives to choose sides, with notable figures like Matt Maroney and Tony Fabrizio aligning with Chris Christie and Rand Paul, respectively. Other candidates, including John Kasich and Donald Trump, are also seeking support."
11430,"Jake Tapper has been promoted to anchor CNN's Sunday morning political interview program ""State of the Union,"" effective in June. He will continue as CNN's chief Washington correspondent and anchor of the weekday afternoon newscast ""The Lead."" Tapper, recognized as a political authority, previously received positive reviews as the interim anchor of ABC's ""This Week"" in 2010.

11800,"The passage details the tragic death of Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old American aid worker, who was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda in Pakistan. Weinstein had been held captive since 2011 after being abducted from his home in Lahore by gunmen posing as neighbors. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri claimed Weinstein's capture, demanding the U.S. end airstrikes in Pakistan. Despite U.S. officials calling for his release, they refused to negotiate with al Qaeda. Weinstein, a development expert and contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development, was known for his dedication to helping people in Pakistan. His family expressed deep disappointment with the U.S. and Pakistani governments for not securing his release. U.S. President Barack Obama praised Weinstein's lifelong dedication to service, while his wife criticized the inconsistent efforts by U.S. officials and the lack of action by Pakistani authorities. Another hostage, Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto, was also killed in the same operation. Weinstein's deteriorating health and his family's hopes for a prisoner swap were highlighted, but no such exchange occurred. His wife emphasized that his captors were ultimately responsible for his death."
11803,"South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo offered his resignation amid a political scandal involving allegations of corruption linked to the suicide of tycoon Sung Woan-jong, who left a note implicating top officials, including those associated with President Park Geun-hye. Lee will remain in his position until President Park accepts his resignation and has temporarily transferred his duties as chair of Cabinet meetings to the deputy prime minister. President Park, who is currently in Peru, described the resignation as ""regrettable"" and emphasized the seriousness of the corruption allegations, vowing to address them as part of political reform. Lee has denied the allegations and expressed willingness to face investigation. A special prosecutor's team has been established to investigate the case, which involves Lee and seven other politicians. President Park is expected to return to South Korea on April 27."
11871,"The passage discusses the closure of Corinthian Colleges Inc., a for-profit college known for its predatory practices, which include offering dubious degrees, saddling students with high debt, and heavily relying on federal student aid. The closure follows the U.S. Department of Education's restriction of Corinthian's access to federal student aid. The passage highlights the broader issue of for-profit colleges, which enroll about 1.3 million students and are criticized for their high student loan default rates and aggressive recruitment tactics. Despite their questionable practices, these colleges receive significant federal funding. The passage notes that for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of college students but account for nearly half of all student loan defaults. It also mentions the financial and employment struggles faced by graduates of these institutions, with some earning less than high school dropouts. The cost of for-profit education is reportedly higher than public colleges. The passage calls for the closure of remaining for-profit colleges and the forgiveness of debts for affected students, emphasizing the need to protect the integrity of college degrees. It also references past investigations and penalties against for-profit colleges for unethical practices. The closure of Corinthian is seen as a step towards addressing the issues with for-profit education."
11884,"The passage describes the transformation of Kabul, Afghanistan, following the end of America's longest war. The city has grown in population but shrunk in economic activity, with many areas now deserted. Former employees who spoke English and were once valued by NATO are now unemployed and blacklisted, fearing reprisals and living in precarious conditions. The U.S. Embassy and NATO declined to comment on these issues.

Kabul's population has increased significantly, partly due to people fleeing violence in the provinces. Neighborhoods that were once occupied by foreigners are now empty, and areas like Chicken Street, once bustling with activity, are deserted. The infrastructure built during the war, including heavy machinery and supply chains, now sits idle. Many truck drivers who supported military operations are left with expensive vehicles that have little value.

Despite the uncertainty, wedding palaces continue to thrive, symbolizing a commitment to the future. The city's lights, a symbol of progress, are maintained by costly diesel power stations, raising questions about their sustainability as American troops prepare to leave. The passage highlights the uneasy legacy of the war and the challenges faced by those left behind."
11885,"The passage discusses a Consumer Reports study on the availability of award tickets across the five largest U.S. airlines, based on 70 million passenger trips over two years. Southwest Airlines was the top performer, offering 11.9 million award tickets, which constituted 11.5% of its total seats. This success is attributed to its policy of making every seat an award seat, having no blackout dates, non-expiring points, and a wide route map. Southwest also does not charge fees for last-minute bookings or cancellations. In contrast, JetBlue offered the fewest award tickets, with 892,000 one-way tickets, or 4.5% of its total seats, partly because it operates in fewer markets and customers fly less frequently. Delta, United, and American Airlines ranked second, third, and fourth, respectively, in terms of award seat availability. The study highlights that award tickets are not free, as the cost of miles is embedded in purchases, and airlines profit from unused miles. It advises consumers to book award travel carefully to ensure value for their miles. Additionally, while award-seat availability is significant, customer satisfaction is also crucial, with Southwest having the highest score. Southwest does not charge fees, unlike other airlines that impose various charges."
11890,"James Holmes, a former doctoral student in neuroscience, carried out one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history at a Colorado cinema during a midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in June 2012. Holmes, dressed in body armor and resembling the Joker, killed 12 people and injured or maimed 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. He is accused of using an AR-15 rifle and other weapons, and he wore a gas mask. Holmes claims he was insane at the time, pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors seek the death penalty, while Holmes admits to the shootings but asserts he was experiencing a psychotic episode. His defense argues he suffers from severe mental illness, supported by evidence of his mental health struggles, including threats made prior to the shooting. Holmes, who was a top student and had a promising academic career, had been denied access to his university after making threats. His family has pleaded for his life to be spared, advocating for his commitment to a mental institution if found not guilty by reason of insanity. The trial, involving 165 charges, is set to begin with a jury of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. Holmes' actions have sparked discussions on media coverage of mass shooters, with victims' families urging against granting them notoriety."
11891,"Prosperity gospel pastor Creflo Dollar addressed critics of his campaign to purchase a Gulfstream G650 jet, which he sought to fund by asking for $300 from 200,000 people worldwide. In a YouTube video, Dollar claimed that the devil was trying to discredit him and emphasized that he never directly asked his congregation for money for the jet. He explained that due to two accidents involving his 31-year-old Gulfstream G-1159A, he and his staff had been flying commercially. Dollar defended the need for a new jet by highlighting the ministry's activities and dismissing critics' questions about the necessity of an airplane for a preacher. The campaign faced criticism on social media and in media reports after a video soliciting donations was posted on the ministry's website, which has since been removed, though donations can still be made through the church's gift page. The Gulfstream G650, valued at $65 million, offers luxury and advanced technology, and the campaign was open to contributions from members, partners, and supporters. Dollar cited two incidents with his old plane, including a runway skid in London, as reasons for seeking a new aircraft. The prosperity gospel theology, which promises wealth and health to those who tithe, underpins the ministry's approach. Attempts to contact Dollar's ministry for further comment were unsuccessful."
