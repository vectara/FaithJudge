14-0,"The passage describes a violent attack on the Sardar Daud hospital in Afghanistan, where militants armed with guns and grenades entered after detonating explosives at the gate. The attackers, claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, opened fire on staff and patients. Commandos neutralized all four attackers after several hours of combat. The Taliban denied involvement. Over 50 people were wounded, according to the defense ministry. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, emphasizing the sanctity of hospitals. The assault began at 09:00 local time and marked a shift in IS tactics, as it was the first direct engagement with security forces in the capital. Previously, IS targeted civilian gatherings and the Supreme Court. The attack suggests IS has increased resources and training, potentially leading to more assaults. IS has been active in Afghanistan since 2015, primarily in the east, but has struggled to expand its influence. The government claims to have removed IS from several bases but not from mountainous areas. The operation concluded with the death of all attackers, as confirmed by the interior ministry. The attack is part of a series of IS activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, including previous attacks in Kabul and other regions. The Taliban also continues its own attacks, having initiated a Spring offensive."

14-2,"Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, announced a decision to extend his term by one year, surprising many who expected him to either stay until 2021 or leave in 2018 as originally planned. This decision was influenced by personal reasons, particularly his family's educational needs in Canada. Carney's daughters were nearing the completion of their A-levels and GCSEs in 2018, prompting his choice to return home. Despite speculation about political pressure or disillusionment with the UK's economic outlook post-Brexit, Carney emphasized that his decision was personal and not influenced by government policy or criticism of the Bank's economic forecasts. He acknowledged the importance of his role and his commitment to it, but felt unable to extend beyond 2019 due to his family's plans. Theresa May, the Prime Minister, respected his decision, and Carney believed that leaving in 2019 would allow a new Governor to handle the UK's economic future post-Brexit."

15-3,"The passage discusses a study on alcohol use in the United States, highlighting an increase in heavy and binge drinking from 2005 to 2012. Heavy drinking rose by 17.2%, largely due to increased rates among women, as social norms have evolved. The study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington and published in the American Journal of Public Health, defines heavy drinking as exceeding one drink per day for women and two for men over the past month, and binge drinking as four or more drinks for women and five for men on a single occasion at least once in the past month.

The increase in binge drinking is particularly notable among women, with rates rising by nearly 36% in Santa Clara County, California, compared to 23% for men. Nationally, women's binge drinking rates increased more than seven times that of men. Despite these increases, the overall percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained stable.

In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers, and 18% were binge drinkers. The study also notes regional variations, with Madison County, Idaho, having the lowest binge drinking rate at 6%, and Menominee, Wisconsin, the highest at 36%. Excessive drinking is linked to approximately 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010 and costs over $220 billion annually.

Public health experts attribute the rise in excessive drinking to changing social norms, economic factors, and increased alcohol advertising. The influx of affluent professionals in certain areas, such as the Bay Area, and the weakening of alcohol control policies may also contribute to higher drinking rates. The study analyzed data from about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System."

16-0,"The passage discusses the anticipated fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, highlighting its potential financial and historical significance. It compares this event to past iconic boxing matches, particularly focusing on the rivalry between Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran. The first fight between Leonard and Duran in Montreal ended controversially with Duran winning by unanimous decision after a scoring error. In their rematch in New Orleans on November 25, 1980, Leonard used his speed and movement to frustrate Duran, who famously quit in the eighth round, saying ""no mas."" This moment shocked the world and damaged Duran's reputation, leading to a three-year period of rebuilding. Duran eventually restored his status by winning the world light-middleweight title in 1983. Leonard and Duran fought a third time in 1989, with Leonard winning by points. Leonard considered making Duran quit as a greater achievement than a knockout. The passage also references other historic boxing events and figures, such as the ""golden age of boxing"" and other notable fights."
16-1,"Rory McIlroy believes it is ""unthinkable"" that he will not win the Masters at some point to complete the career grand slam. He considers his final-round collapse at Augusta National in 2011 as the most important day of his career, as it taught him valuable lessons about his game. McIlroy aims to become the sixth player to win all four major titles, joining the ranks of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods.

The discovery is significant for scientists, as the species was only described in 2003 and is known to inhabit tropical and subtropical waters, typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. The whale has a sleek body and unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass will be buried, with plans to recover the skeleton for further study and potential museum display."

10-0,"The ""black box"" of the Su-24 jet was opened in Moscow in the presence of journalists and diplomats. Nikolai Primak, head of the Russian investigation, noted that flight information was missing, which could help determine the jet's location when it was shot down. The analysis is expected next week. The incident worsened relations between Russia and Turkey, leading Moscow to impose sanctions. Turkey claims the jet, part of Russia's air contingent in Syria, ignored warnings to leave its airspace, while Russia asserts it was downed within Syrian airspace. President Vladimir Putin criticized Turkey's government, accusing it of subservience to the US and ""creeping Islamisation."" The Su-24 was shot down by Turkish F-16s on November 24, resulting in the death of one crew member and the rescue of another. Russia also lost a marine and a helicopter during a rescue attempt. Russia demands an apology from Turkey and has imposed sanctions, including a ban on package holidays, potentially costing Turkey billions."

Davina denied the charge and is set to be sentenced on March 4. Judge Ian Pearson remanded her into custody, indicating she would likely be held in a male prison in Winchester due to concerns about her risk to herself and potential failure to attend court.

The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Council made this decision, bypassing the usual bidding process due to a ""unique strategic opportunity"" to host the event in the USA for the first time. Although Eugene failed to secure the 2019 event, which went to Doha, Qatar, a recent presentation convinced the IAAF of Eugene's capability to host the championships. IAAF President Lamine Diack highlighted the strategic decision as a chance to leverage support from public authorities, the private sector, the national Olympic committee, NBC, and an enthusiastic public. This decision mirrors the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, which was also awarded without a bidding process.

Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, was barely showing last week but is now a mother. In the upcoming episode, Ross Poldark, portrayed by Aidan Turner, will be seen lovingly gazing at his new baby daughter. Despite Ross's marriage to Demelza being initially out of duty, his affection for her is evident. However, the timeline of the pregnancy is criticized for its rapid progression, as Demelza is shown to be eight months pregnant at the start of the new episode, only to give birth shortly after, with the last month of her pregnancy passing quickly.

Fans have commented on social media about the unrealistic speed of pregnancies in the show."

Elizabeth Mitchell from the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome emphasizes that FAS is a significant, under-diagnosed problem. The passage also shares the story of Niamh Brown, a teenager with FAS, who requires extensive support and will never live independently. Other medical issues linked to prenatal alcohol exposure include liver, kidney, and heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy.

They are set to host Iceland at Falkirk Stadium, with a victory likely securing their place in the finals. The team is determined to avoid the disappointment of past play-off losses for Euro 2013 and the World Cup.
