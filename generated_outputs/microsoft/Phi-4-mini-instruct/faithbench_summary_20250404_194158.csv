14-0,"Militants armed with guns and grenades, claiming allegiance to the Islamic State (IS), attacked a hospital in Afghanistan, killing four attackers after a prolonged battle on the hospital roof. The Taliban denied involvement, while the IS claimed the attack. Over 50 people were wounded, and the incident is seen as a shift in IS's approach, as they now directly engage with security forces in the capital, previously targeting civilian gatherings. The attack, which began at 09:00 local time, marks a change in IS's strategy, suggesting they have gained resources and military training to expand their attacks. The government has claimed to have removed IS militants from several bases but has not yet dislodged them from mountainous areas they control. The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared images of the attack and the dead attackers. The Taliban has also been active in the region, carrying out attacks, including a recent suicide attack in Kabul."

15-3,"A major study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, published in the American Journal of Public Health, found that heavy drinking and binge drinking among Americans increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, with a significant rise in women's drinking habits. The CDC defines heavy drinking as more than one drink per day for women and two for men, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men in a single occasion. The study, which tracked adult drinking patterns at the county level, found that 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers in 2012. The increase in binge drinking is attributed to changing social norms, economic factors, and a lack of increased alcohol taxes. Public health experts suggest that cultural shifts, the influx of wealthy professionals, and increased alcohol advertising have contributed to the rise in excessive drinking. The study analyzed data from about 3.7 million Americans aged 21 and older."
