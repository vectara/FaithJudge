15601,"The passage discusses a flawed article by Rolling Stone about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia, which was criticized for failures in reporting, editing, and fact-checking. The magazine apologized for the errors. The discussion then turns to the potential for defamation lawsuits by UVA or the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. Key points include:

- The article is considered false and defamatory, which are necessary elements for a libel case.
- UVA, as a public university, cannot sue for defamation.
- Fraternities, as groups, generally cannot sue for defamation unless the defamatory statement is about a small group and easily imputed to all members.
- Phi Kappa Psi might argue it fits the ""small group"" exception, but Rolling Stone's lawyers could counter that the group is too large and fluid.
- Other fraternities on campus would likely face more challenges in bringing a lawsuit.
- Successful defamation cases typically require showing financial harm, making this case potentially rare and complex."

He quoted a document from Pope John Paul II that referred to the event as ""the first genocide of the 20th century.""
