15599,"Blue Bell ice cream temporarily shut down its Broken Arrow, Oklahoma plant and recalled certain products after listeria contamination was discovered in ice cream originating from that facility. Public health officials warned consumers against specific 3-ounce servings from the Broken Arrow plant. Listeria found in a Kansas hospital's ice cream and at the plant genetically matched each other, though not the listeria from Kansas patients. However, in a separate Texas outbreak, patient listeria samples matched those from Blue Bell cups. The CDC is investigating the link between these illnesses and Blue Bell products. Five people were infected and three died in Kansas, potentially linked to Blue Bell. This marks Blue Bell's first product recall in its 108-year history. Listeriosis is a serious infection, primarily affecting vulnerable populations."
15601,"An outside review by Columbia Journalism School professors concluded that a ""deeply flawed article"" by Rolling Stone about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia resulted from ""institutional failure"" in reporting, editing, supervision, and fact-checking. Rolling Stone's managing editor, Will Dana, apologized for the story. The passage then explores potential defamation lawsuits. The University of Virginia, as a governmental entity, cannot sue for defamation. While groups generally cannot sue unless statements are ""of or concerning"" them, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity might argue it falls under a ""small group"" exception where defamation is easily imputed to all members, though Rolling Stone could counter that the group is too large. Other fraternities would likely face greater difficulty. Although defamation cases often require proof of financial harm and are rarely successful, the passage suggests that individual Phi Kappa Psi members could potentially succeed if they overcome preliminary hurdles and demonstrate damages."
15604,"The author, the first woman and person of color elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, expresses strong disapproval of Rand Paul's presidential campaign. She criticizes Paul for attempting to launch his campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting and civil rights legislation, supporting private business discrimination, and opposing protections for DREAMers and women's choices. The author argues that Paul's stated message of ""expanding the Republican Party"" is mere hype, as his policies contradict his claims of inclusion. She concludes that his views are outdated, outside the mainstream, and disqualify him from leading the country, advocating for more democracy and genuine commitment to minority communities."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau and Vili Fualaau, whose relationship began in 1996 when she was his 34-year-old teacher and he was her 13-year-old student, are still happily married and will celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. Their affair led to Letourneau serving over seven years in prison. Now 53 and 31 respectively, the couple, who are parents to two teen girls, will be featured in an exclusive ""20/20"" interview. In the interview, Mary Kay will discuss their marriage, her plans to teach again, and her intention to have her sex offender status lifted, while Vili will discuss his struggles with alcoholism and depression, and his belief that the system failed him as a minor."
15616,"Kanye West has settled a civil lawsuit with paparazzi photographer Daniel Ramos, who he assaulted in July 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport. During the incident, West tried to wrestle Ramos' camera from him. West had previously pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge for the scuffle, resulting in two years' probation, anger management, and community service.

Ramos, represented by lawyer Gloria Allred, filed the civil suit seeking damages, claiming West interfered with his right to pursue a lawful occupation. The case was settled to the satisfaction of both parties, with a key aspect of the undisclosed settlement being an apology from West to Ramos, followed by a handshake. Allred stated the case sent a message that celebrities are not above the law."
15617,"Blues legend B.B. King was hospitalized for dehydration, which was caused by his Type II diabetes. His daughter, Claudette King, confirmed he is now much better, has been released from the hospital, and is resting at home. King, 89, had a similar health issue last year, suffering from dehydration and exhaustion that led to a tour cancellation. A renowned musician, King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, has 30 Grammy nominations, and famously named his Gibson guitars Lucille."
15623,"Indiana Pacers player Chris Copeland was stabbed early Wednesday in New York City after leaving a nightclub, 1OAK. His companion, Katrine Saltara, was also stabbed, and another woman was slashed. The incident occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project, down the street from the club, not on 1OAK's property, though club staff assisted Copeland. A suspect was arrested, and charges are pending. Separately, Atlanta Hawks players Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct (Sefolosha also for resisting arrest) for pushing through a crowd at the scene, though police stated they were not involved in the stabbing itself. Copeland is in stable condition with knife wounds to his left elbow and abdomen."
15627,"Twenty years after her death, Tejano star Selena's family is creating ""Selena the One,"" a hologram-like digital embodiment of the singer. Developed by Nevada-based tech company Acrovirt LLC, this figure will be a ""walking, talking, singing and dancing digital embodiment"" of Selena, designed to allow new fans to experience her and continue her legacy. The project plans to release new songs and videos, collaborate with current artists, and aims to go on tour in 2018. Selena will be the first figure to use Acrovirt's technology and the first Latina to do so. An Indiegogo campaign, launching April 16, seeks to raise $500,000 to support the project."
15628,"Alaska Airlines Flight 448, en route from Seattle to Los Angeles, returned to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport shortly after takeoff due to unusual banging from the cargo hold. The noise came from a ramp agent, a contractor for Alaska Airlines, who had fallen asleep in the cargo hold. The cargo hold was pressurized and temperature-controlled, and the plane was only airborne for 14 minutes, so the agent was not in danger. Passengers also heard the pounding and yelling. After an emergency landing, the agent was taken to a hospital as a precaution, passed a drug test, and was discharged. Alaska Airlines is investigating the incident, and the flight, with 170 passengers and six crew members, later departed for Los Angeles."
15634,"Emy Afalava, a decorated veteran born in American Samoa (a U.S. territory), is denied U.S. citizenship despite the Fourteenth Amendment's declaration that persons born in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction are citizens. He and other American Samoans are pursuing a federal lawsuit to gain citizenship. The passage draws parallels to historical instances of citizenship denial based on race, such as the Dred Scott case (later overturned by the 14th Amendment) and the Isabel Gonzalez case involving Puerto Rico, where the Supreme Court avoided granting citizenship due to racial concerns. American Samoans are currently the only inhabitants of a U.S. island territory who have not been granted U.S. citizenship."
15638,"Faarrow, comprised of sisters Iman (25) and Siham (27) Hashi, are recording their debut Afro-pop album in Los Angeles. Born in Mogadishu, Somalia, they fled to Canada as refugees in 1991, where they developed a passion for music. Their sound is a fusion of pop with hip hop undertones and rhythmic African percussion, influenced by artists like Michael Jackson and the Spice Girls. They write and produce their own music, working with Elijah Kelley, and are signed to Warner Brothers Records.

Beyond music, the sisters are spokespersons for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), motivated by their family in the Dadaab refugee camp. They started a non-profit, held benefit concerts, and launched ""Wish Creatively"" (Women Internationally Selling Hope), a socially conscious brand selling jewelry to support women's projects in Kenya and Somalia. They aim to use their musical platform to inspire and help their home country. Their album is nearing completion, with most tracks mixed and ready for release."
15651,"Pope Francis faced a dilemma regarding the 1915 Armenian killings by Turks, which many historians and countries call a ""genocide"" but Turkey disputes. To commemorate the centennial, Francis referred to the event as ""the first genocide of the 20th century"" by quoting a 2001 document signed by Pope John Paul II. This approach maintained Vatican continuity, a key concern, while also considering Turkey's role as an ally against ISIS.

Despite the indirect phrasing, Turkey reacted strongly, recalling its Vatican ambassador and summoning the Vatican's ambassador, with its Foreign Minister calling the Pope's statement ""unacceptable."" The passage notes Francis's willingness to engage in geopolitics and his bluntness, contrasting with his usual sympathetic image, and his subsequent encouragement for priests to speak frankly."
15652,"National Park Week, hosted by the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation, runs from April 18 to April 26. During this week, the 128 national parks that typically charge a fee, including Yellowstone and Yosemite, will offer free admission on Saturday and Sunday. The event features various activities such as night-time astronomy parties, Revolutionary War programs, Earth Day parties, and Junior Ranger activities. More information about park sites and activities can be found at FindYourPark.com and www.nationalparkweek.org, and visitors are encouraged to share their experiences using #FindYourPark."
15661,"Two robotic probes were deployed into the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant to assess damage and collect data after a 2011 meltdown. The first probe, sent April 10, stalled after 10 meters due to a fallen object but collected data from 14 of 18 targeted locations before its cable was cut on April 12. The second probe, deployed April 15, captured images of a ""strange green glow"" and ""yellow discoloration,"" though the cause of both was unknown and the green glow was not visible from all angles. This second robot detected lower-than-expected radiation and temperature levels, indicating effective cooling, and collected all scheduled data. TEPCO considers this an ""unprecedented"" experiment and a ""great step forward"" for decommissioning, which is estimated to cost $50 billion and take years, as the site remains too dangerous for human entry due to extremely high radiation levels."
15665,"The passage describes the victim impact phase of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial, where the jury must decide his sentence after being found guilty of the Boston Marathon bombing. This phase features heartbreaking testimony from the families of the four people killed—Krystle Campbell, Lingzi Lu, Martin Richard, and Sean Collier—highlighting their lives and the pain of their loss. Survivors also testified about the horrific physical injuries and ongoing suffering caused by the bombs, such as Gillian Reny's severe leg injury and Celeste Corcoran's double amputation, detailing their experiences of the blast and subsequent challenges. Prosecutors presented Tsarnaev as unconcerned, unrepentant, and defiant, emphasizing his lack of remorse and his view of the victims as ""the enemy."""
15667,"The 50th Academy of Country Music Awards, held at the Dallas Cowboys stadium and hosted by Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan, was noted for being bigger than previous years, setting a Guinness World Record for the largest audience for a live TV awards show.

Highlights included Eric Church and Keith Urban's opening performance, Reba McEntire's strong vocals, Taylor Swift singing in the audience, Garth Brooks' salute to the U.S. military, and Andrea Swift's poignant appearance. Other notable moments were Christina Aguilera joining Rascal Flatts, Miranda Lambert's awards domination, Little Big Town performing ""Girl Crush,"" and Jason Aldean's powerful performance.

Conversely, the show's low points included a prolonged segment with Tony Romo, the excessive length of the broadcast, and the rushed presentation of some Milestone Awards. Steven Tyler's facial hair was also mentioned as a ""worst"" moment, as was Twitter's criticism of Taylor Swift for attending after her move to pop music."
15670,"Polish Prince Jan Zylinski challenged British politician Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), to a sword duel in London's Hyde Park. The challenge was issued via a YouTube video, with Zylinski expressing frustration over Farage's immigration policy and perceived discrimination against Poles in Britain. Farage, whose party advocates leaving the European Union to control borders and cut foreign aid, declined the sword duel. Zylinski also offered an alternative challenge: a verbal duel in a TV studio, but Farage did not comment on this. Zylinski further posted a video defending Poles, highlighting their contributions and work ethic in Britain."
15673,"Seven people, including Illinois State University (ISU) associate men's basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch, died when their small plane, a Cessna 414, crashed overnight Monday. The crash occurred about 2 miles east of the Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington, as the plane was returning from the NCAA Final Four championship game in Indianapolis. The ISU community expressed profound grief over the loss of Ward and Leetch, who were described as well-respected and much-loved colleagues. Ward had a background as a professional player and coach, while Leetch had a long tenure at ISU in various athletic department roles."
15683,"The passage details the third day of the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted in the Boston Marathon bombing, where survivors and victims' families shared their experiences. Steve Woolfenden testified about losing his leg and his son's injury, describing the chaotic scene. Heather Abbott recounted losing her foot and choosing amputation. Marc Fucarile described severe burns and the loss of a leg, with ongoing pain and medical issues. Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon, compared the bombing injuries to those from war zones and detailed the fatal injuries of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who died from rapid blood loss and internal organ damage. The prosecution rested, and the defense is set to begin, aiming to influence the jury's decision on whether Tsarnaev will receive the death penalty or life in prison."
15690,"Sofia Vergara's ex-fiance, Nick Loeb, has initiated a lawsuit in Los Angeles to prevent her from destroying two frozen female embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in November 2013, before their May 2014 split. The lawsuit, filed anonymously as ""Joe Doe"" against ""Jane Doe"" and the Art Reproductive Center, seeks to allow Loeb to implant the embryos in a surrogate, stating he would waive any parental or financial responsibilities for Vergara. Loeb believes ""life begins at fertilization"" and wants to become a father. Vergara had previously spoken about freezing eggs to plan for children with Loeb, particularly for him as he had no children. The case highlights complex legal and ethical questions regarding embryo rights, whether they are considered life or property, and the lack of clear legal precedent, especially when couples disagree and prior agreements don't cover such scenarios. Previous attempts to use surrogates with these embryos were unsuccessful."
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, a grandmother of two, has dressed as a man for 43 years in Luxor, Egypt, to avoid oppression and earn a living after being widowed at 21 and six months pregnant. She worked as a brick maker and then a shoeshiner to support and educate her daughter, Houda, in a society where it was uncommon for women to work. Dahou's appearance and voice have become masculine over time, and she insists on wearing male attire. After an interview, the Luxor governor offered her a kiosk and cash advance, and she was honored by Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as an ideal mother."
15695,"The jury in the Massachusetts murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez convicted him of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd. After deliberating for over 35 hours, hearing more than 130 witnesses, and reviewing over 400 pieces of evidence, the jurors described the process as emotionally taxing and unlike television portrayals. Jurors, including foreperson Lesa Strachan, were struck by the viciousness of the six gunshots. Jurors Kelly Dorsey and Jon Carlson emphasized that Hernandez's ""indifference""—such as leaving Lloyd to die and sunbathing hours after the slaying—was a key factor in their decision, not his football career or wealth. Juror Rosalie Oliver, who was unfamiliar with Hernandez before the trial, highlighted the cruelty of the act and the tragic impact on Lloyd's family and Hernandez's daughter. Hernandez received a sentence of life without parole."
15696,"SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, carrying 84 passengers and 9 crew from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York, after descending 28,000 feet in three minutes. Passengers, including Larry Johnson, reported fear and physical symptoms such as dizziness, visual disturbances, and some lost consciousness, after a flight attendant announced a pressurization problem.

While the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initially reported a pressurization issue, its later statement did not reference it, and SkyWest maintenance found no indication of such a problem. However, a nurse on board observed an issue affecting oxygen in the middle of the plane. Fifteen passengers were examined by medical personnel at the Buffalo airport, but none required hospitalization. The FAA, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and SkyWest are investigating the incident."
15700,"Aaron Hernandez, a former NFL player, was convicted of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd and sentenced to life without parole, also found guilty of unlawful firearm and ammunition possession. His court demeanor, characterized by bravado and a lack of remorse, contrasted with public expectations for defendants. Hernandez's life became complicated after his father's death at 16, leading to a troubled past despite a successful college and early professional football career. The New England Patriots released him quickly after his charges, and the NFL's handling of the case was seen as appropriate, with Hernandez considered an anomaly among players. After the verdict, Hernandez reportedly maintained a ""no big deal"" attitude."
15702,"Louis Jordan, 37, was rescued by the container ship Houston Express after drifting for 66 days on his 35-foot sailboat, the ""Angel,"" hundreds of miles from land. He had left Conway, South Carolina, to fish when a storm capsized his boat, breaking his mast and his shoulder. Despite the damage, he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. Jordan survived by collecting rainwater, which was challenging due to waves, and catching fish by attracting them with his laundry.

Upon rescue, Jordan was in surprisingly good condition, though dehydrated and hungry. His father, Frank Jordan, had reported him missing on January 29 and was relieved by his son's appearance, noting he spent most days in the cabin, out of the sun. Coast Guard officials found no reason to doubt Jordan's story. An unemployed truck driver, Jordan had gone to sea for bigger fish, being an inexperienced sailor. He was taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital and was expected to return to his marina."
15708,"The passage details two main aspects concerning Germanwings Flight 9525. Firstly, it addresses claims by German daily Bild and French Paris Match of a cell phone video showing the final moments of the crash. Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin stated no such video was used in the investigation, and French accident investigation agencies and Gendarmerie officials denied awareness of it, with one calling reports ""completely wrong,"" though cell phones were collected but not yet analyzed. Bild's editor-in-chief, however, stood by the report. Secondly, the passage reveals that Lufthansa confirmed co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled severe depression years before the crash, a fact known to the airline since 2009. Medical records indicated Lubitz had suicidal tendencies and underwent psychotherapy. Investigators are exploring whether his fear of losing his pilot's license due to medical issues was a motive for the crash."
15714,"A nuclear submarine undergoing repairs at Russia's Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia caught fire in a dry dock. The fire, reportedly caused by welding work, involved the rubber insulation between the submarine's light and pressure hull. Nuclear fuel had been unloaded, and there was no ammunition, armaments, chemically active substances, or fissionable materials on board. No injuries were reported, and the fire poses no threat to people or the shipyard."
15733,"John Travolta is not a fan of HBO's new documentary, ""Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,"" and has stated he has not seen it and does not care to. Travolta, a high-profile Scientologist for 40 years, described his experience with the church as positive and believes the critical documentary stems from ""disgruntled"" individuals. He credited Scientology with helping him cope with the 2009 death of his son, Jett. The documentary, based on a book by Lawrence Wright, is critical of the Church of Scientology."
15735,"A Lamborghini crashed into a guardrail at the Exotic Driving Experience at Walt Disney World Speedway on Sunday. The passenger, 36-year-old Gary Terry, died at the scene, while the 24-year-old driver, Tavon Watson, who lost control of the vehicle, was hospitalized with minor injuries. Petty Holdings, which operates the Exotic Driving Experience, released a statement extending sympathies for the tragic accident."
15739,"A gastrointestinal illness outbreak has affected 100 people (95 passengers and 5 crew members) on the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea, but the cause is yet to be determined. Two CDC staffers are scheduled to meet the ship in San Diego. Celebrity Cruises has increased cleaning, disinfection, informed passengers, and collected specimens for CDC testing. This is the third gastrointestinal outbreak for the Celebrity Infinity, with previous incidents in 2006 and 2013."
15740,"Almost 2,000 World War I soldiers' graffiti, dating back to 1916, has been discovered in an extensive underground city beneath battlefields near Naours, France. Photographer Jeff Gusky has chronicled these inscriptions, which include names, units, and dates, with about 40% being Australian, many British, 55 American, and 662 untraced. The underground city, which dates back centuries and was sealed in the 18th century before being rediscovered in the late 19th century, served as a refuge for soldiers during WWI. It became accessible recently after a change of ownership in 2013, allowing researchers to explore its maze-like passages. The graffiti offers a human connection to the soldiers, some of whom, like HJ Leach, died shortly after leaving their mark."
15744,"The University of Virginia is under ongoing investigation by the Virginia attorney general and the U.S. Department of Education for its handling of sexual assault allegations, having never expelled a student for such offenses. The retracted Rolling Stone article, despite its factual errors concerning ""Jackie's"" alleged gang rape due to the writer's failure to verify details, brought these systemic issues to public attention. The article highlighted UVA's historical failure to expel students for sexual assault, leading the university to institute an undefined ""zero-tolerance"" policy, and exposed a campus culture insensitive to victims. While the article initiated a broader conversation about sexual assault, some fear its retraction may impede progress for survivors."
15747,"Jia Jiang, a Chinese-born, American-based individual, launched ""100 Days of Rejection"" after quitting his job and facing investment rejection for his tech start-up. His project involved intentionally seeking rejection to confront his fear, leading to his book ""Rejection Proof."" A notable instance was his viral Krispy Kreme Olympic donut request, which was surprisingly accepted.

The project gained him fame, leading to talk show appearances and speaking engagements. Jiang's goal was to overcome his own fears and help others by demystifying rejection and turning it into opportunity. He emphasizes that the fear of rejection is more limiting than actual rejection, that rejection is often a numbers game, and that it shouldn't be used to measure an idea's merit. His advice includes not running away from rejection, asking why it occurred, setting a number of rejections one can take, aiming to become ""invincible"" to its pain, and remembering that rejection is an opinion."
15753,"Over the past year, over 25,000 people have fought Ebola infections, with more than 10,000 deaths. The epidemic, described as the ""most severe public health emergency seen in modern times,"" exposed global vulnerability and flaws in government systems. While the intensity has decreased and initial dire predictions of a million infections did not materialize, dozens are still newly infected each week. The week of April 5 saw 30 new confirmed cases, the lowest weekly total since May 2014. Cases have significantly fallen in Liberia and Sierra Leone, leading to surplus treatment facilities. However, in Guinea, new deaths are still being identified post-mortem, and unsafe burials are occurring, indicating potential unknown chains of transmission."
15759,"The passage uses the shooting of Walter Scott by Officer Michael Slager, captured by a bystander's video, to advocate for police body cameras. The author argues that body cameras could have prevented the tragedy, improved officer and public behavior, reduced use-of-force incidents, and restored public confidence, outweighing their cost. While body cameras are presented as an interim solution, the passage identifies the deeper problem of racial bias against black men in the criminal justice system, leading to disproportionate shootings. The author suggests long-term solutions like tougher employment screening, more training, and broader social changes, but emphasizes body cameras as an immediate way to spotlight and address this bias, particularly where it results in loss of life."
15778,"The Shariya refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, opened six months ago, houses thousands of Yazidis, primarily from Sinjar, who fled an ISIS assault. ISIS captured thousands of Yazidis, separating young women and girls for sexual slavery and forcing men to convert or face execution.

Ahlam, her three young children, and elderly parents were among those captured by ISIS, moved through various locations, and forced into labor. Ahlam secretly contacted her husband, Mahmoud, who had believed his family was dead. After witnessing brutal punishments for attempted escapes and the removal of elderly captives, Ahlam and her children escaped to Iraqi Kurdistan and were reunited with Mahmoud. Mahmoud's parents were later among 217 captives released by ISIS, but Ahlam's parents remain captive.

Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi member of Iraq's parliament, advocates for international support and airstrikes against ISIS, stating that Yazidis prefer death to being kidnapped and raped. Ahlam was spared from sexual slavery due to breastfeeding and having young children, but is haunted by the screams of girls taken by ISIS."
15779,"On Thursday, Debra Lobo, a 55-year-old American citizen and vice principal at Jinnah Medical and Dental College in Karachi, Pakistan, was wounded by gunfire. Two assailants on a motorcycle shot her in the right cheek and left arm as she drove from work. She is unconscious but expected to survive and is being treated at Aga Khan Hospital. Police found pamphlets in her car with anti-American messages. Lobo, who has lived in Pakistan since 1996, was on her way to pick up her daughters. Karachi police are investigating the incident, and the U.S. Consulate General is in contact with Pakistani authorities."
15786,"A Delaware family, including father Steve Esmond, his two teenage sons, and mother Theresa Devine, fell ill over two weeks ago while renting a villa in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. The sons (16 and 14) are in a coma and critical condition, and the father is conscious but unable to talk or move. The mother was treated and released.

Federal officials suspect the illness was caused by exposure to methyl bromide, a restricted pesticide, found in their rented villa. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is investigating if a fumigation on March 18 caused the illness and if regulations were violated. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter. Terminix, which performed pest control in a unit below the family's villa, is cooperating with authorities."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association (APhA) has adopted a new official policy discouraging its members from participating in executions, stating such activities are ""fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers."" This action strengthens the APhA's previous positions opposing the use of the term ""drug"" for lethal injection chemicals and laws regarding pharmacist participation. The APhA's decision was prompted by increased public attention on lethal injection, including incidents like Clayton Lockett's execution and the postponement of Kelly Renee Gissendaner's execution. States face challenges with lethal injection due to shortages of preferred drugs like pentobarbital, as manufacturers have stopped supplying them for capital punishment, leading states to use compounded preparations. The APhA emphasizes that pharmacists should not be involved in preparing these products or in executions in any other way. This new declaration aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations."
15791,"A new approach to discussing climate change is emerging, shifting the focus from impersonal debates about emissions to personal health impacts. This strategy was highlighted at a Howard University roundtable featuring President Obama, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. The personal relevance of health issues, such as asthma (a personal concern for Murthy), air pollution (cited by Obama as a past problem in Los Angeles), under-nutrition, and mosquito-borne diseases, aims to make the issue more compelling.

A study found that 7 out of 10 doctors reported climate change contributing to more health problems among their patients. The World Health Organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050, primarily from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure, and under-nutrition. Children, the elderly, and developing countries are identified as most vulnerable.

Solutions discussed include developing apps for real-time air quality monitoring, community planning for prevention and mitigation, and encouraging families to pressure elected officials. The success of the Clean Air Act in improving air quality is cited as a precedent. Despite these efforts, a significant portion of the public remains skeptical about global warming. Framing climate change as a public health issue is considered more emotionally compelling and offers a sense of hope that problems can be addressed."
15800,"Cyclist Wang Pingan, nearing the end of a 460-day, 29,200-kilometer journey across China, had his mountain bike stolen in Shenzhen. The theft occurred within 10 minutes of him locking it up to visit electronics markets. Despite initial police skepticism, Shenzhen police tracked down and recovered the bike, which had likely been sold twice, apprehending an alleged criminal. Wang, who had a strong emotional attachment to the bike and had vowed to walk if it wasn't recovered, can now complete his epic trip to Hainan Island."
15817,"Tens of thousands of migrants from over 20 countries, including Eritrea, Somalia, Syria, and West Africa, are drawn to Libya as the primary route to Europe. Their motivations are diverse, driven by ""push factors"" such as repression, conflict, poverty, lack of opportunities, and violence from groups like Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, and ISIS. Many already in Libya are also fleeing worsening conditions there.

In 2014, over 80% of these migrants headed to the Libyan coast, perceiving its chaos as an opportunity for embarkation. The journey is perilous, involving well-established smuggling routes across deserts and mountains, with significant risks of kidnap, robbery, being cheated, stranded, or death. Smugglers, often small groups, facilitate passage, with costs varying. Sea crossings are particularly dangerous, as migrants are frequently left to navigate unseaworthy boats with no experience.

Eritreans and Syrians constituted half of the migrant traffic to Europe last year, with a notable increase in the trafficking of African women for prostitution. As other routes have become more difficult, Libya has become the main conduit, despite its increasing dangers due to tribal feuds, militias, criminal gangs, and ISIS presence."
11317,"The passage details the significant opposition from businesses, particularly Walmart, to religious freedom laws in states like Arkansas and Indiana, due to concerns they would allow discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. Walmart's strong stance, following its decision to boost worker pay, is presented as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on social issues, prompting some Republicans to urge the party to adapt by supporting middle-class workers and non-discrimination. Walmart successfully pressured Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson to amend his state's bill. The broader business community, including companies like Angie's List and NASCAR, also voiced strong opposition, asserting that equality is beneficial for business. This debate has influenced presidential politics, with some Republican candidates moderating their views while others criticize the business community's stance. Walmart's evolution on these issues, including adding gender identity protections and same-sex partner benefits, reflects its diverse customer base and the country's increasingly progressive views on gay equality."
11323,"Easter is a central Christian holiday celebrating Christ's Crucifixion and Resurrection, signifying atonement for sins and the conquering of death. Its date varies annually, determined by cosmic events like moon phases, and is linked to Passover. The Council of Nicaea in 325 AD established that Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox, though Western and Eastern Orthodox Christians often celebrate on different dates due to calendar differences (Gregorian vs. Julian).

Peripheral traditions, such as the Easter bunny and colorful eggs, emerged after the Middle Ages; German immigrants are thought to have brought the bunny to North America, and one theory for the eggs' origin is the surplus from Lenten abstinence.

The passage describes Holy Week celebrations at the Vatican, including Palm Sunday, Pope Francis's address, and foot washing, and celebrations at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. The timing of a recent blood moon around Easter and Passover is noted as non-coincidental due to both holidays' dates being determined by moon phases. A tip for coloring Easter eggs with Kool-Aid is also mentioned."
11332,"In Japan, a political discussion is underway regarding extraterrestrial unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Defense Minister Gen Nakatani informed the Diet that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) has never encountered an extraterrestrial UFO. He stated that while the ASDF scrambles fighter jets to investigate unidentified objects that could violate airspace, they have not found any believed to be from outside Earth. This statement was in response to a query from lawmaker Antonio Inoki, who claims to have personally seen a UFO. The passage also notes that Japanese politicians have previously discussed the implications of visitors from other planets."
11349,"Lauren Hill, a 19-year-old who inspired many with her fight against brain cancer, has died. Her story gained global attention when she realized her dream of playing college basketball for Mount St. Joseph University, which, with NCAA permission, moved up a game to accommodate her. Diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in 2013, Hill continued to play and advocate, helping to raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research. Tributes from coaches, university officials, LeBron James, and the NCAA president highlighted her strength, determination, and lasting legacy of inspiring others to ""Never Give Up."""
11353,"A 20-30 foot section of a fiberglass boat, suspected to be debris from the March 11, 2011, Japan earthquake and tsunami, was spotted off Oregon's coast this week and towed to Newport. Inside, yellowtail jack fish, typically found in Japanese waters, were discovered. Biologists determined the ecological threat from invasive species was small. The boat remnants will be dried, inspected, and sent to a landfill, while the fish will be taken to the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Richie Benaud, former Australia cricket captain and legendary broadcaster, has died at 84 after being treated for skin cancer. As a player, he was a record-breaking leg-spinner and captain who never lost a series in 28 Tests, led the first full Australian tour to India and Pakistan, and was the first to achieve 2,000 runs and 200 wickets in Tests. Inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985, Benaud was equally revered as a witty and insightful commentator in Australia and the UK, often called ""the voice of cricket"" and ""peerless."" His passing generated widespread condolences from figures including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who requested flags fly at half-mast, and other prominent cricket and political figures globally."
11356,"NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer named Asteroid 316201 Malala (or 2010 ML48) after Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai. Mainzer, who discovered the asteroid in 2010, chose to honor Malala, a teenage education activist who survived a shooting, to recognize her contributions and address the lack of asteroids named after women, particularly women of color. The asteroid, about 4 kilometers in diameter with a dark surface, orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and a half years. Mainzer emphasized the importance of educating girls globally to increase human potential and solve difficult problems."
11366,"An explosion occurred late Thursday around 8:30 p.m. outside the Bauchi Motor Park bus station in Gombe, northeast Nigeria. The blast, caused by a woman leaving an explosives-laden handbag near a bus, killed at least five people and injured more than a dozen others, some severely. Although no one claimed responsibility, Boko Haram Islamists are the main suspects, as they have previously carried out similar attacks and have recently resorted to targeting ""soft targets"" like bus stations due to pressure from regional offensives. This was the first attack since Nigeria's presidential election, won by Muhammadu Buhari, who has vowed to crush Boko Haram."
11370,"The passage discusses the Summit of the Americas in Panama, where a historic handshake occurred between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. Obama's primary objective at the summit is to improve U.S. ties with Latin American nations and reverse a decline in U.S. influence, which has been lost to China, Russia, and Iran.

The U.S. has experienced past diplomatic setbacks at hemispheric summits, including a Secret Service scandal in Cartagena and a public challenge from Venezuela's Hugo Chavez in 2009. Regional leaders also previously opposed the U.S. for excluding Cuba from summits. A recent misstep involves U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, which President Nicolas Maduro is using to portray himself as a victim.

Despite these challenges and historical tensions, the passage suggests an opportunity for the U.S. to re-engage by promoting shared goals such as prosperity, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Obama's meeting with Cuban dissidents is noted as sending a positive message regarding human rights. The ultimate aim is for the U.S. to be seen as a true partner in improving the lives of people in the region."
11384,"The passage details the pervasive issue of sexual harassment in India, beginning with the author's personal experience of being groped on a crowded Mumbai train at age 13, an incident she kept secret for 25 years. This experience highlights the widespread nature of harassment, with a study indicating 80% of Mumbai women face street harassment. The passage describes various forms of harassment, including groping, stalking, unwanted photos, and leering, noting that these ""milder"" forms are often overlooked despite their intimidating impact, leading women to limit their activities.

The author, who conducts workshops, observes that while most women have experienced harassment, very few report it due to shame, fear of disrepute, and issues with police. Despite these barriers, she encourages women to speak up, emphasizing that India has laws against sexual violence. The passage cites cases like Rajendra Pachauri and Tarun Tejpal, where reporting harassment led to significant consequences, demonstrating the potential for women to effect cultural change by speaking out."
11395,"Mountaineers have returned to Mount Everest for the climbing season after a deadly 2014 season, marked by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall that killed 16 Nepalis in the single deadliest incident on Everest. In response, Nepal has changed the route through the Khumbu Icefall to a longer, central path, aiming for greater safety by avoiding the previous accident site, despite requiring more crevasses and ladders. Nepal issued 347 permits this year, a slight increase from last year.

Due to perceived increased danger on the Nepal side, some companies are shifting to the northern route from China, which has seen an increase in permits (320 issued), as it avoids the icefall. This shift raises concerns for Nepal's tourism-dependent economy and Sherpa livelihoods. While Sherpas are returning, their families are anxious, and some climbers are also returning despite the risks."
11400,"The passage describes a growing trend of direct-to-consumer medical testing, driven by public figures and legislative changes, with a burgeoning private sector offering accessible lab services. The author argues that this ""freedom to test"" will primarily lead to increased medical care rather than improved health. Potential negative consequences include anemia from excessive testing, more doctor visits for often benign ""abnormal"" results in healthy individuals, unnecessary follow-up tests and procedures, increased anxiety, and higher healthcare costs. The author cites examples like over-treatment for prostate and breast cancer and a surge in thyroid cancer diagnoses in South Korea due to screening. While acknowledging the utility of diagnostic tests for acute problems, the author suggests that testing healthy individuals often makes them feel worse. The passage concludes by advocating for regulation of direct-to-consumer testing by the FDA and public education on the appropriate interpretation and utility of medical data, emphasizing that self-testing does not necessarily equate to better health."
11410,"Canadian fighter jets carried out their first airstrike against ISIS in Syria, hitting one of the Sunni militant group's garrisons near its de facto capital of Raqqa on Wednesday. Canada's Department of National Defence described the strike as successful, and the CF-18 Hornets and their crews safely returned to base. This action is part of the U.S.-led coalition's efforts against ISIS, with Canadian warplanes having previously conducted strikes in Iraq since November. The expansion of airstrikes into Syria was announced last month by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, with Defense Minister Jason Kenney stating it demonstrates resolve to tackle terrorism and promote international security."
11768,"The passage describes two recent multiple births. On April 8, Danielle Busby gave birth to the first all-female quintuplets in the world since 1969, in Houston. The five girls, Ava Lane, Hazel Grace, Olivia Marie, Parker Kate, and Riley Paige, were delivered via C-section at 28 weeks and two days. The Busby family, including parents Danielle and Adam and big sister Blayke, are blogging about their experience. The passage notes an earlier report that the Busby girls were the first all-female quintuplets in the U.S. was incorrect, as all-female quintuplets were born in San Antonio in 1959, though they died within 24 hours.

Separately, Sharon and Korey Rademacher welcomed twin girls, Mary Ann Grace and Brianna Faith, on March 11 in Pensacola, Florida. They kept the gender and number of babies a secret from family and friends, and a video of their family's reactions to meeting the twins was uploaded to YouTube, gaining over 700,000 views."
11779,"The U.S. Justice Department has revised its no-fly list policy, now allowing Americans on the list to be informed of their status, the reasons for their ban from commercial flights, and the opportunity to dispute it. This change stems from a June federal judge's ruling that the old process violated the Fifth Amendment's due process, prompted by an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawsuit.

Under the new policy, individuals can apply for redress through the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP), receive specific criteria for their inclusion, and submit written disputes with supporting materials, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) providing a final decision. Previously, the government did not confirm or deny inclusion. However, the ACLU is not satisfied, asserting the new process falls short of constitutional requirements by denying meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing, and plans to challenge it further."
11791,"Texas veterinarian Dr. Kristen Lindsey allegedly shot a cat with an arrow and posted a photo of it on Facebook, claiming it was her ""first bow kill"" of a ""feral tomcat."" This post triggered widespread outrage, leading to numerous calls to her workplace, the Washington County Animal Clinic, and crashing its website. An animal rescuer claimed the cat was a missing pet named ""Tiger,"" not a feral cat. As a result of the controversy, Lindsey was fired from the clinic, removed her Facebook post, and eventually shut down her page. The Austin County Sheriff's office is investigating the incident, and Lindsey could face charges. Animal rights activists are pushing for prosecution, with one organization offering a reward for evidence leading to an arrest and conviction, while some customers defended Lindsey."
11795,"A mother became an online sensation after being filmed confronting her son, who was apparently involved in the Baltimore riots. She pulled him from a crowd, repeatedly smacked him, and screamed at him, reportedly after seeing him on television throwing rocks at police. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts publicly thanked the unnamed mother, wishing more parents would take charge of their children. The incident was captured on video by CNN affiliate WMAR."
11808,"The passage describes the severe impact of an earthquake in Nepal's Kavre District, particularly in the village of Ravi Opi, located 30 kilometers east of Kathmandu. Roads leading to the area are heavily damaged, making travel slow. In Ravi Opi, 90% of houses are uninhabitable, with residents fearing aftershocks.

The community, which relies on farming, has received little aid. Personal tragedies include Maili Tamang, 62, whose two-story house was destroyed, leaving her injured and her daughter-in-law transported to a hospital. Mahesh Koiraba, 31, lost his 2-year-old daughter, Prati, when their house collapsed.

Displaced families are living in makeshift shelters, reporting no government support or outside help. Rain is further complicating recovery efforts, and there is ongoing fear of aftershocks. The passage notes that remote, harder-hit areas, often only accessible on foot, have yet to receive aid, and the full extent of the human loss there remains unknown."
11817,"Marvel Comics superhero Hawkeye is a master with the bow and arrow, but the character, played by Jeremy Renner, also has a secret talent for singing Ed Sheeran parodies. Renner showcased this skill on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" where he sang a reworked version of ""Thinking Out Loud,"" claiming other ""powers"" like collecting scarves and berets, playing the trombone, and opening pickle jars. Beyond this, Renner has starred in ""Avengers"" films, ""The Hurt Locker,"" ""American Hustle,"" and films in the ""Bourne"" and ""Mission Impossible"" franchises."
11821,"Olivia Munn has been cast as the telepathic character Psylocke (Betsy Braddock) in ""X-Men: Apocalypse,"" a follow-up to ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" Director Bryan Singer announced the casting via Instagram. The movie is currently in production and is set for release on May 27, 2016. Psylocke, created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe, first appeared in the ""Captain Britain"" series before joining the X-Men in 1987. Munn will join a cast that includes James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence."
11826,"Cosmologist Stephen Hawking has partnered with Monty Python to recreate their ""Galaxy Song"" from the 1983 film ""The Meaning of Life."" This collaboration, available as a 7-inch single and for download, is in honor of Saturday's Record Store Day. The accompanying video features Brian Cox, whom Hawking knocks over before singing the song in his computerized voice and embarking on a cosmic ride, a scene derived from Monty Python's live shows. ""Galaxy Song,"" written by Eric Idle and John Du Prez, is described as an ""intricate and informative lecture"" on the Universe. Hawking has previously been featured on Pink Floyd's ""Talkin' Hawkin'."""
11838,"The passage recounts the author's experience witnessing the 1980 Miami riots, sparked by the acquittal of police officers in Arthur McDuffie's death, and connects this event to a history of ""race riots"" in the U.S., including those in the 1960s, Los Angeles in 1992, and Baltimore in 2015. These riots are often triggered by perceived unjust police actions and are described as ""the language of the unheard,"" stemming from feelings of hopelessness and dehumanization.

While initially fearful of the violence, the author later learned that riots have historically played a role in advancing civil rights by galvanizing government officials to address underlying issues like racism, joblessness, poverty, and police brutality, leading to commissions and legislative actions. The passage contrasts this with the power of nonviolent protest, citing the Ferguson protests as an example where peaceful advocacy led to government action and recommendations for police reform. The Baltimore riots were quashed, but the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard."
11839,"On Sunday night, the Israeli military conducted airstrikes in the occupied Golan Heights, targeting four militants who had crossed from Syria. The militants were allegedly attempting to plant an explosive device on the Israeli border to detonate against Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel. The airstrikes prevented the bombing, and three of the alleged attackers were killed. The Golan Heights, seized by Israel from Syria in 1967 and later annexed, is internationally considered occupied territory."
11840,"The ""Cheryl's birthday"" problem is a Singapore logic puzzle that went viral after being posted on Facebook by television host Kenneth Kong. It was designed to test high-school students competing in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad on April 8. The problem involves Cheryl giving her friends Albert and Bernard a list of 10 possible birthday dates, and their conversation provides clues to deduce the correct date. Solutions have been offered by various sources, including a Georgia Tech mathematician, The New York Times, and The Washington Post."
11858,"A severe HIV outbreak, ongoing since mid-December, has affected rural Scott and Jackson counties in Indiana, primarily among users of the prescription opioid Opana through shared needle injection. As of Friday, 142 people have tested positive for HIV, a significant number for the area's small population.

In response, Indiana declared a public health emergency in March. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health leaders are working to control the outbreak by providing additional resources, including a weekly clinic, door-to-door education on needle sharing, and a temporary needle exchange program. Job services are also being offered.

Contributing factors to the rapid spread include a lack of awareness about needle sharing among younger individuals, the nature of Opana requiring frequent injections with larger needles, and a long-standing problem of prescription drug abuse and shared drug use within families in the region. Health leaders are concerned this situation serves as a warning for the potential spread of HIV and other diseases like hepatitis C nationally, given the increase in illegal prescription drug use."
11860,"Joni Mitchell, a singer-songwriter and 1997 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, was hospitalized a month ago after being found unconscious. Her longtime friend, Leslie Morris, filed a legal petition on April 28 to become Mitchell's conservator, stating Mitchell is unconscious and unable to care for herself. However, a statement on Mitchell's website, approved by Morris, claims Mitchell is alert, comprehends, and is not in a coma, with a full recovery expected. Mitchell's publicist confirmed the website's accuracy. A doctor's declaration indicates Mitchell will likely be unable to attend court hearings for four to six months due to her medical condition. Fans are posting tributes on WeLoveYouJoni.com."
11870,"The Hillary Clinton presidential campaign anticipates inquiries and criticism regarding conflicts of interest involving foreign donors to Clinton family charities, particularly with the release of Peter Schweizer's book ""Clinton Cash."" Allegations include the Clinton Foundation receiving funds from foreign governments, such as Canada, which promoted the Keystone XL pipeline endorsed by the State Department, and the Clinton Global Initiative accepting donations from banks under investigation by U.S. government agencies.

However, the passage notes a lack of a ""smoking gun"" showing a clear exchange of money for favors, or evidence that the Clintons knew of ongoing investigations into donor banks. Beyond conflict of interest concerns, the charities have also faced criticism for poor management, running deficits, and a case of deception involving a con man. The author suggests that voters may prioritize issues like jobs over these charity concerns, and polls indicate Clinton's expected presidential win, leading her to dismiss these issues as ""distractions."""
11875,"Andrew Lesnie, an Oscar-winning cinematographer, died at age 59 from a heart attack on Monday. He was known for his decade-long collaboration with director Peter Jackson on the six ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"" films, winning an Oscar for ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Lesnie also worked with Jackson on ""King Kong"" and ""The Lovely Bones,"" and his work on the ""Babe"" films initially impressed Jackson. His other notable credits include ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Water Diviner,"" ""I Am Legend,"" and ""The Last Airbender."" A Sydney native, he was inducted into the Australian Cinematographers Society Hall of Fame in 2002."
11877,"The passage criticizes Google's Waze app, specifically its ""traffic cop"" feature, which allows users to pinpoint the location of police officers. This feature is presented as a significant risk to law enforcement, especially given that ambush attacks were the leading cause of felonious deaths for officers in 2014. The app was reportedly used by Ismaaiyl Brinsley before he assassinated two NYPD officers. The author argues that Waze makes officers identifiable targets for its 50 million users, posing dangers not only from criminals but also from drunk drivers and speeders seeking to evade law enforcement. Despite acquiring Waze in 2013 and claiming the app promotes the ""common good,"" Google has refused to discuss these safety concerns with law enforcement organizations, which the passage contends contradicts Google's reputation for corporate social responsibility."
11888,"Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe created the ""Toy Soldiers"" project to counter desensitization to war imagery and prompt viewers' personal responses. For the project, Thorpe, a landscape photographer, posed real soldiers from the Polisario Front—an independence movement clashing with Morocco in the underreported Western Sahara conflict—like plastic toy figurines in the region's harsh desert landscape, often at historic battle sites. He worked with 50-60 soldiers at a time, who also helped construct the platforms for the poses. Thorpe hopes his images will raise questions about the future consumption of war images amidst diminishing attention spans. His ""Toy Soldiers"" book is available for pre-order."
11900,"On Monday, a gunman shot and killed Ron Lane, the print shop operator and a longtime employee, on the campus of Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina. The shooting occurred on the third floor of a campus building. The school was placed on lockdown, and the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, remains at large. Stancil is a former employee of the victim and a former student at the college, and authorities described him as ""armed and dangerous."" Officials stated it was an isolated, not random, situation. All buildings have been cleared, and a person found in a restroom after tear gas was deployed was not the suspect."
11908,"Colorado's New Belgium Brewery and Ben & Jerry's are collaborating to create a beer inspired by salted caramel brownie ice cream. This partnership aims to raise awareness for issues both companies are passionate about, reflecting their shared history of social activism and their status as ""B Corporations"" certified for meeting social, environmental, accountability, and transparency standards. While details of the campaign will be announced later, the beer is expected to be released in the fall. There are no plans for a beer-flavored ice cream."
11910,"In the NCAA men's basketball Final Four, the Wisconsin Badgers defeated previously undefeated Kentucky 71-64, ending the Wildcats' 38-0 perfect season bid. Frank Kaminsky led Wisconsin with 20 points and 11 rebounds. In the other semifinal, four-time national champion Duke dominated Michigan State 81-61, with Justise Winslow scoring 19 points. Wisconsin, seeking its first title since 1941, will face Duke in the championship game."
11911,"Saudi airstrikes resumed in southern Yemen on Wednesday, despite Saudi Arabia's Tuesday announcement of ending ""Operation Decisive Storm"" and beginning ""Operation Renewal of Hope,"" a new initiative focused on a political process. The strikes resumed after Houthi rebels attacked a Yemeni government military brigade. Houthi rebels called for U.N.-sponsored peace talks, but only after a complete halt to attacks, and released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi. Saudi Arabia and its coalition launched airstrikes on March 26 to restore the Yemeni government, overthrown by Houthi rebels, and claim to have degraded Houthi military infrastructure. Both Saudi Arabia and Yemeni President Hadi seek a political solution and stability for Yemen. Separately, U.S. drone strikes against al Qaeda militants were reported in southern Yemen, and the U.S. is conducting ""manned reconnaissance"" off Yemen for maritime security."
11922,"The key Iraqi city of Ramadi, west of Baghdad and capital of Anbar province, is facing a severe ISIS offensive, with security ""collapsing rapidly."" Falih Essawi, deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, reported that ISIS militants were close to taking the city, having made significant advances in areas east of Ramadi and rolling into its center, following earlier gains north and south. Essawi, on a front line, pleaded for urgent Iraqi government reinforcements and U.S.-led coalition air support, citing at least 10 Iraqi security forces killed and over 100 wounded, and at least 150,000 people fleeing the city. Despite the dire situation described, a U.S. military official stated that Ramadi's fall was ""not imminent,"" noting that the U.S.-led coalition had conducted seven airstrikes in Ramadi since Monday, and that the city has been a target of a months-long offensive with ISIS controlling or influencing sizable parts."
11932,"The passage discusses Equal Pay Day, observed on April 14, which highlights that women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn, requiring them to work until April 14 of the next year to match men's previous year's earnings. This wage gap results in women losing an average of $431,000 over a 40-year career and could lift half of working single mothers out of poverty if closed. The author proposes that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, aiming to portray herself as a populist champion for ""everyday Americans,"" should announce a ""political stunt"": if elected, she would take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap. This symbolic action would demonstrate solidarity with working women, highlight the pay inequity, and leverage the effectiveness of symbolism in modern politics."
11945,"Modern Jihadi groups like ISIS and Boko Haram employ a distinct and strategic approach to women, differing from previous groups like Al-Qaeda. Their systematic abuse, sexual slavery, and forced marriages are not merely battlefield tactics but are integral to their larger goal of building a ""caliphate,"" a Sharia-ruled state based on their interpretation of early Islam.

Women are considered indispensable for establishing this new society, needed for domestic roles and raising children, even if viewed as property. Examples include Yazidi girls sold into slavery by ISIS and thousands of women and girls kidnapped by Boko Haram, who are forced to convert and marry fighters. This methodical capture, assault, and subjugation of women, which includes severe restrictions and abuses, is a deliberate strategy to control and establish the society they envision, leading to immense suffering for the victims. These actions are described as war crimes and potential crimes against humanity."
11948,"SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, plans to launch a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket carrying an uncrewed Dragon cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) on Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida, after Monday's launch was scrubbed due to weather. The Dragon will deliver over 4,300 pounds of supplies, including research equipment and an espresso maker, and later return over 3,000 pounds of experiments and trash to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.

A key, unprecedented part of the mission is SpaceX's attempt to land the Falcon 9's bottom stage upright on an autonomous spaceport drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean off Florida. This effort aims to drastically cut space access costs by enabling rocket reuse, potentially reducing costs by a factor of a hundred. SpaceX has previously attempted this, with one rocket exploding, and estimates a 50% chance of success. This is SpaceX's sixth mission to the ISS, and the company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station."
11979,"The Boston Marathon bombing trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is ongoing, with jurors deliberating for over seven hours but not yet reaching a verdict. Tsarnaev, 21, faces life in prison or the death penalty on 30 counts, 17 of which carry capital punishment.

Prosecutors argue Tsarnaev, along with his deceased older brother Tamerlan, intentionally committed a terrorist act on Patriots' Day to terrorize the country and punish America, presenting graphic testimony and videos of the bombings' aftermath, which killed three spectators (including an 8-year-old boy) and an MIT police officer, and severely injured many others. They contend both brothers were ""equally guilty"" and ""partners in crime,"" citing Tsarnaev's ""manifesto"" and militant literature.

The defense concedes Tsarnaev's involvement but maintains he was swayed by his older, more radicalized brother, Tamerlan, who they claim was the instigator. Their strategy aims to spare Tsarnaev's life. If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one capital count, the trial will proceed to a second penalty phase to determine sentencing."
12008,"The passage explores the evolving views on marriage, particularly among millennials, suggesting a potential ""marriage apocalypse."" Millennials prioritize careers, education, and financial stability, viewing wedding costs and personal debt as barriers to marriage. Influenced by high divorce rates, they believe love doesn't require marriage and prefer personal happiness and travel.

A Pew Research report indicates that many, especially young adults, are comfortable with priorities other than marriage and children. While religious leaders and economists express concerns about societal well-being, the passage notes the debate on whether marriage causes economic benefit or vice versa. Scandinavia is presented as an example where marriage is declining, with high rates of cohabitation and out-of-wedlock births, yet high quality of life, attributed to factors like secularism, cost, and lack of social or economic advantages for marriage. Ultimately, millennials view marriage as a choice based purely on love, not pressure or timing. The author, a child of divorce who married later in life, questions whether a society without marriage would be equally well-off."
12060,"Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, have taken control of Tikrit from ISIS, a significant victory for the Iraqi government after multiple failed attempts. Despite the liberation, fear remains due to widespread booby traps, including explosives-laden vehicles and buildings, and dismantled IEDs. Officials are also concerned about potential ""scorched earth"" reprisals by Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen against Tikrit's Sunni population, fearing it could stoke anger and jeopardize government stability.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi claimed the victory, which was supported by U.S.-led airstrikes and marked the first open participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines. This success sets the stage for future operations, including the retaking of Mosul. ISIS's nine-month rule in Tikrit was characterized by brutality, including a reported massacre of air force cadets and the destruction of an ancient church."
12068,"The Red Cross called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen, especially in and near Aden, to allow aid for the wounded and prevent further deaths. This appeal came before a UN Security Council meeting where Russia's draft resolution to halt Saudi-led airstrikes against Houthi rebels failed to gain approval, partly because it did not call for the Houthis to stop fighting or for political talks. The conflict began after Houthi rebels forced President Hadi from power, leading to fighting and intervention by Saudi-led Arab air forces. Recent Saudi strikes targeted military facilities in Sanaa. The UN reported 519 people killed and 1,700 wounded in Yemen in two weeks, with 58 killed and 200 injured in Aden in two days. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) also holds sway in eastern Yemen, and one of its leaders was recently freed from jail. The French military evacuated 44 people from Balhaf."
12073,"New York Police Department Detective Patrick Cherry was placed on modified assignment and faces investigation after a video of his angry exchange with an Uber driver went viral. The altercation began when the Uber driver gestured to Cherry about allegedly not using a blinker, leading Cherry to yell, mock the driver's accent, use expletives, and threaten him.

Cherry has since apologized for his behavior. Police Commissioner William Bratton condemned the detective's actions as ""unacceptable"" and apologized to the driver and passengers, while Mayor Bill de Blasio stated there is no place for discriminatory language from public servants. Uber called the behavior ""wrong and unacceptable"" and is supporting its driver. The incident is being investigated by the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau and the Civilian Complaint Review Board, with Cherry facing potential suspension, reassignment, or loss of his top-secret security clearance."
13806,"Cameron Hardin's third week as Head of Household concluded, during which he nominated Felicia Cannon and Mecole Hayes, and won the Power of Veto. On October 5, Mecole Hayes was evicted from Big Brother 25 by a unanimous 7-0 vote, becoming a member of the BB25 jury. Following the eviction, Bowie Jane won the Head of Household competition, marking her first competition win, and is now the HOH for Week 10."
13814,"Social Security benefits will increase by 3.2% in 2024 for over 66 million retirees, an average growth of over $50 per month starting in January. This cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), announced by the Social Security Administration (SSA) on October 12, 2023, aims to help retirees manage increasing living expenses. Additionally, the maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax will rise to $168,600 in 2024. The COLA is tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. Beneficiaries will receive notices in early December. The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) estimated this 3.2% COLA would increase the average monthly retiree benefit by $57.30."
13815,"Tonee Turner, a 22-year-old artist from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, went missing on December 30, 2019, after last being seen at Dobra Tea. Her family has been actively searching for her, distributing flyers. Tonee, who worked as a metal fabricator and a part-time ceramics teacher, spoke to her sister around 6:00 p.m. on the day she disappeared. Her purse, containing her mobile phone, wallet, and keys, was later found near a bridge, possibly near Interstate 80 in Homestead, Pennsylvania. Tonee is described as 5'3"" tall, 130 pounds, with chin-length black/dark brown hair, brown eyes, multiple piercings, and a spiral tattoo on her left shoulder. She was last seen wearing a black zip-up jacket, a gray ""Habla Espanol"" shirt, gray cargo pants, and possibly a black head wrap. Authorities urge anyone with information to contact Pittsburgh Police at 412-323-7800, referencing agency case number 19-264396."
13816,"Xanax (alprazolam), a benzodiazepine, is prescribed for anxiety symptoms and works by enhancing GABA effects in the brain, leading to a calming effect. It provides rapid, short-term relief for acute anxiety episodes, making it useful for emergencies or brief use. However, concerns exist regarding its potential for tolerance development, which can lead to increased dosage, dependence, and withdrawal. For chronic anxiety, long-term use is not sustainable, and other treatments like therapy or lifestyle changes are often more appropriate. Xanax should be used cautiously, under professional guidance, and as part of a holistic approach to anxiety management."
13823,"U.S. Army troops from Fort Cavazos and Fort Bliss in Texas are deploying to the Middle East, joining a total of 900 U.S. troops, including those from Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Fort Liberty, North Carolina. This deployment aims to protect U.S. forces from drone and rocket attacks, following at least 12 attacks in Iraq and four in Syria that injured 21 U.S. personnel. Soldiers from Fort Bliss will primarily man a THAAD system, while others from Fort Bliss and Fort Cavazos will serve as ""air defense headquarters elements."" The remaining troops will be attached to Patriot and Avenger batteries. The deployment is for regional deterrence and force protection, not to Israel."
13827,"Bowie Jane, the new Head of Household (HOH) on Big Brother 25, has nominated Felica Cannon and Cirie Fields. The houseguests, including Jag Bains who is aligned with Cameron Hardin, want Bowie to backdoor Cameron, viewing him as a ""competition beast"" who could win the game. However, Bowie is not interested in naming Cameron as a replacement nominee.

Cameron wants Bowie to backdoor Cory Wurtrnberger, whom he sees as his biggest threat. While Bowie agrees Cory should leave, she hesitates to target him. Cory, in turn, has approached Bowie about backdooring Cameron.

The Power of Veto (POV) players are Bowie, Felica, Cirie, Jag, Matt, and America, with Cory hosting. If Bowie, Jag, or Matt win the POV, nominations will remain unchanged. If America Lopez, Cirie, or Felica win, Bowie must name a replacement nominee, and she might then target Cory. The POV competition is scheduled for Saturday evening."
13829,"Cameron Hardin was backdoored and evicted from Big Brother 25 in Week 10 because he kept winning challenges and struggled to connect with some houseguests, a point Felicia Cannon frequently noted. Following his eviction, Jag Bains became the Secret HOH after winning a BB Comics challenge. Jag then secretly nominated Blue Kim and Felicia for eviction, fulfilling his plan to target Blue. This led to Felicia and Blue expressing regret about Cameron's departure, with Felicia stating she missed his upfront nature, and Blue realizing Cameron's warnings about Jag and Matt Klotz targeting her were accurate. A Double Veto competition is set for Week 11, which is expected to heavily impact the game."
13834,"Bowie Jane, as the Head of Household for Week 10, nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields for eviction. Jag Bains won the Power of Veto (POV) and plans to use it. Bowie Jane intends to name Cameron Hardin as the replacement nominee, which would make him the first BB25 jury member if the plan holds. The Veto Meeting is scheduled for Monday, October 9, where Cameron's potential backdoor eviction will be addressed, amidst houseguests feeding Bowie Jane false stories about him."
13840,"New York House Republicans are attempting to expel fellow Republican George Santos from Congress via a privileged motion. This action follows 23 new federal criminal counts against Santos, including accusations of charging campaign contributors' credit cards without consent and identity theft, in addition to prior accusations of fabricating his resume. Led by Representative Anthony D'Esposito, they argue Santos is ""not fit to serve."" A vote on his expulsion is scheduled for the coming week, though Santos has stated he will not resign. His removal faces challenges, as Republican leadership might spare him due to their slim majority, and expulsion requires 290 votes, making it difficult to achieve."
13842,"Survivor host Jeff Probst explained the new sit-out rule, which was changed due to fan complaints about unclear rules and the shortened 26-day season length. Previously, castaways could not sit out consecutive challenges within a single cycle, but this rule reset at Tribal Council, potentially allowing someone to sit out consecutive Immunity Challenges. The change was specifically influenced by Claire Rafson from Survivor 44, who sat out three consecutive Immunity Challenges, leading to fan and tribe member pushback. The new rule states that a castaway ""cannot sit out of back-to-back challenges, period,"" meaning whoever sits out one challenge must participate in the next, simplifying the rule for viewers."
13843,"Nick Newman forces Sally Spectra to choose between him and his brother, Adam Newman, due to Sally's unresolved feelings for Adam. Sally is conflicted, caring for Nick but also having a strong connection to Adam. She considers leaving both to avoid making a choice. Despite having sex with Adam, which solidifies their connection, her feelings for Nick remain. Nick and Adam both want her decision and promise support. Nick physically attacks Adam, and after Sally breaks up their fight, Nick again demands she choose. Her decision is anticipated to shock viewers."
13846,"Scientists at Rice University have received $45 million to develop HAMMR, a novel three-inch implant-based system for cancer treatment. This chargeable device aims to improve immunotherapy outcomes by continuously monitoring a patient's cancer and adjusting drug doses in real-time via a closed-loop system, potentially eradicating cancer in 60 days. It addresses the limitations of current infrequent diagnostic tools by providing real-time tumor data. Human trials are expected within five years, starting with recurrent ovarian cancer, with potential application for a broad range of peritoneal cancers."
13848,"The Miami Dolphins, despite an improved defense, are considering addressing needs on their offensive and defensive lines as the trade deadline approaches. One potential target is Chase Young of the Commanders, despite it seeming unlikely. The Dolphins' defensive line has struggled to generate consistent pressure, with Emmanuel Ogbah being ineffective and the line as a whole underperforming. Trading for Young, who has 5 sacks this season and is five years younger than Ogbah, would be a significant upgrade. Acquiring Young would necessitate a long-term contract extension, which the Dolphins could potentially manage. Adding Young to their defensive front would enhance the line's effectiveness, boost sack numbers, and aid the defense in their playoff push."
13850,"In a significant development in a 1988 Georgia cold case, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) identified human remains found in a Jenkins County dumpster on February 14, 1988, as Chong Un Kim. Kim, a 26-year-old Korean immigrant residing in Hinesville, Georgia, was found wrapped in plastic and duct tape inside a suitcase, having died of asphyxiation approximately four to seven days prior.

After previous efforts including fingerprint, dental record, and sketch comparisons failed, the GBI collaborated with Othram, Inc. in 2023. Through advanced DNA testing and a genealogical search, funded by ""Project Justice,"" Kim was identified. The GBI notified her family in October 2023 and is now seeking information from the public regarding the case."

13872,"Work permit processing for migrants will continue even if the federal government shuts down, as the responsible agency, USCIS, is funded by filing fees. The Biden administration's decision to include Venezuelan nationals who entered the US by July 31 in Temporary Protected Status may hasten work permit acquisition for thousands of asylum seekers in New York City. USCIS is implementing measures to speed up the process, such as providing education sessions, issuing alerts, offering mobile biometric services, and aiming for an average 30-day processing window. Despite its ability to function during a shutdown, USCIS asserts that additional Congressional funding is required to process more work permits and TPS applications."
13874,"China has launched its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines, which the Pentagon states will enable long-range precision strikes and enhance power projection, a development observed closely given concerns about a potential Taiwan invasion. The Pentagon's report also details other significant military expansions, including a projected increase to nearly 1000 nuclear warheads by 2030 (up from 500), construction of over 300 new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos, and exploration of conventionally armed intercontinental-range missile systems capable of striking the United States. Concurrently, China's navy, already the world's largest at 370 ships and submarines, is projected to grow to 435 by 2030, making its simulated attack operations and rhetoric against Taiwan a serious concern."

13894,"On October 30, District Judge Alia Moses granted a temporary restraining order requested by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton against the Biden administration. Paxton sued after U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents were observed cutting concertina wire at the southern border, which Texas claimed allowed migrants to freely cross. The judge's order prevents agents from removing the wire, with an exception for medical emergencies likely to result in serious injury or death if no other life-saving means are available. This temporary relief is in effect until November 13, with arguments from both sides scheduled for November 7. Texas asserts the wire was cut to allow illegal entry, while the Biden administration states it was to provide medical aid and fulfill their responsibility to take migrants into custody."
13895,"Illinois Senate President Don Harmon is facing controversy for supporting legislation that would provide substantial property tax breaks to Cook County nursing homes, as he has received nearly $2 million in campaign contributions from the nursing home industry's trade group, the Health Care Council of Illinois. The legislation, which passed the General Assembly, aimed to reclassify private, for-profit nursing homes as residential property, lowering their taxes by millions.

Governor J.B. Pritzker, however, used an amendatory veto to remove the nursing home provision, arguing it would shift the financial burden onto suburban Cook County homeowners and small businesses. Harmon has not commented on the contributions or his stance, though his spokesman stated legislative decisions are for the public good. The Health Care Council defended Harmon, denying a direct link between contributions and his position. The industry is now seeking legislative support to override the governor's veto."

13916,"The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sued Dollar General after a worker in Georgia was reportedly fired in September 2020, immediately after informing her manager of her pregnancy. The manager questioned the safety of her working while pregnant, and she received a separation notice citing ""health reasons."" Dollar General has agreed to pay $42,500 to settle the suit. The EEOC emphasizes that pregnancy should not be a reason for employers to assume an employee cannot work and enforces federal laws, including the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, to protect pregnant employees from discrimination."
13917,"JetBlue is cutting 14 routes from its service, starting in January and continuing into March. The most affected cities are New York and Boston, primarily involving John F. Kennedy International, LaGuardia, and Boston Logan International airports, with Los Angeles International also impacted. This decision is due to the dissolution of the Northeast Alliance with American Airlines and ongoing ATC staffing challenges. Affected destinations include Burlington, Miami, Nashville, and Washington DC, among others. Passengers booked on these routes for 2024 will be offered alternative flights or refunds."
13925,"A former FBI special agent, David Paitsel, and a D.C. real estate developer, Brian Bailey, were sentenced for their involvement in an extensive bribery scheme. The scheme centered on the unauthorized sharing of confidential data from the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development.

Bailey was convicted of paying Dawne Dorsey, a program specialist, for confidential Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) notices, which contain private tenant details. Bailey also paid Paitsel to retrieve contact information of tenants with TOPA rights, which Paitsel accessed through his FBI position.

Paitsel received 24 months in prison, 24 months of supervised release, a $100 assessment, and a $10,600 forfeiture. Bailey was sentenced to 48 months in prison, 24 months of supervised release, a $100 assessment, and a $250,000 fine.

A former employee accused Vereb, then secretary of legislative affairs, of making lewd and misogynistic remarks and facing retaliation for speaking up. Vereb has since resigned. The settlement, finalized in early September and made public last month, allocated $196,365 to the complainant and over $49,000 to legal firms. As part of the agreement, the governor's office committed to providing sexual harassment training to relevant staff and allowing the woman to seek other state employment. Governor Shapiro has largely avoided commenting on the allegations but met with women Democratic senators as the situation unfolded."
13933,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott condemned the attack on Israel, expressing support for Israel and Americans in the country. He announced increased security at Jewish and Israel-related locations in Texas, directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to support local partners, and distributed $4 million in grant funding to 31 Jewish organizations for security. Governor Abbott also restricted Texas agencies from purchasing or exporting goods to the Gaza Strip if tied to Hamas, and directed the Texas flag to be flown at half-staff until Saturday in response to the conflict and American lives lost. He posted an Executive Order supporting Israel on X. The passage notes that over 1,600 people, including Israeli, Palestinian, and American citizens, have died."

13503,"A surprisingly good Northern Lights display occurred across the Midwest and Northern Plains, including Minnesota, Michigan, southern Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Omaha, Nebraska, late Friday night into early Saturday, October 20-21, 2023. This display was caused by a weak Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) with slower solar wind speeds, which was not projected to be strong and was missed by many aurora hunters due to the absence of a typical data spike. Instead, subtle hints like a gap in satellite data, a slight increase in solar winds, and a gradual decrease in Bz values indicated the CME's arrival and the potential for lights, which Charlie Bourdo observed hours before the event."

Husbands pled guilty to bank fraud, specifically admitting to stealing $108,000 from Regions Bank customer accounts in Mississippi between November 2021 and April 2022. The scheme involved creating false identification documents to withdraw funds.

At the time of her federal arrest, she was already incarcerated in Texas for similar charges and still faces pending cases in other states."
13558,"Texas Representative Eddies Morales proposed that migrants pay $2,000 to enter the U.S. This fee would cover an initial processing fee and a non-voting ID card with an RFID chip that also functions as a credit card. Morales, whose district includes high crossing points, believes this would generate significant revenue (e.g., $3.2 million daily in the Eagle Pass/Del Rio sector) and help address the migrant crisis, as he feels President Biden's current efforts are insufficient given high migrant encounter numbers. He also suggested workforce agreements between U.S. and Mexican governors."

He nominated Blue Kim and America Lopez for eviction, with Blue being his primary target. Jag intends not to use the POV to ensure Blue's eviction. While Blue is campaigning to stay, Bowie Jane and Matt want her out, and Jag needs one more vote for her eviction out of four total votes. A double eviction is approaching, and Jag, unable to compete in the next HOH, relies on Matt winning to secure his safety, as Blue's eviction is likely sealed and Jag could follow her during the double eviction if Matt doesn't win."

The incident started when a guard at the U.S. Census Bureau's headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, was shot at least once in the upper body after approaching a vehicle where two people were arguing; the guard was in extremely critical condition. The suspect then fled, leading police on a chase during which gunshots were fired at multiple locations.

15777,"The passage discusses Andreas Lubitz, the Germanwings co-pilot, who had severe psychiatric issues beyond clinical depression, reportedly requiring injections and a previously disclosed diagnosis to Lufthansa. The author questions how these ""red flags"" were missed despite multiple opportunities for detection. These opportunities included the team-oriented nature of glider flying, Lufthansa's competitive pilot selection process, and the rigorous, constantly supervised ab initio MPL training program (250 hours, costing $76,000), from which Lubitz took an untypical leave.

The passage notes that airline pilots typically compartmentalize stress, and depression is now treatable with FAA-approved medication, allowing pilots to continue flying. It highlights that Lubitz had only 600 flight hours, unlike US pilots who require 1,500 hours. Contributing factors like Germanwings' lower pay and more duty days compared to Lufthansa are also mentioned, creating a ""perfect storm of stress"" for Lubitz. The author concludes by suggesting the incident was preventable and underscores the purpose of accident investigation."
15782,"Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a 23-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Columbus, pleaded not guilty in Ohio to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI, and was remanded into custody. The U.S. Department of Justice alleges Mohamud traveled to Syria in April 2014 for terrorist training, where he learned shooting, breaking into homes, using explosives, and hand-to-hand combat. He was then instructed to return to the United States to commit an act of terrorism. Mohamud allegedly wanted to kill Americans, particularly U.S. soldiers execution-style, and planned to target U.S. armed forces, police, or other uniformed individuals, with specific plans to attack a military facility or a prison. He also allegedly expressed happiness about his brother's death fighting for al-Nusra Front and planned to join him."
15784,"Two deputies involved in the fatal attempt to arrest Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have been reassigned due to threats against them and their families, though they are not charged with a crime. They faced criticism for pinning Harris' head down during the arrest. Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, who shot Harris, is charged with second-degree manslaughter. Sheriff Stanley Glanz apologized to Harris' family, denied allegations of forged training records for Bates, and stated the FBI cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. The sheriff's office has temporarily suspended operations of its drug unit and is reviewing actions, possibly after Bates' court case. Harris' family has demanded justice and policy changes."

The bird family was then taken to a more enclosed grassy area at 16th and L streets NW. Todd described the situation as extraordinary for the middle of the city."
11365,"Since the start of Saudi-led military operations against Yemeni Shia fighters on March 26, over 500 Houthi rebels have been killed, and the nine-nation coalition has conducted 1,200 airstrikes aimed at preventing rebel movement toward southern Yemen. Clashes near the Saudi-Yemeni border resulted in three Saudi military officers killed and two wounded by Houthi mortar rounds. The Yemeni Health Ministry reported 385 civilians killed and 342 wounded, while the World Health Organization cited higher overall figures of 648 killed and 2,191 wounded, including militants. The conflict escalated after Houthi rebels forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January, and most of Yemen's 25 million people required humanitarian assistance even before the airstrikes."
11396,"Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn, who was the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in connection with the church's sex abuse scandal. Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse, specifically concerning priest Shawn Ratigan, who pleaded guilty to child pornography charges. Finn received two years' probation but no jail time or fine, and remained in his position for years after his conviction.

The delay in his resignation was noted by critics, including Cardinal Sean O'Malley and Professor Candida Moss, who suggested it didn't appear urgent. The timing of the announcement may have been influenced by recent criticism Pope Francis faced regarding a bishop appointment in Chile, with Moss suggesting it was a move to restore confidence. Archbishop Joseph Naumann has been appointed as the apostolic administrator for the Kansas City-St. Joseph diocese until a permanent bishop is named. Watchdog groups, while acknowledging Finn's removal as a step, are calling for Pope Francis to issue a more explicit statement confirming a shift in papal practice regarding bishop accountability."

Entrants must consider challenges like limited accessibility and material transport. The island, which earns income from lobster fishing, stamps, and tourism, is also updating existing infrastructure. The competition aims to enhance energy efficiency and modernize structures, with the winner announced in June 2016, pending UK and EU grants."
11428,"The passage covers several political developments:

*   **President Obama's Foreign Policy:** Obama is attending a regional summit in Panama, where a historic face-to-face meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro, the first in decades, is a possibility. The White House is weighing whether such a meeting would generate progress or be a premature reward, as efforts to end the Cuba freeze have been difficult.
*   **Hillary Clinton's Campaign:** Clinton has leased headquarters in Brooklyn and will soon officially launch her presidential campaign. The launch will feature a carefully orchestrated effort to reintroduce her, emphasizing her childhood and early work on children's issues. Her campaign also aims to showcase a large, experienced staff and plans to hold smaller events for personal interaction.
*   **Robert Menendez Indictment:** Beyond personal allegations, the corruption indictment against Senator Robert Menendez includes a charge related to his staff soliciting funds for a super PAC, a potential campaign finance violation. This could lead to increased scrutiny of such practices and potentially reveal impropriety involving other lawmakers.
*   **GOP Presidential Race:** With Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio soon becoming official candidates, pressure is mounting on GOP operatives to choose sides, as evidenced by recent staff signings and outreach from various candidates like Chris Christie, John Kasich, Donald Trump, and Scott Walker."
11430,"Jake Tapper has been named the new anchor of CNN's Sunday morning political interview program ""State of the Union,"" effective June. He will continue his roles as the channel's chief Washington correspondent and anchor of the weekday newscast ""The Lead."" Tapper, who joined CNN in 2013, succeeds Candy Crowley, who departed last December. CNN Worldwide CEO Jeff Zucker expressed confidence in Tapper's qualifications for the prestigious Sunday program, noting his skills as a reporter, storyteller, and interviewer. This move follows similar anchor changes at other networks' Sunday political shows, and Tapper will become one of the few anchors to host both weekday and Sunday morning programs, a role with precedent at CNN."
11773,"Oscar-winning rapper-turned-actor Common has joined the cast of Warner Bros.' ""Suicide Squad,"" an action movie featuring DC Entertainment super-villains. David Ayer is directing the film, which includes Jared Leto, Will Smith, and Margot Robbie among its cast, with possible cameos from Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and Ben Affleck as Batman. The story involves imprisoned villains recruited by a government agency for covert operations. Details about Common's role have not been revealed. The movie is currently in production in Toronto. Common recently appeared in ""Run All Night"" and ""Selma,"" for which he won an Oscar for best original song."
11800,"Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old American aid worker, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike targeting al Qaeda in January, along with Italian aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto. Weinstein had been abducted in 2011 from his home in Lahore, Pakistan, by gunmen posing as neighbors, and al Qaeda later claimed responsibility, demanding an end to U.S. airstrikes.

His family had frantically searched for details and pushed for his release, expressing deep disappointment and heartbreak over his death, and criticizing both the U.S. and Pakistani governments for not doing more to secure his freedom. They stated that his captors were ultimately responsible for his death. U.S. officials, including President Obama, praised Weinstein's lifelong dedication to service and confirmed an independent investigation into the circumstances of his death, noting they were unaware of the hostages' presence at the targeted al Qaeda compound."
11803,"South Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo offered to resign amid a growing political scandal. He will remain in his role until President Park Geun-hye accepts his resignation, having temporarily transferred his Cabinet meeting duties to the deputy prime minister. The scandal stems from the apparent suicide of tycoon Sung Woan-jong, who was under investigation for fraud and bribery and left a note listing names of officials who received cash. Lee and seven other politicians linked to the President are under investigation by a special prosecutor's team. Lee has adamantly denied the allegations. President Park called the resignation ""regrettable"" and has condemned political corruption, stating she takes the accusations very seriously and will not forgive those responsible."
11871,"Corinthian Colleges Inc. announced the shutdown of its remaining 28 campuses, a development seen as positive in holding ""predator colleges"" accountable. These for-profit institutions, which once enrolled over 70,000 students, are criticized for offering dubious degrees, burdening students with high debt, and receiving 86% of their funding from federal student loans. Despite enrolling only 13% of college students, they account for nearly half of all student loan defaults.

For-profit colleges employ aggressive recruitment tactics, convince low-income students to take out large federal loans, and keep costs low with online classes and part-time professors. Their degrees often lead to poor employment prospects, with graduates reportedly earning less than high school dropouts, and their costs are about 60% higher than public colleges. Investigations have revealed widespread rule-breaking, including accepting fictitious diplomas and making phony job-placement claims.

Following a ""debt strike"" by Corinthian graduates, the Education Department signaled a willingness to forgive their loans. The passage advocates for closing remaining for-profit colleges and forgiving debts for students not gainfully employed or transferred to reputable colleges within three years. Enrollment at some large for-profit colleges, like the University of Phoenix, has significantly declined."
11884,"Kabul has transformed, its population swollen by provincial violence, yet its scope has shrunk, reflecting the uneasy legacy of America's longest war. English-speaking Afghans, once valuable to NATO, are now jobless, blacklisted, and fear reprisals, often living in market stalls or on the street. Similarly, truck drivers who supplied NATO are left with devalued vehicles while their bosses fled.

Once-bustling areas like ""poppy palaces,"" Chicken Street, and restaurants are now deserted, though Afghans are reclaiming roads. Large amounts of American war equipment and supply trucks sit idle. Wedding palaces proliferate, and the city's lights remain on, unlike during Taliban rule, but their future is uncertain as the last American troops prepare to retreat."
11885,"A Consumer Reports study, based on 70 million passenger trips over two years, evaluated award-seat availability among the five largest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. Southwest Airlines was the top performer, offering the most award tickets (11.9 million) and the highest percentage (11.5%), attributed to its ""Every Seat is an Award Seat"" policy, no blackout dates, and lack of close-in booking or cancellation fees. JetBlue ranked last with the lowest percentage (4.5%) and fewest award tickets (892,000). Delta, United, and American Airlines placed second, third, and fourth, respectively. The study also noted that award tickets are not free, their value varies by route, and overall customer satisfaction (Southwest highest at 86) and fees (Southwest charges none) are important factors for consumers."
11890,"In June 2012, James Holmes committed a mass shooting at a Colorado cinema during a midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" killing 12 people and injuring 70. Holmes, who appeared Joker-like and wore body armor with multiple weapons, also booby-trapped his apartment.

His legal defense is ""not guilty by reason of insanity,"" with his public defenders arguing he suffered a ""severe mental illness"" and ""psychotic episode"" at the time. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Holmes was a neuroscience doctoral student whose schooling was government-funded. Prior to the shooting, he had told a classmate he wanted to kill people, was a patient of a psychiatrist who raised concerns about his dangerousness, and texted about ""dysphoric mania.""

His parents have publicly requested his life be spared and that he be institutionalized due to his severe mental illness. The trial, involving a large jury, is set to begin, with the jury deciding on 165 counts. A group called ""No Notoriety,"" comprising victims and their relatives, is advocating for media outlets to stop using the names and likenesses of mass killers."
11891,"Prosperity gospel pastor Creflo Dollar recently addressed critics of his campaign to acquire a $65 million Gulfstream G650 jet. In a new video, Dollar claimed the devil was attempting to discredit him and denied directly asking for money for the plane, despite having solicited donations in March for the G650. He stated the need for a new jet arose from two accidents involving his old 1984 plane, which forced him and his staff to fly commercially. His campaign sought $300 from 200,000 people globally to fund the purchase of the G650, a luxury jet capable of carrying 18 passengers and four crew. The ministry's fundraising efforts were met with significant criticism on social media and in nationwide media reports, leading to the removal of the specific fundraising page, though donations are still accepted on the church's gift page."
