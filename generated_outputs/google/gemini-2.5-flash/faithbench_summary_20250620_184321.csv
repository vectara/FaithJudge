Commandos landed on the hospital roof and killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. More than 50 people were wounded in the assault. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban denied any involvement.

The attack, which began at 09:00 local time, marked a change in approach for IS fighters in Afghanistan, being their first direct engagement with security forces in the capital and utilizing tactics previously associated with the Taliban, suggesting expanded resources and military training. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack, stating it ""trampled all human values"" and was an attack on all of Afghanistan."

The six shortlisted authors are Mukherjee (*The Lives Of Others*), Howard Jacobson (*J*), Ali Smith (*How To Be Both*), Joshua Ferris (*To Rise Again at a Decent Hour*), Karen Joy Fowler (*We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves*), and Richard Flanagan (*The Narrow Road to the Deep North*). Mukherjee is the 5/2 favorite, followed by Flanagan at 3/1.

Fowler's *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves* is the best-selling book on the list, and the shortlist announcement significantly boosted sales for all nominated titles. Despite this, one professor of contemporary literature criticized it as a ""weak list,"" favoring Jacobson's *J* but expressing concern about a two-time winner. This is the 46th year of the prize, with shortlisted authors each receiving £2,500 and a specially bound edition of their book. The judging panel is chaired by AC Grayling."
14-2,"Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing he would extend his term by only one year, until 2019, rather than leaving in 2018 as planned or staying until 2021. This decision was primarily personal, driven by his family's desire to return to Canada in 2018 for his daughters' education. While there was speculation about political pressure or disillusionment with economic predictions, Carney stated it was an ""entirely personal decision."" Professionally, he found it difficult to leave in the middle of Brexit negotiations, but his family's plans limited his extension to one year, by which time the Article 50 process should be complete."

Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens announced Gill's death, calling him a ""giant among journalists"" and the ""heart and soul"" of the paper, which he joined in 1993. Gill was known for his incomparable wit, dazzling and fearless writing, and intelligence, often dictating his copy due to dyslexia.

While popular, his articles frequently caused controversy, including shooting a baboon, making offensive comments about the Welsh, Rhyl, Norfolk, and the Isle of Man, and being censured for a comment about Clare Balding. He was also once thrown out of a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.

Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill overcame dyslexia to forge his writing career, starting with art reviews before joining Tatler and then the Sunday Times. He was married twice, to Cressida Connolly and then to Amber Rudd, with whom he had two children. His illness led to his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he had twins."
14-4,"The passage describes several ""virtual warrior"" groups engaged in cyber warfare, capable of making documents public, blocking websites, and hijacking various digital systems. The three most prominent groups are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, Cyber Berkut, and Anonymous International, all claiming to be independent.

The **Ukrainian Cyber Troops**, led by Yevhen Dokukin, are pro-Ukrainian. They claim to have hacked Russian government servers and police emails, with a volunteer group using this data to find evidence of wounded Russian servicemen. They employ distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against rebel websites, target separatist funding, hack CCTV for troop monitoring, and claim to have hijacked printers for pro-Ukrainian messages. Ukrainian officials deny media suggestions that hacker-obtained data is used for artillery fire.

**Cyber Berkut** is an anti-Western group with rhetoric similar to Russian state media, aiming to thwart Ukraine's military plans. They hacked Ukrainian government websites during a US Vice-President's visit, posting anti-Biden messages, and claim to have retrieved confidential documents detailing US military assistance. They also appear to have hacked electronic billboards in Kiev and claim to have disrupted vote-counting systems, leaked defense ministry data, and blocked President Poroshenko's website. An unverified claim attributes to them a hacked Facebook conversation suggesting Ukrainian officials admitted downing MH17.

**Anonymous International** (also known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay) is a Russian activist group known for publishing leaked Kremlin documents, though it's unclear if these are obtained through hacking or from insiders. While primarily focusing on Russian domestic affairs, they have published material related to Ukraine, including a letter from a Russian fighter and emails from a key rebel commander. Their website is currently blocked in Russia."

15-3,"A major study revealed a 17.2% increase in heavy drinking among Americans between 2005 and 2012, primarily due to rising rates among women, who also experienced significantly higher increases in binge drinking compared to men. In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers, though the overall percentage of people consuming alcohol remained unchanged.

The study, conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, defined heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two for men, and binge drinking as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion.

Factors contributing to this rise include changing social norms making it more acceptable for women to drink, alcohol becoming cheaper in real dollars, increased alcohol advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. Alcohol was linked to 88,600 U.S. deaths in 2010, with excessive drinking costing over $220 billion annually."

His mother noted thousands of joins on the Pilgrim Bandits website, 19,000 hits on a Facebook update, increased mail, and hundreds of invitations for Ben to visit places with the torch, all of which have greatly uplifted him.

13-1,"Demelza Poldark has given birth to a baby daughter, with Ross Poldark showing affection for his new family. However, the show's timeline for Demelza's pregnancy is criticized as unrealistic; she goes from barely showing to eight months pregnant, then gives birth, all within minutes of an episode, or between episodes. Fans have noted this accelerated progression, comparing it to a previous rapid pregnancy in the show involving Elizabeth. Despite his popularity, Ross Poldark's heart is depicted as committed to Demelza."
13-2,"New figures reveal that 272 children with foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were hospitalized in England over the past 12 months due to brain damage from alcohol exposure in the womb, according to the official Health and Social Care Information Centre. Experts warn the actual number affected is likely much higher and vastly under-diagnosed. Research by the World Health Organisation suggests at least one in 100 babies born in the UK (approximately 7,500 annually) could suffer learning, behavioral, and physical problems, including deformed limbs, due to alcohol exposure. Children born with FAS do not recover, and other associated medical issues include problems with the liver, kidneys, heart, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. While the government advises pregnant women to limit alcohol consumption, some experts advocate for complete abstinence during pregnancy."
13-3,"The Scottish women's football team has won all five qualifiers and will host unbeaten Iceland, who have won four from four, at Falkirk Stadium on Friday, with a return fixture on September 20. These matches are expected to determine the group winner, though Scotland is in a strong position for automatic qualification as one of the best runners-up if they don't top the group.

Player Evans, a Bayern Munich forward, emphasizes the team's desperation to qualify after previous play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's World Cup, calling it a long-held aim. She believes the experience of 12 squad members playing in competitive leagues abroad, including her own recent Bundesliga win with Bayern, significantly benefits the national team. Evans also noted the importance of a large home crowd."

12-0,"An Omura's whale, a species previously feared extinct and only scientifically described in 2003, was found washed ashore on a remote Exmouth beach in West Australia following Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This marks the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia. The 5.68m juvenile female was identified through DNA profiling. The discovery is considered highly significant by scientists due to the limited knowledge about the species, which is typically found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. This find offers an opportunity to learn more about its regional distribution and improve identification guides. Omura's whales have a sleek body shape and unique skeletal features, including four digits on each pectoral fin. The carcass has been buried, and its skeleton will be recovered in the future for further scientific investigation and potential public display."
