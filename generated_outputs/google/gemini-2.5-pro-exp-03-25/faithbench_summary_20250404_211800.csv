14-0,"Militants attacked the Sardar Daud hospital by detonating explosives at a gate and then opening fire on staff and patients with guns and grenades. Commandos landed on the hospital roof and killed all four attackers after several hours of fighting. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban denied involvement. According to the defence ministry, more than 50 people were wounded. President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attack on the 400-bed hospital. The attack signifies a change in IS tactics in Afghanistan, marking their first direct engagement with security forces in Kabul and using methods previously associated with the Taliban, suggesting potentially expanded resources and training. IS announced its presence in Afghanistan in 2015 and has previously targeted civilians and fought forces mainly in the east. Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack."
14-1,"This passage discusses the upcoming announcement of the 46th Booker Prize winner. It is the first year the prize is open to all authors writing in English, regardless of nationality. Neel Mukherjee's *The Lives Of Others*, set in 1960s Calcutta, is the bookmakers' favorite at 5/2 odds. The shortlist includes three British writers (Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith, and one unnamed), two Americans (Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler), and one Australian (Richard Flanagan).

Key details about some shortlisted books are provided: Jacobson's *J* is a futuristic love story; Smith's *How To Be Both* has interlinking stories; Ferris's *To Rise Again at a Decent Hour* involves atheism and online identity; Fowler's *We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves* focuses on a family with a special child; Flanagan's *The Narrow Road to the Deep North* is a WWII love story. Fowler's book is the best-selling on the list, and the shortlist announcement boosted sales for all nominees.

Criticism of the list includes Professor David Brauner calling it ""weak"" but identifying Jacobson's *J* as the strongest, though suggesting reluctance to award a recent winner again. The judging panel is chaired by AC Grayling. Last year's winner was Eleanor Catton. Shortlisted authors receive £2,500. The winner announcement will be at London's Guildhall and covered by the BBC."
14-2,"Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, surprised many by announcing he would extend his term by only one year, until 2019, rather than leaving in 2018 as originally planned or staying until 2021. This ""third way"" decision was primarily driven by personal family reasons, specifically his daughters reaching educational milestones in 2018, making it an ideal time for the family to return to Canada. While acknowledging the professional difficulty of leaving amidst Brexit negotiations in 2018, Carney felt extending by just one year was manageable. He stated the decision was ""entirely personal"" and unrelated to political pressure, government policy, or criticism of the Bank's economic forecasts. The extension aims to see through the expected completion of the Article 50 process, after which a new Governor will take over."

14-4,"Based on the provided passage:

Three main groups presenting themselves as independent cyber activists are involved in the Ukraine conflict: the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, Cyber Berkut, and Anonymous International. These groups engage in activities like publicizing documents, blocking websites, and hijacking CCTVs, billboards, and printers.

The pro-Ukrainian Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Yevhen Dokukin, claim hacks on Russian targets, providing data allegedly showing Russian military involvement. They use DDoS attacks against rebel websites, disrupt separatist funding via electronic payments, hack CCTVs for surveillance, and hijack printers for propaganda. Ukrainian officials deny using hacker data for military targeting.

Cyber Berkut is an anti-Western group whose rhetoric resembles Russian state media. They aim to thwart Ukraine's military plans. Their claimed actions include hacking Ukrainian government websites during Joe Biden's visit, obtaining documents on US military aid, hijacking Kiev billboards to display graphic content, disrupting elections, leaking Ukrainian military data, and blocking President Poroshenko's website. They also allegedly hacked a conversation suggesting Ukrainian forces downed flight MH17, though this is unverified.

Anonymous International (Shaltay Boltay), a Russian group, primarily leaks documents related to Russian domestic affairs, though some cover Ukraine, such as a letter indicating lack of local support for separatists and alleged emails of a rebel commander. It is unclear if they obtain material via hacking or leaks. Their website is blocked in Russia."

15-3,"Based on the provided passage:

A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found that heavy drinking and binge-drinking increased among Americans between 2005 and 2012, with heavy drinking rising 17.2%. This increase was largely driven by rising rates among women, attributed to changing social norms. In 2012, 8% of Americans were heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers, though the overall percentage of people consuming any alcohol remained stable. The study, the first to track adult drinking at the county level using CDC data, noted significant variations in rates across counties. Factors contributing to the rise include increased social acceptability for women drinking, alcohol becoming relatively cheaper, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. Excessive drinking was linked to approximately 88,600 deaths in 2010 and costs over $220 billion annually. Treatment centers report seeing more people for alcoholism, though many avoid treatment until facing serious consequences."

Castleford responded with three tries in four minutes from Larne Patrick, Luke Gale, and Flynn (completing his hat-trick), making the finish tense. However, Widnes held on. This marked Castleford's fourth consecutive home league defeat. The win moved Widnes to seventh place, one point behind Castleford, who remain sixth.

16-0,"The passage highlights the potential financial and historical significance of the Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao fight, noting that evaluating great fights considers action, context, and expectation. It then focuses on the Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran rivalry as part of a series on boxing history. After Duran won their first fight by a controversial decision, Leonard employed speed and movement in their November 1980 rematch.

He views winning all four majors as the mark of a ""complete player."" McIlroy considers his final-round collapse at the 2011 Masters, where he lost a four-shot lead, the ""most important day of his career"" because he learned significantly from the experience, which helped him win his first major two months later. Despite only one top-10 finish in six Masters appearances, the 25-year-old hopes to win multiple green jackets throughout his career.

16-4,"A three-bedroom maisonette in Knightsbridge, London, is on the market for £575,000, significantly below typical prices for the area. The major catch is that the property has only three years remaining on its lease and requires modernisation. The purchase price equates to roughly £15,000 per month over the lease term, similar to local rental rates, excluding renovation costs. If a buyer extends the lease, which could cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million for 90 years, the modernised 1,990 sq/ft property could be worth upwards of £6 million. A second, larger maisonette on the same street is also available for £595,000 under similar conditions. Despite the high cost of lease extension, the properties have generated significant interest, though experts warn potential buyers about the substantial premium required."

Russian President Putin accused Turkey's government of subservience to the US and ""creeping Islamisation"". Both countries are involved in Syria with differing positions, despite both opposing IS. The Su-24 was downed by Turkish F-16s on November 24. The pilot was killed after ejecting, apparently by militants, while the navigator was rescued. A Russian marine involved in the rescue was also killed. Russia demands an apology from Turkey and has imposed sanctions, including a ban on package holidays potentially costing Turkey billions."
10-2,"An explosion at a chemical plant in Zhangzhou city, Fujian province, China, injured six people and caused a large fire. The blast occurred Monday night at an oil storage facility due to an oil leak. Five of the injured were hurt by broken glass. The plant produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used for polyester production. Over 600 firefighters brought the blaze under control, and local media reported no toxic chemical spill. Residents heard the explosion and felt tremors. The plant experienced a previous explosion in July 2013. The facility had been relocated from Xiamen to Zhangzhou after protests in 2007 due to pollution concerns surrounding PX plants."
10-3,"Davina Ayrton, 34 (formerly David), denied raping a 15-year-old girl in a Portsmouth garage in autumn 2004. The trial took place at Portsmouth Crown Court. The victim testified that the attack occurred while two others slept in the garage, she shouted for Ayrton to stop, and she clearly recalled the events after drinking one and a half cans of Foster's. Ayrton, who has learning difficulties and attempted suicide last summer, changed her name in 2012 and stated she has not made physical changes or taken medication related to her sexuality. In 2014, she told a care home worker about the attack. Judge Ian Pearson remanded Ayrton into custody for sentencing on 4 March, stating she would likely be held in a male prison in Winchester due to being a risk to herself and potentially failing to attend. Protocols are in place for her detention. The judge noted the case was unusual and not easy."
10-4,"Eugene, United States, has been awarded the rights to host the 2021 IAAF World Championships by the IAAF Council. The council bypassed the usual bidding process, viewing it as a unique strategic opportunity to host the event in the USA for the first time. Eugene had previously failed in its bid for the 2019 event, which was awarded to Doha. IAAF President Lamine Diack stated the decision was strategic, citing the combined support of public authorities, the private sector, the US Olympic Committee, NBC, and the public, and the chance to access a key market for the sport's global development. The 2007 World Championships in Osaka were also awarded without a bidding process."
13-0,"L/Bdr Ben Parkinson, who was seriously injured in a bomb attack in Afghanistan in 2006, carried the Olympic torch on June 26th. Despite a brain injury that initially affected his speech (which he now speaks unaided), his nomination highlighted his unchanged personality, sense of humour, intelligence, and wit. He undergoes 12 hours of daily rehab, walks with crutches, and raises money for military charities, including the Pilgrim Bandits.

Since carrying the torch, Parkinson has received thousands of Facebook friend requests, exceeding the site's 5,000 limit for personal pages. His mother, Diane, described the public response as ""phenomenal,"" noting a surge in support, messages, website traffic for Pilgrim Bandits, mail, emails, and requests for visits with the torch. Parkinson is reportedly ""buoyed up"" and ""elated"" by the support. Facebook suggested that individuals receiving such high numbers of requests, like public figures, should consider using a Page or the Subscribe feature instead of a personal profile. A total of 8,000 people are carrying the Olympic flame on its journey to the London Games."
13-1,"In an upcoming episode of the show, Demelza Poldark gives birth to a daughter shortly after the episode begins. Ross Poldark, played by Aidan Turner, gazes lovingly at the baby and tells Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, that she makes him a better man, indicating his feelings despite their duty-based marriage. Ross is described as a heartthrob whose heart is ""off the market."" The passage highlights the unconvincing speed of the pregnancy timeline, jumping from the announcement in the previous episode to Demelza being eight months pregnant and then giving birth minutes later in the next episode. Fans commented on this rapid progression on Twitter, noting it was reminiscent of a previous fast pregnancy involving the character Elizabeth."
13-2,"According to official figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 272 children were hospitalized in England last year due to brain damage caused by foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) resulting from alcohol exposure in the womb. Experts suggest the actual number affected could be significantly higher. Research by the World Health Organisation indicates that potentially 1 in 100 babies born in the UK (around 7,500 annually) might suffer learning, behavioural, or physical problems due to alcohol exposure. Elizabeth Mitchell of the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome states the condition is permanent and vastly under-diagnosed. The passage mentions a 15-year-old girl with FAS who needs help with daily tasks and cannot live independently. Other health issues associated with alcohol use during pregnancy include liver, kidney, and heart problems, cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy. Current government advice is for pregnant women not to drink, or to limit consumption to a maximum of two units no more than twice a week, but Ms. Mitchell believes the guidance should recommend complete abstinence."
13-3,"Scotland's women's football team has won all five qualifiers and faces a crucial home match against Iceland. A victory would virtually secure their place in a major tournament, a goal player Lisa Evans is desperate to achieve after previous play-off losses for Euro 2013 and the World Cup. Iceland, ranked slightly higher and also unbeaten, presents a significant challenge, with the matches between the two likely deciding the group winner. Scotland is well-positioned to qualify automatically, potentially even as a runner-up. Evans, who plays for Bayern Munich and recently won the Bundesliga, is one of 12 players in the 20-strong squad based outside Scotland. She believes playing in competitive foreign leagues enhances the national team by bringing diverse experiences and higher standards."
13-4,"A light general aviation aircraft landed without its landing gear deployed at Aero Acres residential airpark in Fort Pierce, Florida. Video footage shows the Aerostar plane skidding on its belly along the runway, with its propellers hitting the ground. The pilot then re-engaged the engines and took off again. The video maker observed the lack of landing gear just before touchdown and commented on the propeller impact. The pilot, identified as 85-year-old Chris Georgaklis who has flown for almost 50 years, subsequently flew 100 miles to Fort Lauderdale and landed safely with his dog, Buddy. The passage notes that gear-up landings are often caused by human error or mechanical failure, and the FAA is investigating the incident."

12-0,"An Omura's whale, a species previously feared extinct, washed up on a remote Exmouth beach in West Australia after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn. This is the first sighting of the species in WA and the second in Australia. The 5.68m juvenile female was initially difficult to identify but was confirmed using DNA profiling.

The discovery is considered highly significant for scientists as very little is known about the species, which was first described in 2003 and is usually found in tropical/subtropical waters like Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan. Knowledge gained from this specimen will help improve field identification guides and understand the whale's distribution. Omura's whales have a sleek body, 53 vertebrae, and four digits on each pectoral fin (though another part of the passage mentions 60 vertebrae). The skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific study and possible museum display."
12-1,"Conor McGregor is preparing for a featherweight title fight against Jose Aldo in Las Vegas on July 11. Ahead of the match, McGregor unveiled a new tattoo of a tiger's face on his stomach, adding to an existing tattoo of a gorilla eating a heart on his chest. He shared the new artwork on Instagram. This fight marks Aldo's eighth defense of his belt. McGregor claims he possesses greater motivation than Aldo, citing an incident during a promotional tour in Dublin where McGregor grabbed Aldo's belt. The passage notes they have a fractious relationship."
12-3,"A magnitude-4.8 earthquake struck at a depth of 15.5km, 35km north of Lucca, Italy, with its epicentre in Garfagnana, according to officials and Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV). The tremor occurred at 15:48 (14:48 GMT) and was felt as far away as Milan, Florence, Bologna, and Modena. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, although phone lines and power were cut in the Garfagnana area, people exited buildings in Lucca, and schools were evacuated as a precaution. Several aftershocks followed. An INGV official described the quake as ""medium-strong,"" ""fairly shallow,"" and typical for the area. The passage notes Italy is prone to earthquakes, referencing the deadly 2009 L'Aquila quake (almost 300 deaths) and the subsequent manslaughter conviction of scientists and an official for providing falsely reassuring statements beforehand. It also mentions two earthquakes the previous May in the same area, the strongest being magnitude-6, which killed over 20 people."
12-4,"According to her grandmother Cissy Houston, Bobbi Kristina Brown, the daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, has ""global and irreversible brain damage."" Although no longer in a medically induced coma, she remains unresponsive and could live in this condition for a lifetime. A source confirmed her unchanged neurological state over nearly three months, her unresponsiveness to stimuli, and that she has a tracheostomy.

This contrasts with statements from her father, Bobby Brown, who recently said she was ""awake"" and ""watching"" him, remarks made while he was reportedly in an ""emotional state."" An attorney for the Brown family stated her condition has improved, doctors predict a long life, but she is starting a long rehabilitation process, and her future quality of life is unknown. Bobby Brown's wife added that Bobbi Kristina is out of ICU and has opened her eyes."
