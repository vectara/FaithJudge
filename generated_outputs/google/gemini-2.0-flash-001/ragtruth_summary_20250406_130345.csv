15777,"Airline pilots are generally good at compartmentalizing stress, and depression is treatable and no longer career-ending due to FAA-approved medication. However, the case of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who had psychiatric issues beyond clinical depression, raises questions. Despite the rigorous selection and training process at Lufthansa and Germanwings, red flags regarding Lubitz's mental health were seemingly missed, including a leave of absence during training and a reported disclosure of previous depression. The author questions how, given the close interactions in aviation and the stressful conditions at Germanwings, no one recognized the severity of Lubitz's issues, suggesting the tragedy might have been preventable.

While Finn's removal is seen as a positive step, some call for Pope Francis to explicitly state that the removal was due to Finn's failure to prioritize child safety.
