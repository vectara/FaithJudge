14-0,"Based on the passage provided, militants armed with guns and grenades attacked the Sardar Daud hospital in Kabul. The assault began when one attacker detonated explosives at a gate, allowing the group to enter and open fire on staff and patients. After several hours, commandos landed on the hospital roof and killed all four attackers.

The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack, while the Taliban denied involvement. The defence ministry reported that more than 50 people were wounded. The passage notes that this attack marks a change in approach for IS in Afghanistan, as it was the first time they directly engaged with security forces in the capital. The method used, blowing open a gate to allow gunmen entry, is described as being more commonly associated with the Taliban and suggests IS may have the resources and training to expand its attacks."
14-1,"Based on the passage, the Booker Prize is in its 46th year and, for the first time, is open to all authors writing in English regardless of nationality. The winner will be announced on Tuesday night at London's Guildhall.

14-2,"Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, announced he would extend his term by one year, a ""third way"" between the two expected options of leaving in 2018 or staying until 2021. The decision was described as ""entirely personal"" and was primarily driven by family circumstances. In 2018, one of his daughters will be finishing A-levels and another her GCSEs, making it a ""perfect moment"" for his family to return to Canada. While Carney felt it would be difficult to leave in the middle of Brexit negotiations, he only felt able to extend his stay by one year.

His final column was about his diagnosis. Known for dictating his copy due to dyslexia, Gill's articles were often controversial, leading to outrage and censure for comments about the Welsh, Clare Balding, and his shooting of a baboon.

They have hacked Ukrainian government websites and electronic billboards, and claim to have disrupted election systems, leaked Ukrainian defense ministry data, and retrieved confidential documents from a member of US Vice-President Joe Biden's team. They also allegedly hacked a Facebook conversation regarding flight MH17, a claim that was unverified.

15-3,"Based on a study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, heavy drinking and binge-drinking are on the rise among Americans. The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, found that heavy drinking increased by 17.2% between 2005 and 2012, an increase largely driven by women's drinking habits. The rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men over the decade.

The passage defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day for women and two for men, while binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more for men on a single occasion. In 2012, 8% of Americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18% were binge drinkers.

Potential reasons cited for the increase include changing social norms making it more acceptable for women to drink, the influx of affluent professionals, alcohol becoming cheaper in real dollars, increased advertising, and weakened alcohol control policies. This was the first study to track adult drinking patterns at the county level, analyzing data from 3.7 million Americans."

16-4,"A three-bedroom, ""unmodernised"" maisonette in Knightsbridge, London, is on the market for £575,000. The property's low price is due to a catch: it has only three years left on its lease and is in need of renovation. The cost is equivalent to local rental rates of about £15,000 per month.

If a buyer extends the lease, the property could be worth upwards of £6 million, but a 90-year lease extension is estimated to cost between £3.35 and £4.5 million. A second, larger maisonette is also for sale on the same street for £595,000 with a three-year lease.

After carrying the torch, he received thousands of Facebook friend requests, exceeding the site's 5,000-friend limit for a personal page. He spends 12 hours a day in rehab, walks with crutches, and raises money for military charities, including the Pilgrim Bandits.

13-1,"In an upcoming episode, Demelza Poldark gives birth to a daughter with Ross Poldark. Although Ross may have married Demelza out of duty, he tells her she makes him a better man. The passage criticizes the pregnancy's timeline as unconvincing, noting that the previous episode ended with the pregnancy announcement, while the next one begins with Demelza being eight months pregnant and giving birth just minutes later. This rapid timeline was noticed by fans on Twitter and is described as being reminiscent of a previous pregnancy on the show, where the character Elizabeth went to full term between two episodes."
13-2,"According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 272 children disabled by foetal alcohol syndrome were hospitalized in England over the past 12 months, though experts warn the actual number could be far greater. Research by the World Health Organisation suggests that one in 100 babies in the UK, or about 7,500 annually, could suffer from learning, behavioral, and physical problems due to alcohol exposure.

Elizabeth Mitchell of the National Organisation for Foetal Alchol Syndrome states that the condition is permanent and vastly under-diagnosed. Other medical issues associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy include problems with the liver, kidneys, and heart, as well as cerebral palsy, sight loss, and epilepsy.

The government advises pregnant women not to drink, but if they do, the recommended maximum is up to two units no more than twice a week. Ms. Mitchell believes this guidance should be changed to advise women not to drink at all during pregnancy."
13-3,"The undefeated Scottish women's football team has won all five of its qualifiers and faces a crucial match against Iceland, who are also undefeated. According to player Lisa Evans, a victory would all but secure Scotland's place in the finals, and the team is desperate to qualify after suffering play-off losses for Euro 2013 and the last World Cup. The results of the two matches between Scotland and Iceland will likely decide the group winner. Evans, a 24-year-old forward for Bayern Munich, is one of 12 players in the 20-strong squad who play for clubs outside Scotland. She believes the experience players gain in top foreign leagues benefits the national team by introducing different playing styles and cultures."

12-0,"An Omura's whale, a species that was feared to be extinct, washed up on a beach in Exmouth, West Australia, after tropical cyclone Olwyn. The 5.68m juvenile female was difficult to identify but was eventually confirmed with DNA profiling. This is the first sighting of the species in West Australia and the second in Australia.

The find is considered ""highly significant"" because the species was only described in 2003 and is not well understood. Omura's whales are usually found in tropical and subtropical waters like those of Indonesia, the Philippines, and the Sea of Japan.
