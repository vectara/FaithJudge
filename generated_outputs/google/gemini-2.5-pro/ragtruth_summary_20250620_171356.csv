15599,"Based on the passage provided, Blue Bell has temporarily closed its manufacturing plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, after listeria was found in a serving of ice cream produced there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned consumers not to eat 3-ounce Blue Bell products from that plant marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S, or T.

This action is related to a listeria outbreak at a Kansas hospital where five people were infected and three died. Listeria found in an ice cream cup at the hospital and in samples from the Oklahoma plant were a genetic match to each other, but did not appear to match the listeria from the infected patients. In a separate Texas outbreak, listeria from patients did match samples from Blue Bell products. The CDC states that the investigation to determine if the illnesses are related to the ice cream is ongoing.

Blue Bell has also recalled other products made at a Texas plant. The company notes this is the first recall in its 108-year history and that it does not include half gallons, pints, or quarts."
15601,"Based on the provided passage, a review by Columbia Journalism School found that a Rolling Stone article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia (UVA) was an ""institutional failure"" encompassing reporting, editing, and fact-checking, leading to an apology from the magazine.

The passage then analyzes the potential for defamation lawsuits. The elements of libel in Virginia are the publication of a false and defamatory statement with requisite intent.

*   **UVA:** As a governmental entity, the university cannot sue for defamation.
*   **Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity:** A fraternity is a group, and groups generally cannot sue for defamation. However, an exception exists for a ""comparatively small group"" where the defamatory statement is imputed to all members. Phi Kappa Psi could argue this exception applies, while Rolling Stone could argue the group is too large and fluid for individual members to claim injury.
*   **Other Fraternities:** As a larger group not directly implicated, they would have a harder time bringing a lawsuit.

For a successful suit, individual members would need to prove the false statements harmed their reputation and that Rolling Stone was negligent. They would also need to show tangible damages. The passage concludes that while UVA cannot sue, the fraternity members might have a rare, successful defamation case if they can overcome these legal hurdles."
15604,"Based on the passage, the author, who was the first woman and person of color elected to the Kentucky State Senate, critiques Rand Paul's presidential campaign announcement. She argues that while Paul claims to have a message of inclusion to expand the Republican party, his record and policies contradict this. The author cites Paul's questioning of the Civil Rights Act, his desire to eliminate the Department of Education, his goal to limit women's choices, and his opposition to protections for DREAMers. She interprets his slogan ""take our country back"" as a desire to reverse decades of progress. The author also describes his outreach efforts as ""condescending"" and ""inept,"" concluding that his views are outdated, outside the mainstream, and disqualifying for a president."
15613,"Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau and her husband, Vili Fualaau, are still together and will celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. Their relationship began in 1996 when she was a 34-year-old teacher and he was her 13-year-old student, which led to her serving over seven years in prison. They married after her release in 2005 and have two teen daughters.

In an upcoming ABC ""20/20"" interview, Letourneau Fualaau, now 53, will discuss their marriage, her plans to teach again, and her desire to have her registered sex offender status lifted. Vili Fualaau, now 31, will discuss his experiences with alcoholism and depression and his belief that the system failed him as a minor."
15616,"Kanye West settled a civil lawsuit with photographer Daniel Ramos, whom West had assaulted at Los Angeles International Airport in July 2013. For the incident, West had previously pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge and was sentenced to two years' probation, anger management, and community service. The civil suit, filed by Ramos and his lawyer Gloria Allred, was settled before its trial date. Allred stated that the settlement details were not disclosed, but an important aspect was an apology from West to Ramos, after which the two shook hands. Allred said the case sent a message that celebrities are not above the law. The passage also notes that in a separate 2014 incident, West was accused of assault and reached a civil settlement to avoid criminal charges."
15617,"B.B. King, an 89-year-old blues legend, was hospitalized for dehydration caused by his Type II diabetes. According to his daughter, Claudette King, and a statement from King himself, he was feeling ""much better"" and was released from the hospital on a Tuesday to rest at home. The passage also notes that B.B. stands for Blues Boy, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, has 30 Grammy nominations, and names his Gibson guitars Lucille. Last year, he canceled a tour after suffering from dehydration and exhaustion."
15623,"Indiana Pacers player Chris Copeland and his companion, Katrine Saltara, were stabbed early Wednesday morning in New York. According to the 1OAK nightclub, the incident occurred down the street from their venue in front of the Fulton Houses project, not at the club itself. The club's statement says their staff assisted Copeland after he returned for help and that his driver detained the suspect, who is now in police custody. Copeland suffered knife wounds to his elbow and abdomen and is in stable condition.

Two Atlanta Hawks players, Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha, were arrested at the scene on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct. Police confirmed they were not involved in the stabbing. A 1OAK spokesperson stated the two players went outside to check on Copeland and were arrested after pushing through the crowd that had gathered."
15627,"Based on the passage, the family of Tejano star Selena is creating a ""walking, talking, singing and dancing digital embodiment"" of her, 20 years after her death. The project, called ""Selena the One,"" is being handled by the tech company Acrovirt LLC, and Selena will be the first figure to use their technology. Her sister, Suzette Quintanilla, stated the project is meant to help Selena's legacy grow and is a ""step forward"" from previous holograms of artists like Michael Jackson and Tupac Shakur. The plan is for the digital figure to release new music, collaborate with current artists, and tour in 2018. An Indiegogo campaign is being launched to raise $500,000 for the project."
15628,"A ramp agent for Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines, fell asleep in the cargo hold of Flight 448 from Seattle to Los Angeles. Shortly after takeoff, the pilot and passengers heard banging and yelling coming from the cargo hold. A federal air marshal on board responded by banging back and yelling to the person.

The pilot made an emergency landing after being in the air for 14 minutes. The agent was found unharmed, as the cargo hold is pressurized and temperature-controlled. He was taken to a hospital as a precaution, passed a drug test, and was discharged. According to the airline, the man's co-workers believed he had finished his shift and gone home. The flight, with 170 passengers and six crew members, later continued on to Los Angeles."
15634,"Emy Afalava, a veteran born in the U.S. territory of American Samoa, has been denied U.S. citizenship and the right to vote. The passage argues this contradicts the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to those born in the United States. Afalava and other American Samoans are seeking to gain citizenship through a federal lawsuit.

The passage compares their situation to historical precedents rooted in racial discrimination. These include the *Dred Scott* case, which denied citizenship to African-Americans before being overturned by the 14th Amendment, and the 1904 case of Isabel Gonzalez. In Gonzalez's case, the Supreme Court, influenced by racist views of ""tropical peoples,"" ruled that Puerto Ricans were not aliens but declined to declare them citizens. The passage concludes by stating that inhabitants of all other U.S. island territories have since become citizens, leaving American Samoans as the last group awaiting this right."
15638,"Sisters Iman and Siham Hashi, who form the musical duo Faarrow, were born in Mogadishu, Somalia, but fled to Canada as refugees in 1991. Now based in Los Angeles, they are recording their debut album with producer Elijah Kelley for Warner Brothers Records. They describe their sound as an Afro-pop fusion of pop, hip hop, and African percussion, and they co-write their own music. In addition to their musical careers, the sisters are involved in humanitarian work with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as spokespersons. They also started a socially conscious brand called ""Wish Creatively,"" which sells jewelry to fund projects providing sustainable income for women in Kenya and Somalia."
15651,"At a Mass commemorating the 100th anniversary of the deaths of over one million Armenians at the hands of the Turks, Pope Francis referred to the event as ""the first genocide of the 20th century."" He did so by quoting a 2001 document from Pope John Paul II. The passage notes that previous popes had been more cautious with the term; John Paul II used it only in that written document, while Pope Benedict XVI avoided it.

According to the text, Francis's decision to quote his predecessor was driven by the Vatican's emphasis on ""continuity"" and to signal that this was not a new policy. Despite this, Turkey reacted angrily, recalling its Vatican ambassador and calling the Pope's use of the word ""unacceptable."" The passage presents this event as an example of Pope Francis's willingness to engage in geopolitics, contrasting with his often merciful image. Following the incident, Francis encouraged priests to speak frankly and without fear."
15652,"During National Park Week, which runs from April 18 to April 26, the 128 national parks that typically charge a fee will offer free admission on Saturday and Sunday. Hosted by the National Park Service and the National Park Foundation, the week features activities like astronomy parties, Revolutionary War programs, and Junior Ranger activities. The passage suggests visiting FindYourPark.com to find local parks and www.nationalparkweek.org for more ideas. Visitors are encouraged to share their stories using the hashtag #FindYourPark and on FindYourPark.com."
15661,"Based on the passage, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) deployed two robotic probes into the Fukushima nuclear plant to assess damage from the 2011 disaster. The first robot, sent on April 10, broke down after being blocked by a fallen object but had already collected data from 14 of 18 locations. A second robot, deployed on April 15, successfully collected data from all 11 of its scheduled points. This second probe detected lower-than-expected radiation and temperature levels and captured images of a yellow discoloration on a grating and a strange green glow that was not visible from other angles. The robots are necessary because radiation levels remain too high for humans. TEPCO considers the data a step forward for the decommissioning work, which is estimated to cost $50 billion."
15665,"Based on the passage, the victim impact phase of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial has begun, where a jury must decide if he should receive a life or death sentence for the Boston Marathon bombing. The prosecution presented testimony from victims and their families to show the toll of the attacks.

William A. Campbell Sr. testified about his deceased 29-year-old daughter, Krystle, calling her the ""light of my life."" The other deceased victims were identified as Lingzi Lu, 8-year-old Martin Richard, and Sean Collier. Survivors also testified, including Gillian Reny, who described the chaos and a severe leg injury, and Celeste Corcoran, who lost both legs and detailed the immense pain and ongoing daily struggles of being a double amputee.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini contrasted this testimony with an image of Tsarnaev in a holding cell raising his middle finger, describing him as ""unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged."" Pellegrini also stated that Tsarnaev had called his victims ""innocents"" in a note he wrote while hiding from police."
15667,"Based on the passage, the 50th anniversary of the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards was held in 2015 at the Dallas Cowboys stadium and set a Guinness World Record for the largest audience for a live TV awards show.

The article breaks down the event into ""best"" and ""worst"" moments. The best moments included performances by Eric Church & Keith Urban, Reba McEntire, Garth Brooks, and Jason Aldean; Miranda Lambert's award wins; Taylor Swift's mother presenting her with an award; and a duet by Christina Aguilera and Rascal Flatts.

The worst moments cited were the show's three-and-a-half-hour length, a long segment featuring Tony Romo, rushed Milestone Awards for country legends, Steven Tyler's facial hair, and Twitter criticism of Taylor Swift for attending after her move to pop music."
15670,"Based on the passage, Polish Prince Jan Zylinski challenged Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), to a duel over Farage's complaints about immigrants. In a YouTube video, Zylinski, holding his father's sword, proposed a sword duel in Hyde Park to resolve the matter. As an alternative, he suggested a televised debate.

A spokesman for Farage stated that he would not accept the sword duel and commented that it was a ""tragedy for Poland that it's lost so many of its brightest and best young people."" The passage does not say if Farage responded to the debate offer.

Zylinski challenged Farage because he was ""fed up with discrimination against Poles"" and cited Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams. Zylinski also posted a video highlighting Polish contributions to Britain, including their role in the Battle of Britain and their work ethic. The passage notes that UKIP wants Britain to leave the EU to control its borders and end the free movement of labor."
15673,"A small plane crash killed seven people, including Illinois State University (ISU) associate men's basketball coach Torrey Ward and deputy athletic director Aaron Leetch. The Cessna 414 was returning from the NCAA tournament final in Indianapolis when it crashed near the Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington. The identities of the other five people on the aircraft were not immediately known.

Torrey Ward, a former professional player, became an assistant coach at ISU before the 2012 season and was promoted to associate head coach in 2014. Aaron Leetch returned to ISU as deputy director of athletics in June 2013 after previously working at the university and serving as director of athletics at Whitworth University. ISU President Larry Dietz and Athletic Director Larry Lyons expressed profound grief over the loss of their colleagues."
15683,"Based on the passage, this is a summary of the third day of the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found guilty of the Boston Marathon bombing. The jury must decide between the death penalty and life in prison.

The prosecution presented testimony from survivors to portray Tsarnaev as remorseless. Survivors shared their stories:
*   **Steve Woolfenden** described being severely injured while holding his 3-year-old son's stroller. His son, Leo, was also injured. Woolfenden later saw 8-year-old Martin Richard, who appeared fatally injured, and his mother, Denise, pleading with him.
*   **Heather Abbott** was thrown into a restaurant by a blast and, after three attempts to save her foot, chose to have her leg amputated below the knee.
*   **Marc Fucarile** lost his right leg, suffered severe burns, and may also lose his left leg. He takes over 70 pills a day to cope with his injuries.
*   **Dr. David King**, a trauma surgeon, testified that the injuries were similar to those in war zones. He explained that Martin Richard died from rapid blood loss and likely felt excruciating pain.

The defense, led by Judy Clarke, is expected to call witnesses to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing. The passage also notes that Martin Richard's parents are opposed to the death penalty."
15690,"Based on the passage, actress Sofia Vergara is in a legal battle with her ex-fiancé, Nick Loeb, over two frozen female embryos they created via in vitro fertilization. Loeb filed a lawsuit to prevent Vergara from destroying the embryos, stating he wants to bring them to term using a surrogate. He has offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities from Vergara, arguing that life begins at fertilization.

The lawsuit was initially filed anonymously and also names the Art Reproductive Center in Beverly Hills as a defendant. Vergara's representatives declined to comment. The passage notes that the couple had previously tried unsuccessfully to have children with two surrogate mothers. According to legal experts cited in the text, courts typically decide ownership of embryos in cases of disagreement, and this lawsuit raises complex legal and ethical issues in a ""gray area of law."" One attorney mentioned that a California court is unlikely to allow the destruction of embryos if both parties disagree."
15693,"Sissa Abu Dahou, a 65-year-old woman from Luxor, Egypt, has dressed as a man for 43 years to support her family. After her husband died when she was 21 and pregnant, she adopted male dress, a jalabiya, to work in a conservative society. She worked first as a brick maker and then as a shoe shiner to raise her daughter, Houda. After her story was featured on television, the governor of Luxor offered her a kiosk, and the President of Egypt named her one of the country's ""ideal mothers."" Dahou continues to wear male attire, stating she feels ""suffocated"" in women's clothing."
15695,"After deliberating for over 35 hours, a jury convicted former NFL star Aaron Hernandez of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd. In a televised interview, jurors described the months-long trial as an ""incredibly emotional toll"" and nothing like television shows. They were struck by the ""viciousness"" of the six gunshots and Hernandez's ""indifference,"" citing evidence that he was sunbathing with co-defendants hours after the slaying. Jurors stated that Hernandez's status as a football player did not influence their decision and that it did not matter whether he actually pulled the trigger. The conviction resulted in a sentence of life in prison without parole for the 25-year-old. Two co-defendants, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, will be tried separately."
15696,"Based on the passage, SkyWest Airlines Flight 5622, traveling from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York. A passenger, Larry Johnson, recalled a flight attendant announcing a pressurization problem and described feeling fear and physical symptoms, as did his girlfriend. A nurse on board, Mary Cunningham, treated two passengers who were losing consciousness before she also felt lightheaded.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initially reported a pressurization problem but later issued a statement that did not reference it. A SkyWest spokeswoman stated that three passengers reported losing consciousness and 15 were examined at the airport, with none being hospitalized. She also said that maintenance found no indication of a pressurization problem and the airline continues to investigate. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is gathering information on the incident. The plane, with 84 people on board, descended 28,000 feet in three minutes."
15700,"Based on the passage, Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriots tight end, was convicted of the first-degree murder of Odin Lloyd and sentenced to life in prison without parole. He was also found guilty of unlawful firearm and ammunition possession. During the trial, Hernandez displayed an arrogant and unremorseful demeanor, which the author notes was a focus for many but argues that the jury correctly based its guilty verdict on the ""damning mountain of circumstantial evidence.""

The passage recounts Hernandez's history, noting his life became ""complicated"" after his father's death when he was 16. Despite a successful college football career at the University of Florida, he had off-field troubles, including fights and failed drug tests, and was labeled a ""troubled player"" when drafted. The author praises the Patriots for releasing Hernandez hours after he was charged and the NFL for not defending his character. The passage concludes that it was impossible to predict Hernandez would become a murderer and quotes a law enforcement source who described Hernandez's reaction to his conviction as nonchalant, saying, ""It is what it is."""
15702,"Louis Jordan, 37, was rescued by the crew of the container ship *Houston Express* after being lost at sea for 66 days. A few days into a fishing trip from Conway, South Carolina, a storm capsized his 35-foot sailboat, breaking its mast and his shoulder. The boat would capsize two more times before his rescue. To survive after his food and water ran out, Jordan collected rainwater and caught fish with a hand net after discovering they were attracted to his laundry as it rinsed in the sea.

Upon rescue, Jordan was in ""surprisingly good condition,"" able to walk and mentally aware, though he was dehydrated and hungry. His father, Frank Jordan, had reported him missing on January 29 and explained that his son's good condition was likely due to spending most of his time in the boat's cabin, out of the sun. The Coast Guard found no reason to doubt his story."
15708,"Based on the passage, French prosecutor Brice Robin and a French Gendarmerie spokesman, Lt. Col. Jean-Marc Menichini, denied the existence or use of any cell phone video from the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash. This contradicts reports from magazines *Bild* and *Paris Match*, which claimed to have viewed a video from the wreckage showing the final moments inside the cabin.

The passage also details the investigation into co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who is accused of deliberately crashing the plane. Lufthansa, the parent company of Germanwings, confirmed it knew Lubitz had a ""previous episode of severe depression,"" which he disclosed to his flight school in 2009. Medical records also revealed he had suffered from suicidal tendencies before his aviation career. Investigators believe a possible motive was Lubitz's fear of losing his pilot's license due to his medical condition.

At the crash site, where all 150 people on board were killed, recovery efforts were underway to find remains and personal belongings, with the French President stating that victims could be identified by the end of the week using DNA analysis."
15714,"A fire occurred on a nuclear submarine being repaired in a dry dock at the Zvyozdochka shipyard in northwestern Russia. The rubber insulation between the submarine's hulls caught fire, reportedly during welding work. According to a shipyard spokesman, the submarine's nuclear fuel had been unloaded, and there were no armaments or other dangerous materials on board. No one was injured, and the fire was reported to pose no threat to people or the shipyard."
15733,"According to the passage, Scientologist John Travolta has not seen the HBO documentary ""Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief"" and does not want to. He stated that his 40-year experience with the church has been positive, and he believes the documentary is based on the accounts of ""disgruntled"" people. Travolta said he has not experienced the negative things claimed and credited Scientology with helping him survive the death of his son, Jett, in 2009. The passage also notes that Travolta's wife, Kelly Preston, is a member and that the documentary is based on a book by Lawrence Wright and is critical of the organization."
15735,"During an Exotic Driving Experience event at the Walt Disney World Speedway on a Sunday, a Lamborghini crashed into a guardrail. The passenger, 36-year-old Gary Terry, died at the scene. The driver, 24-year-old Tavon Watson, lost control of the vehicle and was hospitalized with minor injuries. Petty Holdings, the operator of the event, released a statement extending sympathies to those involved."
15739,"According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), a gastrointestinal illness has affected 100 people on the cruise ship Celebrity Infinity. The afflicted include 95 of the 2,117 passengers and five of the 964 crew members. The cause of the illness, which involves symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea, has not yet been determined by the CDC. Two CDC staffers are scheduled to meet the ship in San Diego. Celebrity Cruises has responded by increasing cleaning, keeping passengers informed, and collecting specimens for testing. This is the third gastrointestinal illness outbreak on the ship, with others occurring in 2006 and 2013."
15740,"In a French chalk quarry near Naours, almost 2,000 inscriptions from World War I soldiers have been discovered in a vast underground city. Photographer Jeff Gusky has been chronicling the graffiti, which includes the names, ranks, and hometowns of soldiers, primarily Australian and British, with 55 identified as American.

The underground city, which dates back centuries, was used as a refuge by soldiers fighting nearby, including at the Battle of the Somme. The site was privately owned and largely inaccessible until 2013, when a consortium of villages purchased the rights to operate it and promote its history. The discovery of the inscriptions has been a slow process due to the site's darkness and maze-like extensiveness. Gusky notes that the graffiti provides a human connection, observing that one soldier who signed his name was killed in battle a month later."
15744,"Based on the passage, a *Rolling Stone* article about a purported gang rape at the University of Virginia (UVA) was retracted due to journalistic failures. The writer did not contact friends of the accuser, ""Jackie,"" who would have contradicted her story.

Despite the retraction of this central narrative, the article highlighted an undisputed issue: UVA's handling of sexual assault. The university is under two separate investigations—one by the Virginia attorney general and another by the U.S. Department of Education—over its practices. The passage notes that UVA had never expelled a student for sexual assault, a fact the university admitted after the article's publication, leading it to institute an undefined ""zero-tolerance"" policy.

The article sparked a broader conversation about a campus culture described as insensitive to victims, where students used euphemisms for rape and some fraternities had reputations for being ""rapey."" However, the retraction has led to concerns that progress has been set back, with survivors potentially becoming more afraid to come forward. Some also criticized the original article's focus on a sensational story, suggesting it misrepresents the more common experiences of assault and devalues other survivors' stories."
15747,"Jia Jiang, after his tech start-up was declined for investment, created a project called ""100 Days of Rejection"" to confront his fear. This involved making 100 unusual requests of strangers. One request, for five interlinked donuts from a Krispy Kreme, was unexpectedly fulfilled, and a video of the event went viral, leading to media appearances and speaking engagements. This experience led Jiang to write the book *Rejection Proof*. The goal of his project was to overcome his own fears and help others by demystifying rejection and turning it into an opportunity. The passage concludes with eight of Jiang's tips for making rejection work for you, such as understanding that rejection is a numbers game, asking ""why"" after a ""no,"" and remembering that rejection is an opinion."
15753,"Over the last year, more than 25,000 people have been infected with Ebola, resulting in over 10,000 deaths. This public health emergency revealed flaws in government systems. While the epidemic's intensity has decreased and initial predictions of over a million infections did not occur, dozens are still newly infected each week. In the week of April 5, there were 30 new confirmed cases, the lowest weekly total since May 2014.

Progress on stopping the virus is mixed. In Liberia and Sierra Leone, cases have fallen so much that the WHO is decommissioning surplus treatment facilities. However, in Guinea, post-mortem Ebola diagnoses and unsafe burials are still occurring. A WHO report states that while surveillance is improving, these factors indicate that unknown chains of transmission could cause new infections."
15759,"Based on the passage, the author reflects on the video of Officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott, arguing that while a bystander's video is crucial for justice, a police body camera could have prevented the tragedy. The author posits that an officer aware of being recorded would be less likely to use excessive force or falsify a report. The passage acknowledges the high cost of body cameras but states it is outweighed by the value of a human life and the potential damages from civil suits. Body cameras are presented as a tool to de-escalate tensions between police and communities, as studies show they reduce use-of-force incidents. The author identifies the deeper issue as racial bias against black men in the criminal justice system, describing body cameras as an ""interim solution"" that puts a ""bright spotlight"" on this bias. While long-term solutions like better police screening, training, and broad social change are needed, the author concludes that equipping police with body cameras is an immediate step that can be taken."
15778,"The Shariya refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan houses thousands of Yazidis who fled an ISIS assault on the town of Sinjar. The passage details the experience of one family: Ahlam, her three children, and her in-laws were taken captive by ISIS. Men were given a choice to convert to Islam or be shot, while young women and girls were sold as slaves. Ahlam's family was moved between locations and forced to work. While captive, Ahlam found a phone and secretly contacted her husband, Mahmoud, who had thought his family was dead. After witnessing extreme brutality and fearing they would be next after the elderly were taken away, Ahlam and her group escaped at midnight, eventually reaching Iraqi Kurdistan and reuniting with Mahmoud after eight months.

Shortly after, ISIS released 217 captives, including Mahmoud's parents, though Ahlam's parents remain with ISIS. A Yazidi member of parliament, Vian Dakhil, speculates ISIS released those they struggled to care for and is pleading for international support. Ahlam believes she was spared from being used as a sex slave because she was breastfeeding, which is said to have made her ""impure."" She remains haunted by the memory of other girls and young women being dragged away by ISIS fighters."
15779,"On Thursday in Karachi, Pakistan, Debra Lobo, a 55-year-old American citizen, was wounded by gunfire. Two assailants on a motorcycle shot her in the right cheek and left arm as she was driving from the Jinnah Medical and Dental College, where she works as vice principal. Police found anti-American pamphlets in her car. Lobo is unconscious but expected to survive and is being treated at Aga Khan Hospital. She has lived in Pakistan since 1996 and is married to a Pakistani. Karachi police are investigating, and the U.S. Consulate is in contact with them."
15786,"Based on the passage, a family from Delaware became seriously ill while staying at a rented villa in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands. The two teenage sons are in a coma, and their father is conscious but unable to move or talk. The mother was treated and released. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suspects the cause was exposure to a pesticide, as preliminary tests found methyl bromide, a toxic pesticide not permitted for indoor use, in the family's unit. The EPA is investigating a fumigation that occurred at the resort. The unit below the family's was treated by the company Terminix. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation into the matter."
15789,"The American Pharmacists Association has adopted an official policy discouraging its members from participating in executions, stating that it is ""fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers."" This action was prompted by increased public attention on lethal injection, including a botched execution in Oklahoma and a postponed one in Georgia due to cloudy medication. The passage notes that states are facing shortages of the preferred drug, pentobarbital, because its manufacturer and others have stopped providing it for capital punishment. This has led states to use compounded preparations and, in Utah, to reinstate the firing squad as an alternative method. The association's new policy aligns with similar positions held by other medical organizations."
15791,"A new way to discuss climate change is emerging that frames it as a personal public health issue rather than an impersonal one focused on emissions. This approach was the subject of a roundtable discussion at Howard University's College of Medicine featuring President Barack Obama, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, and EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.

Dr. Murthy noted that climate change could worsen conditions like asthma, while President Obama cited the past success of the Clean Air Act in improving Los Angeles's air as proof that positive change is possible. According to senior adviser Brian Deese, a study found that seven out of ten doctors report climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 from malaria, diarrhea, heat exposure, and under-nutrition, with children, the elderly, and developing countries being the most vulnerable.

The passage mentions potential solutions, including using data from companies like Google and Microsoft to create apps for monitoring air quality and encouraging the public to pressure elected officials. A TIME magazine article suggests that medical professionals may be the best messengers for this issue, as framing it around public health is more emotionally compelling and hopeful."
15800,"After cycling for 460 days across China, cyclist Wang Pingan had his mountain bike stolen in the city of Shenzhen, just days before completing his journey. The theft, which took 10 minutes, was captured on surveillance cameras. Despite initial doubts about its recovery, Shenzhen police apprehended a suspect and returned the bike to Wang, who had refused offers for a new one, calling the original his ""best friend."" The bike had reportedly been sold twice before being recovered. Reunited with his bike, Wang was able to continue the final few days of his 29,200-kilometer trip to his last destination, Hainan Island."
15817,"Migrants from over 20 countries, including Eritrea, Somalia, Syria, and nations in West Africa, are drawn to Libya as the primary embarkation point for Europe. According to the passage, their motivations are varied, ranging from fleeing repression, military service, and war to seeking economic opportunities. In 2014, over 80% of migrants trying to reach Europe traveled to the Libyan coast, taking advantage of the country's chaos and unguarded borders.

The journey is perilous, involving established smuggling routes across deserts where migrants risk robbery, kidnapping, and abandonment. Smugglers, who operate in relays and through hubs like Agadez in Niger, charge fees that can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. The passage states that Syrians, who are often better off, may pay for safer passage on the top deck of a vessel, while Africans are more frequently confined to the hold. Smugglers rarely accompany the migrants on the sea voyage, instead providing a compass or GPS for boats that are often unseaworthy. The passage also notes that some migrants are individuals who had previously lived and worked in Libya but are now fleeing violence and persecution within the country."
11317,"Based on the passage, Walmart's opposition to a ""religious freedom"" law in its home state of Arkansas is presented as significant evidence of growing support for gay rights. This action, along with a recent decision to raise worker pay, has positioned the company as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on political issues. The business community at large, including companies like Apple, the NCAA, and Angie's List, also strongly opposed similar legislation in Indiana, with some threatening to pull business from the state.

This corporate backlash has created a challenge for the Republican Party. Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty suggested the GOP should take note of Walmart's actions and move to support policies like prohibiting discrimination against gay and lesbian individuals. The issue has divided potential Republican presidential candidates, with Jeb Bush moderating his initial support for the laws while Ted Cruz criticized the business community's opposition. The passage notes that Walmart's stance reflects its diverse customer base and the country's increasingly progressive views, with business leaders stating that equality is good for business and that they will speak out on issues that impact their employees."
11323,"Based on the passage, Easter is a Christian event celebrating Christ's Crucifixion and Resurrection. Its date is not fixed, but is determined by astronomical events: it falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. This timing is related to the Jewish holiday of Passover.

Western and Eastern Orthodox Christians typically celebrate on different dates because they use different calendars (Gregorian and Julian, respectively). The passage describes Easter celebrations at the Vatican led by Pope Francis and at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem.

Secular traditions like the Easter bunny and colorful eggs were likely brought to North America by German immigrants in the 1700s, with the first known written mention in 1682. One theory for the origin of Easter eggs is that people abstained from eating them during Lent, leading to a surplus that was then decorated and given as gifts. The passage concludes with a tip on using Kool-Aid to color Easter eggs."
11332,"In response to a question from lawmaker and former wrestler Antonio Inoki, Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated to the Diet that the country's Air Self Defense Force (ASDF) has never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object. Nakatani explained that when the ASDF scrambles jets for unidentified objects, they have found birds or other flying objects, but never anything believed to have come from a place other than Earth. Inoki had asked if aircraft were scrambled for extraterrestrial threats and if research was being done on alien visitors. The passage also notes that in 2007, a different defense minister had previously considered the legal issues of defending against an alien invasion under Japan's constitution."
11349,"Based on the passage, Lauren Hill was a 19-year-old from Indiana who died from brain cancer. She became an inspirational figure after realizing her dream to play college basketball for Mount St. Joseph University. The university successfully petitioned the NCAA to move up its opening game so she could play, and she scored the first and last points. Hill also helped raise $1.4 million for pediatric cancer research with the nonprofit group The Cure Starts Now. Diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in high school, she was remembered for her positive message, her slogan ""Never Give Up,"" and for encouraging others to ""cherish every moment."""
11353,"A 20 to 30-foot section of a fiberglass boat, suspected to be from the 2011 Japan tsunami, was found off the Oregon coast and towed to a harbor in Newport. Inside the fragment were yellowtail jack fish, a species normally found in Japanese waters. Biologists determined the ecological threat from invasive species was small. The boat remnant will be taken to a landfill, and the fish will be moved to the Oregon Coast Aquarium."
11355,"Based on the passage, former Australian cricket captain and legendary broadcaster Richie Benaud has died at the age of 84. Last year, he had stated he was being treated for skin cancer.

As a player, Benaud captained Australia from 1958/59 to 1963/1964, never losing a series. He was the first cricketer to achieve a Test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. After his playing career, he became a renowned broadcaster for over four decades, working with the BBC and known for his witty commentary.

His death prompted condolences from figures such as the Australian and British Prime Ministers and cricketers like Shane Warne and Imran Khan. The Australian Prime Minister requested that flags be flown at half-mast on the day of Benaud's funeral."
11356,"NASA astrophysicist Amy Mainzer has named an asteroid after Malala Yousafzai, a teenage education activist from Pakistan and Nobel Peace Prize winner. Mainzer discovered Asteroid 316201 in June 2010, which gave her the right to name it. She was motivated to do so after her colleague, Dr. Carrie Nugent, noted that few asteroids are named to honor the contributions of women, particularly women of color. The asteroid, officially named 316201 Malala, is about 4 kilometers in diameter with a dark surface and orbits the sun between Mars and Jupiter every five and a half years. Mainzer believes that educating girls increases humanity's potential to solve difficult problems."
11366,"An explosion occurred late Thursday around 8:30 p.m. outside the Bauchi Motor Park in Gombe, Nigeria, killing at least five people and injuring more than a dozen. According to witnesses, a woman left a handbag with explosives near a bus destined for Jos. She pretended to be a passenger, dropped the bag, walked away, and it exploded moments later, setting the bus on fire. While no group has claimed responsibility, Boko Haram is considered the main suspect due to a history of similar attacks on soft targets. The passage notes this was the first attack since Nigeria's presidential election."
11370,"At a Summit of the Americas in Panama, a historic handshake occurred between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. The passage argues that this summit is a crucial opportunity for the U.S. to reverse its declining influence in Latin America, where China, Russia, and Iran have made inroads. Previous summits have been diplomatic and public relations disasters for the U.S., including a Secret Service scandal in Cartagena and an incident where Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez publicly gave Obama a book critical of the U.S.

While Obama's new Cuba policy is a significant development, the passage notes a miscalculation regarding sanctions on Venezuela, which has allowed President Nicolas Maduro to portray himself as a victim. To rebuild ties, the U.S. must align itself with the desires of Latin American people for democracy, prosperity, and the rule of law. The passage suggests that if Obama can demonstrate that the U.S. is a true partner in these efforts, he can create a more lasting legacy than just a handshake. His meeting with Cuban dissidents is noted as a positive step toward this goal."
11384,"Based on the passage, the author recounts being groped on a crowded train in Mumbai at age 13, an experience she did not speak about for 25 years. This personal story introduces the pervasive issue of sexual harassment against women and girls in India, which occurs in public spaces and includes acts like groping, public masturbation, stalking, non-consensual photography, staring, and catcalling. A study found that 80% of women in Mumbai have faced street harassment. This behavior is often normalized, and many women alter their daily lives to avoid it, such as changing their clothes or travel routes.

The author notes that while harassment is widespread, it is rarely reported to official channels due to cultural challenges like shame, fear of bringing ""disrepute"" to their families, and distrust of police. The author encourages women to speak up and know their legal rights. Two recent cases are provided as examples where women reporting harassment against powerful men made a difference: an employee's allegations led to Rajendra Pachauri stepping down from a UN position, and another employee's report led to the arrest of media founder Tarun Tejpal. The author concludes that women, with the help of allies, must find the courage to speak out against harassment to live fuller lives and change the culture for the next generation."
11395,"Following a deadly 2014 season where an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall killed 16 Nepalis, mountaineers have returned to Mount Everest. In response to the incident, the climbing route through the notoriously dangerous icefall has been changed to a longer but safer central path that was used in the 1990s. This new route requires crossing more crevasses with more ladders.

Nepal issued 347 climbing permits for the new season, a slight increase from the previous year. However, due to safety concerns, at least one company has moved its expeditions from the Nepal side to the northern route in China, which does not have an icefall. The number of climbers on the Chinese side has significantly increased, causing concern for Nepal's tourism-dependent economy and the Sherpas who rely on expeditions for their livelihood. Many Sherpas are returning to work despite the stress on their families, who remember last year's tragedy."
11400,"The passage discusses a growing trend of individuals ordering their own lab tests, a movement promoted by public figures and enabled by legislation in over half the states. The author argues that this ""freedom to test"" will lead to more medical care rather than better health. Testing healthy people often reveals ""abnormal"" results that are common in normal individuals, leading to increased anxiety, unnecessary follow-up procedures, and over-treatment for conditions that may not have been harmful. The author notes that while individual test prices might decrease, the overall volume of testing and subsequent care will increase costs. The passage concludes that while this freedom should not be outlawed, it requires regulation, similar to how the FDA handles treatments, and public education on the potential harms and limitations of testing healthy individuals."
11410,"Based on the passage, Canadian CF-18 Hornet fighter jets have conducted their first airstrike against ISIS in Syria, successfully bombing one of the group's garrisons near Raqqa. This action follows a recently expanded mandate, as Canadian forces had already been conducting strikes against ISIS in Iraq since November. The Department of National Defence reported the strike as successful and stated that the aircraft and crews returned safely to base. According to Defense Minister Jason Kenney, the strike demonstrates Canada's resolve to combat terrorism. The number of casualties from the airstrike was not immediately clear."
11768,"On April 8 in Houston, Danielle Busby gave birth to the first set of all-female quintuplets in the world since 1969. The five girls were delivered via C-section at 28 weeks and two days. Danielle and her husband Adam, who conceived through intrauterine insemination, are blogging about their experience. While initially reported as the first all-female quintuplets born in the U.S., another set was born in 1959 but died within 24 hours.

The passage also describes Sharon and Korey Rademacher, who had twin girls in Pensacola, Florida, on March 11. They kept the fact that they were having twins a secret from their family and recorded their reactions in a YouTube video that has been viewed more than 700,000 times."
11779,"Based on the passage, the United States government has revised its policy for Americans on the no-fly list in response to a federal court ruling that found the previous process unconstitutional. Under the new policy, Americans on the list will be informed of their status and given a reason for their inclusion. They can then dispute their status in writing and receive a final decision from the Transportation Security Administration.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which brought the lawsuit that led to the change, is not satisfied with the revised policy. The ACLU argues it falls short of constitutional requirements because it does not provide for a meaningful hearing before a judge, which the original court ruling had called for, and is challenging the new process in court. Before this change, individuals were not officially confirmed or denied their inclusion on the list."
11791,"Dr. Kristen Lindsey, a Texas veterinarian, shot an orange tabby cat with an arrow and posted a photo of it on Facebook with a caption celebrating her ""first bow kill."" The post triggered public outrage, leading to calls that overwhelmed her employer, the Washington County's Animal Clinic, and crashed its website. An animal rescuer claimed the cat was a pet named ""Tiger,"" though this was not confirmed by CNN. Despite initially boasting that she would not be fired, the clinic terminated her employment. The sheriff's office in Austin County is investigating the incident, and Lindsey could face charges. While animal rights activists are pushing for her prosecution and offering a reward, one customer defended her as a ""good vet"" who made a bad choice in posting the photo."
11795,"In a video captured by WMAR, a woman in Baltimore is seen pulling her masked son from a crowd during riots, repeatedly smacking him in the head, and screaming at him. According to the report, the woman saw her son on television throwing rocks at police. The woman's name was not immediately known. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts publicly thanked the mother, stating he wished more parents would take charge of their children."
11808,"Based on the passage, the journey from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, to the village of Ravi Opi in the Kavre District is slow due to roads damaged by a major earthquake. In Ravi Opi, a village official states that 90% of the houses are uninhabitable, and residents are too scared of aftershocks to return to the ones still standing.

The passage recounts the stories of survivors, including Maili Tamang, a 62-year-old woman who escaped her collapsing house with an injured leg, and Mahesh Koiraba, who lost his 2-year-old daughter. Displaced families are living in makeshift shelters, and a resident named Osminda Koirale reports that they have received no government support and lack food, clothing, and proper shelter. Despite the devastation and ongoing fear from aftershocks, people are working in their fields out of necessity. The author notes that if conditions are this dire just outside the capital, the situation is likely far worse in more remote, harder-hit areas where aid has not yet arrived."
11817,"On ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,"" Jeremy Renner, in character as Hawkeye, played the piano and sang a parody of Ed Sheeran's ""Thinking Out Loud."" The song described his other ""powers"" besides archery, which include his collection of scarves and berets, his ability to play the trombone, and being able to open a pickle jar. The passage also notes that Renner has starred in ""Avengers"" films, ""The Hurt Locker,"" ""American Hustle,"" and films in the ""Bourne"" and ""Mission Impossible"" franchises."
11821,"Director Bryan Singer announced via Instagram that Olivia Munn will play the telepathic character Psylocke, also known as Betsy Braddock, in the film ""X-Men: Apocalypse."" The movie, a follow-up to ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" was in production for a May 27, 2016 release and also stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, and Jennifer Lawrence. The comic book character Psylocke was created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe for the ""Captain Britain"" series and joined the X-Men in 1987."
11826,"Cosmologist Stephen Hawking partnered with Monty Python to recreate the ""Galaxy Song"" from their 1983 film ""The Meaning of Life."" The collaboration was for Record Store Day, with a 7-inch single available for sale. The song's accompanying video shows scientist Brian Cox criticizing the song's inaccuracies, after which Hawking knocks him over in his wheelchair and sings the song in his computerized voice before launching into space. This scene is derived from a bit in Monty Python's live shows. The original song was written by Eric Idle and John Du Prez. Hawking's version is available for download, and he was also previously featured on the Pink Floyd song ""Talkin' Hawkin'."""
11838,"The author recounts witnessing the 1980 Miami riots as a 12-year-old, which began after police officers were acquitted in the death of Arthur McDuffie. This event is presented as part of a historical pattern of riots, including those in the 1960s, Los Angeles in 1992, and Baltimore in 2015, which were often catalyzed by perceived unjust police actions against African Americans.

Initially viewing riots as senseless violence, the author's perspective changed after moderating a panel titled ""Riot -- The Voice of the Unheard?"". From this experience, the author learned that riots can be seen as purposeful uprisings by those who feel hopeless and that they have historically prompted government action. Commissions formed after past riots, such as the Kerner and Christopher Commissions, identified underlying causes like racism, poverty, and police brutality. The passage cites Martin Luther King Jr., who called a riot ""the language of the unheard,"" condemning both the violence and the intolerable conditions that lead to it. The author contrasts this with the nonviolent protests in Ferguson, which also resulted in a government response and recommendations for police reform."
11839,"On Sunday night, the Israeli military conducted airstrikes in the occupied Golan Heights, targeting four militants who had crossed from Syria. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the militants were allegedly trying to plant a bomb on the border. The military stated that the airstrikes prevented the bombing. Israeli media reported that three of the alleged attackers were killed. The militant group to which the men belonged was not immediately known. The Golan Heights, seized by Israel from Syria in 1967, is considered occupied territory internationally."
11840,"A Singapore logic problem known as ""Cheryl's birthday"" went viral after television host Kenneth Kong posted it on Facebook. The problem was originally intended for high-school students in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad. The puzzle provides a list of 10 possible dates for Cheryl's birthday: May 15, May 16, May 19, June 17, June 18, July 14, July 16, August 14, August 15, or August 17. The solution can be found by analyzing a conversation between two friends, Albert and Bernard, to eliminate nine of the dates. The passage notes that the problem has been compared to the ""What color is the dress"" debate and that solutions have been posted by a Georgia Tech Mathematician, The New York Times, and the Washington Post."
11858,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a severe HIV outbreak has been ongoing in rural Indiana since mid-December, with 142 people testing positive in Scott and Jackson counties. The outbreak has spread among users of a prescription opioid called Opana, and the high number of cases is significant for the area's small population.

Several factors have contributed to the spread. The area has sparse health resources, with Scott County having only one non-specialist infectious disease doctor. Younger users are reportedly less aware of the dangers of sharing needles. The drug Opana requires frequent daily injections with a larger-gauge needle, increasing the risk of infection through shared use, which is described as a ""community activity"" among some families.

In response, Indiana declared a public health emergency, and health volunteers from Indiana University are running a weekly clinic and educating residents. The governor also authorized a temporary needle exchange program. Health leaders view the situation as a warning about the growing threat of diseases like HIV and Hepatitis C spreading through IV drug use nationwide."
11860,"Leslie Morris, a friend of Joni Mitchell for over 44 years, has filed a legal petition to be named the singer-songwriter's conservator. Mitchell was hospitalized a month ago after being found unconscious and remains at UCLA Medical Center. There are conflicting reports about her condition: Morris's April 28 court petition states Mitchell is unconscious and unable to respond, while a statement on Mitchell's website from the same day, reportedly approved by Morris, says she is alert, not in a coma, and a full recovery is expected. Mitchell's publicist, Alisse Kingsley, stated that the website's information is accurate. According to a doctor's declaration, Mitchell will likely be unable to attend court hearings for the next four to six months due to her medical condition."
11870,"A forthcoming book titled ""Clinton Cash"" is set to detail alleged conflicts of interest involving foreign and corporate donations to the Clinton family's charities. The passage notes that the Clinton Foundation received money from foreign governments, including Canada's foreign affairs department, which was promoting the Keystone XL pipeline that the State Department later analyzed favorably. Additionally, the Clinton Global Initiative accepted donations from banks that had business before the U.S. government.

The passage also raises a separate critique regarding the charities' poor management, citing financial deficits and an instance of being deceived by a con man. However, it states there is no ""smoking gun"" proving a direct exchange of money for favors, nor any indication the Clintons knew about investigations into the donating banks. The author suggests that unless the book reveals significant new information, these issues, which Hillary Clinton calls ""distractions,"" are unlikely to harm her campaign, as polls indicate voters are more concerned with economic problems."
11875,"Andrew Lesnie, the 59-year-old Oscar-winning cinematographer, died of a heart attack. He was known for his collaboration with director Peter Jackson on the six ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"" films, as well as ""King Kong"" and ""The Lovely Bones."" Lesnie won an Oscar for ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Jackson hired him for the trilogy after being impressed with his work on the ""Babe"" films. Lesnie's other work includes ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes,"" ""I Am Legend,"" and his final film, ""The Water Diviner,"" directed by Russell Crowe. His death was confirmed by a spokesman from the Australian Cinematographers Society."
11877,"According to the passage, the Waze smartphone application, owned by Google, poses a significant risk to law enforcement officers. Its ""traffic cop"" feature uses crowdsourcing to allow its 50 million users to pinpoint the location of police, making them potential targets for ambush attacks, which were the leading cause of felonious officer deaths in 2014. The passage cites the case of Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who used Waze to track police before assassinating two New York officers.

The author also argues that the app obstructs law enforcement by helping users, including drunk drivers and speeders, evade traffic laws. The passage states that other criminals, such as domestic violence perpetrators and gang members, can also use the feature. Despite Google's reputation for corporate responsibility and its stated mission, its executives have refused to discuss these concerns with law enforcement organizations like the National Sheriffs' Association. The author concludes that the risks of the app outweigh its benefits and urges Google to work with law enforcement to ensure safety."
11888,"Photographer Simon Brann Thorpe created the project ""Toy Soldiers"" to combat desensitization to war imagery. He photographed real soldiers from the Polisario Front, an independence movement in conflict with Morocco over Western Sahara, posing them to look like green plastic toy soldiers. The project was shot in the Western Sahara desert at historic battle locations. Thorpe, a landscape photographer, intended for the images to create a ""visual metaphor"" that provokes a response when viewers realize the subjects are real soldiers, not toys. The five-week project required clearance from the Polisario Front military, and the soldiers participated by helping build the platforms they stood on out of old oil drums. Thorpe hopes the images will raise questions about how war imagery will be consumed in the future. The project is available as a book."
11900,"On Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina, a gunman shot and killed the school's print shop operator, Ron Lane. The suspected gunman, who remains at large, was identified as 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, a former student who once worked for the victim. Authorities described Stancil as ""armed and dangerous"" and stated the shooting was an ""isolated situation"" and ""not a random situation."" The school was placed on lockdown, and all buildings were cleared by law enforcement. The shooting occurred on the third floor of a campus building, not in the library."
11908,"New Belgium Brewery and Ben & Jerry's are collaborating on a new beer inspired by salted caramel brownie ice cream. According to statements from both companies, the project is intended to raise awareness for social issues they are passionate about. Both companies are certified ""B Corporations"" with a history of social activism. The beer is set to be released in the fall, with more details about the campaign to be announced later in the year. The passage also states there is no talk of a beer-flavored ice cream at this time."
11910,"In the NCAA men's basketball Final Four, the Wisconsin Badgers defeated the previously undefeated Kentucky Wildcats 71-64, ending Kentucky's perfect season at a 38-1 record. Frank Kaminsky led Wisconsin with 20 points and 11 rebounds, while Karl-Anthony Towns was Kentucky's top scorer with 16 points. In the other semifinal game, Duke dominated Michigan State 81-61. Justise Winslow scored 19 points for Duke, while Denzel Valentine led Michigan State with 22 points and 11 rebounds. As a result, Wisconsin will play Duke in the championship game."
11911,"Based on the passage, Saudi forces conducted new airstrikes in southern Yemen less than 24 hours after announcing the end of their ""Operation Decisive Storm"" campaign. The new strikes followed a Houthi rebel attack on a Yemeni government military brigade. In response, a Houthi spokesman called for U.N.-sponsored peace talks to resume, but only after a complete halt to the attacks.

The Saudis stated their new initiative, ""Operation Renewal of Hope,"" would focus on the political process, protecting civilians, and providing humanitarian aid, but that military action would be taken if needed. Meanwhile, the Houthis released Yemeni Defense Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi, who had been detained since March 26. Yemeni President Hadi, who is allied with the Saudis, thanked the coalition and promised to return to Yemen. The passage also notes that U.S. drone strikes targeted al Qaeda militants in Mukalla."
11922,"Based on the passage, Falih Essawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, reported from the front lines that the key Iraqi city of Ramadi was on the verge of being taken by ISIS. He stated that security was ""collapsing rapidly"" and pleaded for reinforcements from the Iraqi government and air support from the U.S.-led coalition.

According to Essawi, ISIS militants made significant advances on Wednesday, entering the city center from the east after having already seized areas to the north and south. The fighting on Wednesday resulted in at least 10 Iraqi security forces killed and over 100 wounded, and has caused at least 150,000 people to flee. A U.S. military spokesman confirmed that the coalition had conducted seven airstrikes near Ramadi since Monday and that the city remained ""contested."" Another U.S. official stated that the fall of Ramadi was ""not imminent."""
11932,"Based on the passage, the author proposes that on Equal Pay Day, April 14, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should announce that if elected, she will take a 23% pay cut. This percentage reflects the gender wage gap, where women earn an average of 77 cents for every dollar men earn.

The author describes this as a ""political stunt"" that would serve as a powerful symbolic act of solidarity with working women. It would also help Clinton, a wealthy individual, counter perceptions of being out of touch and reinforce her campaign's populist message of being a ""champion"" for ""everyday Americans.""

The passage notes that Equal Pay Day is the date into the new year (April 14, 2015) that women must work to earn what men made in the previous year (2014). The author argues that the offensive nature of a female president taking less pay is precisely the point, as it would effectively highlight the offensive reality of the nationwide wage gap."
11945,"Based on the passage, the brutal treatment of women by modern Jihadi groups like ISIS and Boko Haram is a deliberate strategy for building a ""caliphate."" Unlike killing male enemies to win battles, the systematic capture, sexual enslavement, and forced marriage of women is intended to establish the social structures of a new society. Women are considered indispensable for running homes, raising children, and creating a functioning community under the groups' interpretation of Sharia law.

This approach differs from that of the previous generation of jihadis, like al Qaeda, which viewed a caliphate as a distant goal. It also differs from other historical conflicts where women were abused and discarded; ISIS and Boko Haram incorporate enslaved women into the daily life of the territories they rule. ISIS justifies its actions, such as selling Yazidi women as slaves, by citing Islamic writings in its online magazine. The result is an oppressive, fear-filled existence for all women in these territories, with some escapees reporting that the conditions led them to attempt suicide."
11948,"Based on the passage, SpaceX is planning to launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a Dragon cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS). After a weather delay, the launch is scheduled for Tuesday at 4:10 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Following the launch, SpaceX will attempt the unprecedented feat of landing the rocket's first stage upright on a drone ship in the Atlantic. The purpose of this, according to founder Elon Musk, is to reduce space access costs by reusing rockets. A previous landing attempt in January failed, and the company estimates a 50% chance of success for this try.

The Dragon spacecraft will deliver over 4,300 pounds of supplies to the ISS. After about five weeks, it will be filled with over 3,000 pounds of experiments and trash for return to Earth, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. This is SpaceX's sixth mission to the ISS. If the rocket landing fails, SpaceX intends to keep trying."
11979,"In the Boston Marathon bombing trial, jurors deliberated for over seven hours without reaching a verdict for the accused, 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He faces 30 counts, 17 of which carry a potential sentence of life in prison or the death penalty.

The prosecution argued that Tsarnaev was a willing terrorist who, with his brother Tamerlan, wanted to ""punish America"" and ""terrorize this country."" They presented graphic testimony and videos from the bombing on April 15, 2013, which killed three people and severely injured others. They also detailed the subsequent killing of an MIT police officer.

Tsarnaev's defense attorney, Judy Clarke, conceded his participation but argued that his older brother, Tamerlan, was the instigator of the plot. The defense maintained that Dzhokhar, who was 19 at the time, was simply following his more radicalized brother. The defense's strategy focused on sparing Tsarnaev's life rather than proving his innocence. If the jury finds Tsarnaev guilty of at least one capital count, the trial will proceed to a penalty phase."
12008,"Based on the passage, the author explores the idea of a ""marriage apocalypse"" by examining why millennials are not prioritizing marriage. Interviews with Kent State journalism students reveal they value careers, travel, and financial independence over getting married, citing student debt and the high cost of weddings as barriers. They would rather be happy and single than in an unhappy relationship.

The passage provides context with statistics showing a rise in divorce rates since 1960 and a Pew Research report indicating that a majority of young adults believe society is fine if people have priorities other than marriage. While economists are concerned because marriage is correlated with economic well-being, the causality is unclear. The text points to Scandinavia as a region with a high quality of life where cohabitation is common and marriage is not a priority. Swedes cited in the passage state that marriage costs money, offers no significant advantages, and lacks social pressure, asserting that it should be for love, not expectation—a view the Kent State students share."
12060,"Iraqi forces, aided by Shiite militiamen, have taken control of the northern city of Tikrit from ISIS. Despite the victory, fear remains due to explosives and booby-trapped buildings left behind by ISIS, which Iraqi forces are working to disarm. Officials are also concerned about potential ""scorched earth"" reprisals by the Iranian-backed Shiite militiamen against Tikrit's Sunni population, which could stoke sectarian anger.

The liberation is a significant victory for the Iraqi government, which had previously failed to retake the city. The push was supported by U.S.-led airstrikes, and the Prime Minister credited surprise and the help of the militiamen for the success. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for a future offensive to retake Mosul."
12068,"Based on the passage provided, the Red Cross has called for an immediate 24-hour ceasefire in Yemen to provide aid to those wounded in recent airstrikes and ground fighting, warning that many will die without it. The conflict pits Shiite Houthi rebels against fighters loyal to Yemen's displaced president, who is supported by a nine-country Arab coalition, led by Saudi Arabia, conducting airstrikes.

A U.N. Security Council meeting to discuss the situation adjourned with no decision. Russia submitted a draft resolution to halt the airstrikes, but a diplomat criticized it for not also calling on the Houthis to stop fighting. The conflict escalated after the Houthis forced President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power, prompting the Saudi-led intervention. The United Nations reports that in the past two weeks, at least 519 people have been killed and 1,700 wounded.

13816,"Based on the passage provided, Xanax, also known as alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine that works by enhancing the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA to produce a calming effect. It is effective for providing rapid, short-term relief for acute anxiety episodes. However, the passage notes concerns about its use, including the potential for developing tolerance, which can lead to increased dosages, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. For chronic anxiety, other treatments like therapy or lifestyle modifications are suggested as potentially more sustainable. The text concludes that Xanax should be used with caution under the guidance of a healthcare professional as part of a holistic approach to anxiety management."
13823,"Based on the passage, U.S. Army troops from Fort Cavazos and Fort Bliss in Texas are deploying to the Middle East as part of a 900-troop deployment. Their mission is to protect U.S. troops from drone and rocket attacks following at least 16 recent attacks in Iraq and Syria that caused minor injuries to 21 U.S. forces.

Most soldiers from Fort Bliss will operate a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) System, while the rest from Fort Bliss and the soldiers from Fort Cavazos will serve as ""air defense headquarters elements.""

13827,"In ""Big Brother 25,"" the new Head of Household, Bowie Jane, is being pressured by the house to backdoor Cameron Hardin, who is seen as a ""competition beast."" Jag Bains, though aligned with Cameron in ""The Fugitives,"" also believes Cameron needs to be evicted. Bowie, however, is not convinced and has nominated Felica Cannon and Cirie Fields, viewing both as threats to her game.

Cameron wants Bowie to target Cory Wurtrnberger, but she is hesitant. Cory has also approached Bowie about backdooring Cameron, but she stated she is not interested in doing so this week. The Power of Veto players are Bowie, Felica, Cirie, Jag, Matt, and America. If America, Cirie, or Felica wins the POV, Bowie must name a replacement nominee and could target Cory. If Bowie, Jag, or Matt wins, the nominations will likely stay the same."
13829,"In Week 10 of *Big Brother 25*, Cameron Hardin was evicted because he kept winning challenges and had difficulty connecting with other houseguests. Following his eviction, Jag Bains became the ""Secret HOH"" and secretly nominated Blue Kim and Felicia. This led some houseguests to regret evicting Cameron. Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields stated they missed Cameron because he was upfront. Blue also expressed regret, as Cameron had warned her before his eviction that Jag and Matt Klotz would target her next, which she didn't believe until she was nominated. The passage also notes that a Double Veto will take place in Week 11."
13834,"For Week 10 of Big Brother 25, Bowie Jane became the Head of Household for the first time and nominated Felicia Cannon and Cirie Fields for eviction.

13840,"Based on the passage, New York Republicans, led by Representative Anthony D'Esposito, have made a motion to expel Representative George Santos from Congress. This follows 23 new federal criminal counts against Santos, including identity theft and charging campaign contributors' credit cards without their consent. The sponsors of the motion, who also cite Santos's previously fabricated resume, believe he is ""not fit to serve.""

A vote on the expulsion is scheduled for the upcoming week, but Santos has stated he will not resign. His removal may be difficult due to the narrow Republican majority of 221 to 212. Republican leadership might table the measure or refer it to a committee. Furthermore, expelling Santos requires 290 votes, meaning 78 Republicans would need to vote for removal alongside all Democrats. The passage suggests the controversy will continue even if he survives the vote."
13842,"Based on the passage, Survivor has implemented a new sit-out rule. Previously, castaways could not sit out consecutive challenges within a single cycle, but the count would reset at Tribal Council. This allowed a person to sit out consecutive Immunity Challenges if there were no Reward Challenges. The new rule, as explained by host Jeff Probst, is that a player cannot sit out back-to-back challenges at all.

This change was made because the game was shortened from 39 to 26 days and was prompted by contestant Claire Rafson from Survivor 44 sitting out three consecutive Immunity Challenges, which led to pushback. The passage also notes that new Survivor episodes are 90 minutes long, a format seen as a consequence of the Hollywood strikes, and mentions recently eliminated Survivor 45 castaways Hannah Rose and Brandon Donlon."
13843,"Based on the passage, spoilers for ""The Young and the Restless"" for the week of October 23 indicate that Nick Newman will force Sally Spectra to choose between him and his brother, Adam Newman.

She initially refuses to choose and considers leaving both men.

During the week, Sally and Adam will sleep together, which solidifies her connection to Adam but does not change her feelings for Nick. The brothers get into a physical altercation over Sally, which she breaks up. Nick then demands that she make a decision. The spoilers state that Sally's choice will be a shock to viewers."
13846,"Based on the passage provided, scientists at Rice University have received $45 million to develop a three-inch, chargeable implant called HAMMR for cancer treatment. This system aims to continuously monitor a patient's cancer and adjust immunotherapy drug doses in real-time through a closed-loop system that communicates wirelessly. Researchers believe the implant is for short-term use and could potentially eradicate cancer in as little as 60 days. The technology is designed to overcome the limitations of current diagnostic tools by providing real-time data from the tumor environment. The first clinical trial will focus on recurrent ovarian cancer, with human trials expected to start within five years, and it holds promise for a broad range of peritoneal cancers."
13848,"Based on the passage, the Miami Dolphins are a potential trade target for Commanders' defensive end Chase Young. The Dolphins' defensive line has struggled to generate consistent pressure and sacks this season, with player Emmanuel Ogbah being described as ""ineffective"" with 2.5 sacks. Young, who has 5 sacks, is presented as a ""massive upgrade.""

A report from CBS Sports’ Josina Anderson states that several teams are prepared to trade for Young. While a trade would require an immediate long-term contract extension, the passage suggests the Dolphins could manage this, citing their willingness to sign Jonathan Taylor to a lucrative contract. Adding Young to the defensive line is seen as a way to boost its potency for a playoff push."

The Biden administration has made Venezuelan nationals who entered the US by July 31 eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which may speed up the work permit process for asylum seekers in New York City.

To accelerate the process, a USCIS representative stated the agency is providing education sessions, sending email and SMS alerts to migrants about their eligibility, and offering mobile biometric services. Jaddou of USCIS asserts the agency is committed to an average 30-day processing time for work permits. However, Jaddou also claimed that more funding from Congress is needed to process more applications, as the agency's current funding can be restrictive."
13874,"Based on the passage, a Pentagon report indicates that China has launched its first nuclear-powered guided missile submarines, which will allow its navy to conduct long-range precision strikes against land targets.

This deployment, announced on October 24, comes amidst a surge in foiled drone attacks and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has also prompted the U.S. to send additional personnel to the region.

Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, commander of Air Forces Central Command (AFCENT), stated that the arrival of these Airmen will bolster the capacity to assist partners and strengthen regional stability. AFCENT's current fleet in the region includes three squadrons of F-16s, two of A-10s, one of F-15Es, and various other strategic aircraft."
13894,"On October 30, District Judge Alia Moses granted a temporary restraining order, requested by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, that halts U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents from cutting concertina wire at the southern border. The order, which is temporary until November 13, makes an exception for medical emergencies that could result in serious injury or death. Texas claims agents were cutting the wire to allow migrants to cross, while the Biden administration states it was done to provide medical aid and fulfill federal responsibilities. The two parties will present their arguments on November 7."
13895,"Based on the passage, Illinois Senate President Don Harmon is supporting legislation to provide property tax breaks to nursing homes in Cook County while having received nearly $2 million in campaign contributions from the nursing home industry's trade group. The legislation would reclassify for-profit nursing homes from commercial to residential property, lowering their taxes.

A spokesman for Harmon stated that legislative decisions are made in the public's best interest, and an industry representative denied a direct link between the contributions and Harmon's support. The legislation passed the General Assembly, but Governor J.B. Pritzker used an amendatory veto to remove the nursing home provision, arguing it would shift the tax burden to homeowners and small businesses. The nursing home industry is now seeking an override of the veto, which is reportedly supported by Harmon's chief of staff."

The lights were seen in states including Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota, and as far south as southern Wisconsin and Omaha, Nebraska.

This event was unexpected because the CME was weak, had slower solar wind speeds, and did not create the data spike that aurora hunters typically watch for.

15748,"Jill (Duggar) Dillard, the first daughter from the show ""19 Kids and Counting"" to be married, gave birth to a son named Israel David. The baby was born on a Monday, weighed 9 pounds, 10 ounces, and was more than a week past his due date. The father is Derick Dillard. Jill, a student midwife, told People magazine she was prepared for the late arrival. Her parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, posted a video of the new family on Facebook. The eldest Duggar son, Josh, has three children, and his wife, Anna, is expecting a fourth."
15777,"According to the passage, the author, a pilot, questions how the severe psychiatric issues of Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz were missed. While noting that depression is now treatable for pilots and no longer a career-ending diagnosis under FAA rules, the author believes Lubitz's illness was far more serious. The passage identifies several stages where red flags were potentially overlooked: during his time as a glider pilot, in the competitive Lufthansa selection process, and throughout the intense, supervised flight training program, from which Lubitz took an unusual leave of absence. Lubitz also reportedly disclosed a previous depression diagnosis to Lufthansa. The author finds it difficult to believe that none of Lubitz's colleagues noticed any issues in the confined cockpit environment. The passage also mentions potential contributing stressors, such as lower pay and more demanding schedules at Germanwings compared to Lufthansa, concluding that the tragedy was an ""accident waiting to happen."""
15782,"Based on the passage, Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, a 23-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, pleaded not guilty in Ohio to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and lying to the FBI. The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that in April 2014, Mohamud traveled to Syria for training in weapons, explosives, and combat. According to prosecutors, a cleric instructed him to return to the U.S. to commit a terrorist act. The indictment states his plan was to attack a military facility in Texas to kill three or four soldiers ""execution style,"" with a backup plan to attack a prison. The indictment also alleges Mohamud was happy his brother died fighting for al-Nusra Front in Syria. Mohamud has been remanded into custody."
15784,"According to the passage, two deputies involved in the fatal arrest of Eric Harris in Tulsa have been reassigned due to threats. During the arrest, Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot Harris. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter, claims the shooting was accidental, and says he intended to use a Taser. The two other deputies, who are not charged, were criticized for pinning Harris down as he said he was losing his breath.

Sheriff Stanley Glanz apologized to the Harris family but stated the FBI cleared the agency of civil rights violations. Glanz denied allegations that Bates' training records were forged, though he confirmed their friendship. The sheriff's office has suspended its drug unit's operations pending a review of the shooting, and a review of the two deputies' actions will be delayed until Bates' court case is settled. Harris's family believes the shooting reveals a ""deep-seated problem"" within the department."
11350,"Carlos Colina, 32, is facing murder charges in connection with the death of Jonathan Camilien, 26, whom he knew. Camilien's remains were first discovered in a duffel bag in Cambridge on a Saturday. A surveillance video then led police to an apartment building where more body parts were found. Before the murder charge, Colina had been arraigned for assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and improper disposal of a body. A judge also revoked his bail for a separate, unrelated assault and battery case involving a different victim."
11354,"On a rainy Tuesday on L Street NW in Washington, CNN correspondent Brian Todd and photojournalist Khalil Abdallah witnessed a mother duck and her ducklings causing a stir. Restaurant patrons and other pedestrians helped corral the ducks. A man used his umbrella, which the mother duck followed, while others stopped traffic to allow the family to cross the street safely. One duckling that tried to run back into the street was caught in time. The pedestrians then moved the ducks to a grassy area at 16th and L streets NW. Todd described the event as an ""extraordinary situation,"" noting that while other wildlife is common in D.C., seeing ducks in the middle of town was something he had never seen before."
11365,"According to a Saudi Defense Ministry official, over 500 Houthi rebels have been killed since Saudi-led military operations began on March 26. A nine-nation coalition has conducted 1,200 airstrikes with the stated aim of stopping the rebels from advancing toward southern Yemen. In a clash near the Saudi-Yemeni border, three Saudi military officers were killed and two were wounded by Houthi mortar fire. Casualty reports from Yemen vary: the Yemeni Health Ministry stated 385 civilians have been killed and 342 wounded, while the World Health Organization reported higher figures of 648 killed and 2,191 wounded, which include militant casualties. The conflict follows the Houthi rebels forcing Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. The United Nations reported that even before the airstrikes, most of Yemen's 25 million people required humanitarian assistance."
11396,"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Bishop Robert Finn of the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri. In 2012, Finn became the highest-ranking U.S. Catholic official convicted in the sex abuse scandal when he was found guilty of failing to report suspected child abuse. The case involved priest Shawn Ratigan, whose possession of disturbing images was known to church officials for nearly five months before they notified police. Finn was sentenced to two years' probation but remained in his position as bishop for years after the conviction, a delay that drew criticism.

Following the resignation, Kansas Archbishop Joseph Naumann was appointed as the diocese's temporary apostolic administrator. While some commentators, like professor Candida Moss, viewed the timing as a way for Pope Francis to ""reinstall confidence,"" watchdog groups like BishopAccountability.org called the move ""a good step but just the beginning,"" urging the Pope to publicly state the reason for the removal to ensure future bishop accountability."
11416,"Based on the passage, Tristan da Cunha, the world's most isolated human settlement with just under 270 residents, is holding an international design competition in partnership with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). The competition's goal is to improve the UK overseas territory's aging infrastructure, make it self-sustainable, and increase the energy efficiency of its buildings as it approaches its 200th anniversary.

The island seeks architects with experience in renewable energy, modern housing, and cost-effective agrarian systems to help reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and imports. Contestants must consider logistical challenges, such as the island's limited accessibility (by sea only 60 days a year) and constraints on shipping materials. While the island's main industry is lobster fishing and it is already largely self-sufficient in food, its cost of living has increased. The project, which aims to modernize government structures and improve energy efficiency, will require grant funding from the UK and possibly the EU."
11428,"Based on the passage, a ""Inside Politics"" discussion covered several key political stories.

President Obama is considering a historic face-to-face meeting with Cuban leader Raul Castro at a summit in Panama. According to Julie Pace of The Associated Press, the White House is weighing whether such a meeting would advance progress or be a ""premature reward.""

Hillary Clinton is preparing to launch her presidential campaign. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times reports the campaign will reintroduce her by focusing on biographical details from her childhood and early career. Dan Balz of The Washington Post adds that her campaign will launch with a much larger staff than anticipated and will focus on smaller, more personal events.

The corruption indictment of Senator Robert Menendez includes a charge that his staff solicited funds for a super PAC. Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast notes this could lead to increased scrutiny of similar campaign finance practices among other lawmakers.

With Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio officially in the GOP presidential race, Republican operatives are facing pressure to choose a campaign. The passage cites examples such as operative Matt Maroney joining Chris Christie's team and pollster Tony Fabrizio signing on with Rand Paul's campaign."
11430,"Jake Tapper has been named the new anchor of CNN's Sunday morning political program, ""State of the Union,"" starting in June. He will continue his roles as CNN's chief Washington correspondent and anchor of the weekday newscast ""The Lead."" Tapper, who joined CNN in 2013, is succeeding Candy Crowley, who left the program in December. The passage also notes that other networks, including CBS and NBC, have recently changed anchors on their Sunday political shows. Tapper will be the second current anchor, along with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, to work both weekdays and Sunday mornings."
11773,"Oscar-winning rapper-turned-actor Common has joined the cast of the Warner Bros. action movie ""Suicide Squad,"" directed by David Ayer. The film, which is in production in Toronto, is about imprisoned villains recruited by a government agency for covert operations. The cast includes Jared Leto as the Joker, Will Smith as Deadshot, and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, with possible cameos by Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and Ben Affleck as Batman. Details of Common's role have not been revealed. Common was recently in ""Run All Night"" and won an Oscar for best original song for the movie ""Selma."""
11800,"Warren Weinstein, a 73-year-old American aid worker, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January that targeted an al Qaeda compound on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. An Italian aid worker, Giovanni Lo Porto, was also killed in the strike. U.S. officials stated they were unaware the hostages were at the location.

Weinstein was abducted by gunmen from his home in Lahore, Pakistan, in 2011. Al Qaeda later claimed responsibility and demanded the U.S. end airstrikes in Pakistan, but the U.S. government refused to bargain. Weinstein, who worked as a contractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development, was described as a dedicated development expert with a history of service, including with the Peace Corps. He suffered from a heart condition and severe asthma.

His wife, Elaine Weinstein, expressed heartbreak and said the U.S. government would conduct an independent investigation. She criticized the U.S. and Pakistani governments for being ""inconsistent and disappointing"" in their efforts to secure his release but ultimately blamed his captors for his death."
11803,"South Korean Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo has offered to resign amid a political scandal. The scandal arose after a tycoon, Sung Woan-jong, died in an apparent suicide and left a note listing names and cash amounts given to top officials, including Lee. Sung himself was under investigation for fraud and bribery. Lee and seven other politicians with links to President Park Geun-hye are now under investigation by a special prosecutor's team. Lee has denied the allegations. President Park called the resignation ""regrettable"" and condemned political corruption. Lee will remain in his role until the President accepts his resignation, but he has transferred his duty of chairing Cabinet meetings to the deputy prime minister. President Park is currently in Peru and is expected back in South Korea on April 27."
11871,"Based on the passage, Corinthian Colleges Inc. is shutting down its remaining 28 campuses, a move that followed the U.S. Department of Education curtailing its access to federal student aid. The passage describes Corinthian as one of the worst ""predator colleges,"" which are for-profit schools that offer dubious degrees, burden students with high debt, and are heavily funded by federal money.

Key statistics from the passage include:
*   For-profit colleges enroll 13% of the nation's college students but account for nearly half of all student loan defaults.
*   These colleges reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money.
*   Their cost is reportedly 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college.
*   The average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout.

The business model of these colleges involves aggressively recruiting low-income students for online classes with low operational costs. Following the Corinthian shutdown, hundreds of its graduates organized a ""debt strike,"" and the Department of Education signaled a willingness to forgive some loans. The passage also notes that enrollment at the University of Phoenix, the largest for-profit college, has fallen by half, and that numerous state attorneys general have investigated the industry for rule-breaking."
11884,"Based on the passage, Kabul is a city that has grown in population but declined economically, anxiously awaiting its future. Afghans who previously worked with NATO, such as English speakers, now find themselves jobless, blacklisted, and homeless, fearing reprisals. Areas once bustling with foreigners, like Chicken Street and certain restaurants, are now deserted. The remnants of the American military presence, including vast lines of idle machinery and supply trucks, sit unused, leaving their drivers with devalued vehicles. In contrast, wedding palaces continue to proliferate and appear busy. The city's lights, which NATO helped keep on, symbolize the uncertainty, as residents wonder how long they will continue to glow after the final American troop withdrawal."
11885,"Based on a Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips, award ticket availability varies significantly among the five biggest U.S. airlines. Southwest Airlines ranked first, offering the most award tickets (11.9 million, or 11.5% of its seats), which a spokesperson attributed to policies like ""Every Seat is an Award Seat"" and no fees. JetBlue ranked last, offering the fewest award tickets (892,000, or 4.5% of its seats). The rankings for the other airlines were Delta in second, United in third, and American in fourth.

The passage advises consumers to book award travel carefully to get the best value, suggesting they avoid using miles on inexpensive routes. It also notes that other factors are important, such as customer satisfaction, where Southwest and JetBlue scored highest, and fees, which Southwest does not charge."
11890,"Based on the passage provided, in June 2012, James Holmes opened fire in a Colorado cinema during a screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" killing 12 people and injuring 70. At the time, authorities said he wore body armor, carried multiple guns, and resembled the Joker. Holmes admits to the shootings but has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming he was having a ""psychotic episode."" The prosecution is seeking the death penalty.

Before the shooting, Holmes was a 27-year-old doctoral student in neuroscience with a history of high academic achievement. In the months leading up to the incident, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, made threats to a professor, and was seeing a psychiatrist who was concerned he was a danger to others. He also sent a text message to a fellow student mentioning ""dysphoric mania"" and warning her to stay away from him. A jury will decide his fate. His parents have requested his life be spared, stating he is ""gripped by a severe mental illness."""
11891,"Prosperity gospel pastor Creflo Dollar is responding to criticism of his campaign to purchase a Gulfstream G650 jet, which is reported to cost $65 million. In a recent address, Dollar claimed the ""devil"" was trying to discredit him and told his congregants he never asked them for money for the plane. The passage notes, however, that in March he had solicited donations in a video from ""friends from around the world."" The original fundraising campaign sought $300 from 200,000 people. Dollar justifies the need for a new jet by citing two accidents involving his current 31-year-old plane and stating he has over 3 million supporters worldwide to visit. The fundraising page has been taken down, but donations are still possible on the church's gift page. The passage also defines prosperity gospel as a theology that promises wealth and health to those who tithe 10% of their income."
